Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: or
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Pathetic.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: (lighting up again) Take it, and leave this place! (He produces a fragment.) The Day of Reckoning has not yet come.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Yikes...
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: If she keeps going the wrong way...
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Oh, evil paradox. Where did you take Millie? This is her sister, and I'm worried sick about her! It's all my fault. I can't believe I left her alone after our stupid argument. She must be furious! I need to see her again so I can apologize. But I don't know if I can or ever will. I've become a victim of this mishap, too. I feel so guilty, so responsible. If only I'd been able to find the keepsake she was looking for.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: (nods) The Oracle Drive! (A light flashes from the drive and Serah's weapon lights up. )
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Observers?
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Are you a corporal in Blitz Squadron?
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: I was so close! I can't believe things unraveled the way they did! I came here to find the tablet of seals, an invaluable relic of the ancient city of Paddra. When I finally found it, I was immediately swept away by the paradox. My dream was to make the front page of the paper. 'Gorgeous and Talented Scientist Makes Amazing Discovery!' I found the tablet near the fal'Cie excavation site. How I want to decode it before anyone else!
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Augusta Tower is the central information processing facility of the Academy. The entire edifice is occupied by the machinery of an artificial intelligence that possesses unprecedented processing power. It also houses the Proto fal'Cie Project, an ambitious plan to create a man-made fal'Cie. Here, too, is recorded the forbidden history--although no human survives to remember it.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: They learn that Mog was somehow swept up in the winds of time and carried far from his friends and family. But now, at last, he can go home again. But will he? Mog is undecided. His home and its memories belong to the past. His journey with Serah belongs to the present. He knows where he belongs.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: If I had one last wish, it would be to see a picture of my daughter again. My colleagues are nosy so I usually find myself a quiet corner where I can look at the picture in peace.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Bye. (They vanish.)
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: They land.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Serah and Noel are trying to save the people of Academia from the C'ieth apocalypse when they encounter Yeul and learn a shocking truth. She is a seeress doomed to be reborn, over and over, and Caius is her immortal guardian. They also learn that the artificial fal'Cie is behind the Academia terror. To escape the trap it has laid for them, they must battle it in virtual space. But can it really be destroyed?
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The Proto fal'Cie has run amok and turned against the very people it was built to protect. The citizens of Academia are being transformed into C'ieth, and Yeul is slain by one of the monsters. Amidst the chaos, Caius appears before Serah and Noel, goading them on. What does he want? Is this an elaborate trap? The pair enter another gate, hoping to find answers on the far side.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The Yaschas Massif, 10 AF. The research labs have asked Academy security officer Brenda to bring them a behemoth fang, and she needs your help. The problem is that the fang has to be in pristine condition, and it will doubtless be damaged if anyone tries to use military weapons against the beast. If you only use swords and bows, you should be able to defeat a behemoth and still retrieve an intact fang.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Phh. Change is the constant. (He appears in green energy before the party.)
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: After talking to Hope...
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Impressive.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: In 13 AF, the Academy built the Augusta Tower as a central information processing facility, with an enormous artificial intelligence at its core. But now, centuries in the future, the system has suddenly begun to run amok. Somehow, the network system was attacked--from somewhere in the future. When the Academy tried to respond and shut down the system, it was too late. The AI had already taken control of much of the Academy.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Help him figure out his name.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Noel doesn't think Caius is behind this mayhem. Then who is?
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Pray for all the things in this world And believe in the power of our love Sing a song of tomorrow Now we are not alone and we come to life again A new will come to you, for youuuuu and meee.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: <Movies>
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Kupppo!!!
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Foreign axiomatic system overwriting operating rules. Immediate paradox resolution required.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: He's angrier than before...
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Now the tower back in 200 AF should be open to us, kupo!
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: I recognize this picture frame! That's mine! I can't thank you enough! Just looking at my little girl's smile every morning gets me through the hardest of days. I bet she's grown up so much. How I wish I could see her. But I need to stop thinking like this and move on. I had a wonderful life. No regrets. You're too kind for granting me my last wish. May the goddess bless you with good fortune.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: 2-
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: (auto-talk) Threat level 'Omega.'
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: In the village of Oerba, Serah and Noel see that things are not as they were once before. Twisted mockeries of humans sprawl lifeless among the buildings. The scars of war that should have long since faded appear fresh and raw. Is this the world of the past? Or is it the reflection of someone's memory? Serah hears a faint voice calling her, and sets off to investigate...
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Noel walks away, irritated.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: He's teasing again!
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Once more...
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: You unlock the door!
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Let's follow him!
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: But Noel's a hunter.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: He is now outside Headquarters on Shiva, with Serah, Noel, Hope and Mog around him.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The world is stripped of growth, of life. The water runs dry, and even the winds grow still. Everything withers away in a slow death. It's a world with no hope, no future, nothing. A forsaken world. That's the world in which I was born.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: I see. Valhalla... otherwise known as the Unseen World.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: (turns to him and nods) Yes. (She raises her hand and a jet of orange energy shoots into the air. A creature instantly recognizable to any regular player of Final Fantasy as a moogle appears, holding a rod with a clock attached.)
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: If you win...
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Serah, Noel, and Hope strike a pact. They resolve to work together in their own timelines to avoid the prophesized catastrophe.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Ooh Oh, yeah yeah.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The Bresha Ruins, 300 AF. The bounty hunter Thurston has a brilliant idea for getting rid of all the monsters in the area--blow up the entire ruins using explosives. He's asked the Commander to look around the ruins to see if the plan is safe to conduct. Talk to the Commander and find out what he has discovered.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: It is now raining in the ruins.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Time flows slowly here on the great plains. Though it seems peaceful now, great war machines once stalked these prairie lands, instruments of the fal'Cie in the conflict that erupted between Cocoon and Gran Pulse and which became known as the War of Transgression. What's worse, the people whisper, is that some of them still remain. To avoid damage and decay, the legendary weapons only appear in certain weather conditions. The hunter brave enough to face and defeat one of these monster machines will become a hero in his own time.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Good morning!
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: (auto-talk) They are taking up position in front of the wall.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: More monsters appear.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Yep. (They move forward.)
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The Yaschas Massif, 10 AF. Excavation worker Cole enjoys collecting retro electronic gadgets, and there's a particular battery model from ten years ago that'd he'd love to get his hands on. Although it no longer exists in this time, such an item might have been sucked into a spacetime vortex--and if so, Mog would be just the moogle to find it.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: I won't ask then. (She holds up the artefact.)
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: And once more...
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: He doesn't look amused.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Will you help me find a way to sprout--to grow? I can't see very well here, but you two might be able to find something.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: In 400 AF, the Academy is the de facto government. Their crowning achievement is Academia, a magnificent city which surpasses any that existed on Cocoon under the fal'Cie hegemony.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Serah gasps, but it's too late; it's already activated. She is pushed back by some energy.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: In the year 20 AF, the Bresha Ruins suddenly experienced an influx of monstrous intruders. A paradox was thought to be the cause, but before an investigation could be launched, the situation was already out of hand. The government all but abandoned the area, and appealed to the general populace for possible solutions. The ruins crawled with mercenaries and researchers, looking to make names for themselves in what had become an unregulated, lawless district. As the situation continued to deteriorate, all attempts to stem the invasion ended in wasted time and resources.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Greetings, young man and young lady! How would you like to test your knowledge with Captain Cryptic's Confounding Quiz!?
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The village of Oerba is returned to how it once was. The strange distortion that threatened to swallow it is safely dispelled. But here and there, small fissures in space still remain. These fissures confound scientists. Are they a type of gate? Are they singularities, in the process of giving birth to incomplete spacetimes?
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: The Vile Peaks.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Morning!
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Serah? You said you met my sister. What did she look like? What was she wearing?
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Live Trigger An artefact is something that 'doesn't belong' in this time. What else can Noel tell me?
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: The Academy's central information processing facility, the Augusta tower, has been taken over by the artificial intelligence. The initial malfunction was caused by an attack from the future. Serah and Noel resolve the paradox and drive away the attacker. But who-or what- was he? And what did we want? The mystery unsolved, Serah and Noel leave the tower.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Serah and Noel return from Oerba to find that by changing the future, they have also changed the past. Hope's memories are different, and the prophecy recorded on the Oracle Drive now shows a horrific scene--they see the end of the world as Caius causes Cocoon to plummet into Pulse.
Predicted: CHARACTER, Actual: ACTION, Dialogue: Serah and Noel have changed the future. The Proto fal'Cie that threatened Academia is no more, and in the sky floats the Thirteenth Ark. The people have built a society with their own hands, using technology of their own devising. However, the day when Cocoon is prophesized to fall is drawing closer. The Academy has put into motion an ambitious project to avert the catastrophe.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: (rebuffed by a magical barrier) Ouch.
Predicted: ACTION, Actual: CHARACTER, Dialogue: Threat level 'Sigma.' All sections of Academia on high alert.
