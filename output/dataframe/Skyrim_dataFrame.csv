I'm sure he could help you out. It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made it without your help today. Listen, you should go to Solitude and join up with the Imperial Legion.

I wouldn't have made it without your help today. You know, you should go to Windhelm and join the fight for free Skyrim. You've seen the true face of the Empire here today.

Stay as long as you like. If there's anything else you need, just let me know. There's something you can do for me. For all of us here. The Jarl needs to know if there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless... We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.",CHARACTER,Gerdur,female

The Jarl needs to know there's a dragon on the loose. Riverwood is defenseless... We need to get word to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun to send whatever soldiers he can. If you'll do that for me, I'll be in your debt.",CHARACTER,Alvor,male
"Hadvar, did you really see a dragon? What did it look like? Did it have big teeth?",CHARACTER,Dorthe,female
"Hush, child. Don't pester your cousin.",CHARACTER,Sigrid,female
"Well, I better get back to work. You two can make yourselves at home.",CHARACTER,Alvor,male
"It's nice to be back in a friendly spot, huh? Listen, I'm going to lay up here for awhile. You can make your own way to Solitude from here. I recommend heading to Whiterun, just down the road from here. From there you can take a carriage to Solitude.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male

Safe travels.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Gate Guard,male
"At the Dragonsreach castle, the prisoner approaches Balgruuf, already talking with his advisors.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I only council caution. We cannot afford to act rashly in times like these.,CHARACTER,Proventus,male

"My lord, please. This is no time for rash action. I just think we need more action before we act. I just...",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"Who's this, then?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
His housecarl approaches.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's the meaning of this interruption? Jarl Balgruuf is not receiving any visitors.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
I have news from Helgen. About the dragon attack.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, that explains why the guards let you in. Come on then, the Jarl will want to speak to you personally. Alvor sent me. Riverwood is in danger.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Gerdur sent me. Riverwood is in danger.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As Housecarl, my job is to deal with all dangers that Jarl or his people. So, you have my attention. Now, explain yourself.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
A dragon has destroyed Helgen.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You know about Helgen? The Jarl will want to speak with you personally. Approach.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
I was told to give the message directly to the Jarl.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Whatever you have to say to the Jarl, you can say to me. I'm starting to think... Balgruuf: It's all right, Irileth. I want to hear what he has to say.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"The player approaches the throne. The line changes slightly, depending on if one talks about Riverwood and refuses to tell Irileth about it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's this about Riverwood being in danger?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"A dragon destroyed Helgen. Gerdur/Alvor is afraid Riverwood is next. • Alvor? The smith, isn't he? Reliable, solid fellow. • Gerdur? Owns the lumber mill, if I'm not mistaken... Pillar of the community.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not prone to flights of fancy...,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"• So, you were at Helgen? You saw this dragon with your own eyes? • And you're sure Helgen was destroyed by a dragon? This wasn't some Stormcloak raid gone wrong?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Yes. I had a great view while the Imperials were trying to cut off my head.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? You're certainly...forthright about your criminal past. But it's none of my concern who the Imperials want to execute. Especially now. What I want to know is what exactly happened at Helgen.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The Imperials were about to execute Ulfric Stormcloak. Then the dragon attacked.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I should have guessed Ulfric would be mixed up in this.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The dragon destroyed Helgen. And last I saw it was heading this way.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By Ysmir, Irileth was right!",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"What do you say now, Proventus? Shall we continue to trust in the strength of our walls? Against a dragon?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"My lord, we should send troops to Riverwood at once. It's in the most immediate danger. If that dragon is lurking in the mountains...",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
The Jarl of Falkreath will view that as a provocation! He'll assume we're preparing to join Ulfric's side and attack him! We should not--,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"Enough! I'll not stand idly by while a dragon burns my hold and slaughters my people! Irileth, send a detachment to Riverwood at once.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Yes, my Jarl.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my duties.",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
That would be best.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
His advisors leave.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well done. You sought me out, on your own initiative. You've done Whiterun a service, and I won't forget it. Here, take this as a small token of my esteem. There is another thing you could do for me. Suitable for someone of your particular talents, perhaps. Come, let's go find Farengar, my court wizard. He's been looking into a matter related to these dragons and...rumors of dragons.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Balgruuf leads the player to the Farengar Secret-Fire's office.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Farengar, I think I've found someone who can help you with your dragon project. Go ahead and fill him in with all the details.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"So the Jarl thinks you can be of use to me? Oh yes, he must be referring to my research into the dragons. Yes, I could use someone to fetch something for me. Well, when I say fetch, I really mean delve into a dangerous ruin in search of an ancient stone tablet that may or may not actually be there.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
All right. Where am I going and what am I fetching?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Straight to the point, eh? No need for tedious hows and whys. I like that. Leave those details to your betters, am I right?",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
What does this have to do with dragons?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, no mere brute mercenary, but a thinker -- perhaps even a scholar? You see, when the stories of dragons began to circulate, many dismissed them as mere fantasties, rumors. Impossibilities. One sure mark of a fool is to dismiss anything that falls outside his experience as being impossible. But I began to search for information about dragons -- where had they gone all those years ago? And where were they coming from?",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
So what do you need me to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"{skip to ""I, ah, learned...""}",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
Just tell me what you need me to do.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You are eager to begin your adventure. Excellent. The sooner begun, the sooner done, eh? I, ah, learned of a certain stone tablet said to be housed in Bleak Falls Barrow -- a ""Dragonstone,"" said to contain a map of dragon burial sites. Go to Bleak Falls Barrow, find this tablet -- no doubt in the main chamber -- and bring it to me. Simplicity itself.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
"Oh, you mean this old stone? (Give Dragonstone to Farengar)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! You already found it! You are cut from a different cloth than the usual brutes the Jarl foists on me. (skip to ""So what about my reward"" turn-in options)",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
!,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• Off to Bleak Falls Barrow with you. The Jarl is not a patient man. Neither am I, come to think of it.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What can you tell me about Bleak Falls Barrow?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"An old tomb, built by the ancient Nords, perhaps dating back to the Dragon War itself. Ah. Maybe you just want to know how to get there. It's near Riverwood, a miserable little village a few miles south of here. I'm sure some of the locals can point you in the right direction once you get there.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
How do you know this stone tablet is in Bleak Falls Barrow?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well. Must preserve some professional secrets, mustn't we? I have my sources...reliable sources.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
Tell me more about the Dragon War.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. Even I used to think it was just a myth. But not anymore. The Dragon War was a real event, although only the barest glimmer of the actual events has come down to us. Far back in the Mythic Era, the dragons were worshipped as gods in Skyrim. Many of the monumental ruins that still dot the landscape were, in fact, built as temples to the dragons. The details are lost, but at some point the Nords rebelled. After a long and terrible war, the Nords overthrew their dragon overlords.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
"So, were all the dragons killed in the Dragon War?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, no. Many were killed, of course. But many survived into historical times. Why, this very palace was built by one of Balgruuf's ancestors to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name -- Dragonsreach.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
Have you encountered any dragons?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sadly, no. My work affords me few opportunities for such an adventure. Perhaps some hero will bring one to Dragonsreach, like old Olaf One-Eye once did. What a fascinating conversation that would be!",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
"The player travels to the mountaintop dungeon, visible for miles in the Riverwood area. Inside, some bandits are talking.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks.",CHARACTER,Bandit 1,male
What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!,CHARACTER,Bandit 2,female
Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.,CHARACTER,Bandit 1,male
"Once they're dead, they find Arvel the Swift moaning downstairs, caught in a spider's netting. A spider attacks.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Is...is someone coming? Is that you Harknir? Bjorn? Soling? No. Not again! Ah, kill it. Kill it! Get me out of here!",CHARACTER,Arvel,male
Afterwards...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You. Over here! You did it. You killed it. Now cut me down before anything else shows up.,CHARACTER,Arvel,male
Where's the golden claw?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, the claw. I know how it works. The claw, the markings, the door in the Hall of Stories. I know how they all fit together! Help me down, and I'll show you. You won't believe the power the Nords have hidden there.",CHARACTER,Arvel,male
Hand over the claw first!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Does it look like I can move? You have to cut me down, first.",CHARACTER,Arvel,male
Fine. Let me see if I can cut you down.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sweet breath of Arkay, thank you.",CHARACTER,Arvel,male
The player hacks the webs.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
It's coming loose. I can feel it.,CHARACTER,Arvel,male
"Once free, he bolts off into the trap-filled dungeon behind him.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You fool, why should I share the treasure with anyone?",CHARACTER,Arvel,male
"The chase leads into a draugr-filled crypt, where Arvel is slain by undead he's conversing with a hooded woman.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text. Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-refernence the names with the other later texts.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
"Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable... Now, let me show you something else I found...very intriguing...I think your employers may be interested as well... Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
He notices the player's prize.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way.,CHARACTER,Farengar,male
So what about my reward?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'll have to see the Jarl about that. Maybe his steward, Avenicci. I'm sure one of them will pay you appropriately.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
I got you the Dragonstone. What next?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That is where your job ends and mine begins. The work of the mind, sadly undervalued in Skyrim. My...associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me. So, your information was correct after all. And we have our friend to thank for recovering it for us.",CHARACTER,Farengar,male
You went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work. Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"In the middle of the conversation, Balgruuf's housecarl runs in.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Farengar! Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby. You should come, too.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?,CHARACTER,Farengar,male
I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun I don't know if we can stop it. Let's go.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
They go to meet with the Jarl upstairs. An anxious guard is with them.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Yes, my lord.",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Uh...that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast...faster than anything I've ever seen.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life...I thought it would come after me for sure.",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it. Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Good. Don't fail me.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
He notices the player standing there.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again. I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon. You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here. But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar. As a token of my esteem, I have instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city. And please accept this gift from my personal armory.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.,CHARACTER,Farengar,male
No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
As you command.,CHARACTER,Farengar,male
"One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Irileth and the player go to the main gate, where her men are readied.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here's the situation. A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
What?,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
A dragon?,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
We're in for it.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
You heard right! I said a dragon! I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
But Housecarl...how can we attack a dragon?,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to face one in battle. But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fall. This dragon is threatening our homes...our families. Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
We're so dead...,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it -- the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age. The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me! Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Yeah!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Damn right!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Yeah!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Let's move out.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Together, the team approaches the watchtower. It was always in ruins, but now has a cloak of flames to boot.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here. I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere. Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
A frantic guard flees from the garrison.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"I don't know! Kynareth save us, here he comes again...",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"The dragon crests the nearest mountain, making a beeline for the watchtower guards.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Talos save us! It's a dragon!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Slay it! Slay the dragon!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
I can't get a bead on him!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"Come down here and fight, you coward!",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"The dragon is eventually weakened and grounded. The player deals the coup de grace, causing the dragon to speak.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Dovahkiin! No!!,CHARACTER,Mirmulnir,male
"Let's make sure that overgrown lizard is really dead. Damned good shooting, boys!",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
What's happening?!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Everybody get back!,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Oddly enough, the dragon's soul is instantly absorbed into the player, which surprises the Nord guardsmen and Irileth.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I can't believe it! You're...Dragonborn...,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Dragonborn? What do you mean?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In the very oldest tales, back from when there were still dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power. That's what you did, isn't it? Absorbed that dragon's power?",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
I don't know what happened to me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's only one way to find out. Try to Shout...that would prove it.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
I think you may be right.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's only one way to find out. Try to Shout...,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Yes. I think I am. You can Shout now. That can only mean one thing. You must be Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"According to the old legends, only the Dragonborn can Shout without training, the way the dragons do.",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
Dragonborn? What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 2,male
That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn. Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
I've never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 3,male
"There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in...forever.",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. You must be one!,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 4,male
"What do you say, Irileth? You've being awfully quiet.",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 2,male
"Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 3,male
"Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about. Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them. But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 4,male
I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this. I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword over tales and legends.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"If you really are Dragonborn, like out of the old tales, you ought to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 2,male
"The player Shouts, almost knocking a guard off his feet with but a word.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
By the gods! What manner of power is that?,CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard 2,male
"That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are Dragonborn, then...",CHARACTER,Whiterun Guard,male
"That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few. I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us. You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"As one walks the steps of Dragonsreach, a strange Shout-like rumble is heard see Balgruuf.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
You heard the summons. What else could it mean? The Greybeards...,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.,CHARACTER,Hrongar,male
So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"The watchtower was destroyed, but we killed the dragon.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I knew I could count on Irileth. But there must be more to it than that.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Turns out I may be something called ""Dragonborn.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Dragonborn? What do you know about the Dragonborn?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
That's just what the men called me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not just the men. The Greybeards seem to think the same thing.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
I killed the dragon. I think I deserve a reward.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's no question about that. It was a mighty deed. You've earned a place of honor among the heroes of Whiterun. But there must be more to it than that. Did something...strange...happen when the dragon died?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"When the dragon died, I absorbed some kind of power from it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
So it's true. The Greybeards really were summoning you.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The Greybeards?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Masters of the Way of the Voice. They live in seclusion high on the slopes of the Throat of the World.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
What do these Greybeards want with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Dragonborn is said to be uniquely gifted in the Voice -- the ability to focus your vital essence into a Thu'um, or Shout. If you really are Dragonborn, they can teach you how to use your gift.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun? That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar! This hasn't happened in...centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!",CHARACTER,Hrongar,male
"Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here? Capable as he may be, I don't see any signs of him being this, what, ""Dragonborn.""",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
Nord nonsense? Why you puffed-up ignorant...these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire.,CHARACTER,Hrongar,male
Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"I meant no disrespect, of course. It's just that...what do these Greybeards want with him?",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"That's the Greybeards' business, not ours. Whatever happened when you killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it. If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue? You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards. It's a tremendous honor. I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again...I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that? High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world. I wonder if the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before. No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you. You've done a great service to me and my city, Dragonborn. By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant. I assign you Lydia as a personal housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office. I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we? We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn. Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Yes, my lord.",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's it mean to be Dragonborn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, in the old tales, the Dragonborn heroes would use the power of their Voice to defeat the enemies of Skyrim. Wulfharth was Dragonborn. Talos, too -- the founder of the Empire, back in the good old days. In the very oldest tales, back from when there were still dragons in Skyrim, the Dragonborn would slay dragons and steal their power.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Who are the Greybeards?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They're the Masters of the Way of the Voice -- of Shouting. They live up on top of the Throat of the World. If you're really Dragonborn, they'll want to talk to you. In the old stories, they always summon the Dragonborn for training.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
How can you protect Whiterun from the dragons?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"With good planning and constant vigilance. Even now, my court wizard, Farengar, continues his research into ways we might drive back these terrors. We must also have ample reserves of water to combat the fires that will surely spread after an attack. But our greatest weapon? Courage. For if we cannot kill the beast, we must at least have the tenacity to drive it back. Until brave heroes step forward to destroy these monsters, that is the best we can do.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"With the destination clear, the player reaches Ivarstead, the small village locked, but during this quest, one can enter. A monk goes to meet the player.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So...a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I'm answering your summons.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We will see if you truly have the gift. Show us, Dragonborn.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
You call me Dragonborn. What does that mean?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"First, let us see if you truly are Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"The player shouts, making them stagger backwards.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar. I am Master Arngeir. I speak for the Greybeards. Now tell me, Dragonborn, why have you come here?",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Who are you? What is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We are the Greybeards, followers of the Way of the Voice. You stand in High Hrothgar, on the slopes of Kynareth's sacred mountain. Here we commune with the voice of the sky, and strive to achieve balance between our inner and outer selves.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I want to find out what it means to be Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
You mean I'm not the only Dragonborn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind. Whether you are the only Dragonborn of this age...that is not ours to know. You are the only one that has been revealed thus far. That is all I can say.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"I'm answering your summons, Master.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We are honored to welcome a Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. We will do our best to teach you how to use your gift in fulfillment of your destiny.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
What is my destiny?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That is for you to discover. We can show you the Way, but not your destination.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I'm ready to learn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You have shown that you are Dragonborn. You have the inborn gift. But do you have the discipline and temperament to follow the path laid out for you? That remains to be seen. Without training, you have already taken the first steps toward projecting your Voice into a Thu'um, a Shout. Not let us see if you are willing and able to learn. When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power. All Shouts are made up of three Words of Power. As you master each Word, your Shout will become progressively stronger. Master Einarth will now teach you ""Ro,"" the second Word in Unrelenting Force. ""Ro"" means ""balance"" in the dragon tongue. Combine it with Fus -- ""Force"" -- to focus your Thu'um more sharply.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Ro...,CHARACTER,Einarth,male
One of the monks inscribes his knowledge on the floor. The player learns the information immediately.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You learn a new word like a master...you truly do have the gift. But learning a Word of Power is only the first step...you must unlock its meaning through constant practice in order to use it in a Shout. Well, that is how the rest of us learn Shouts. As Dragonborn, you can absorb a slain dragon's life force and knowledge directly. As part of your initiation, Master Einarth will allow you to tap into his understanding of ""Ro.""",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
The player absorbs some information from the fellow Greybeard.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Now let us see how quickly you can master your new Thu'um. Use your Unrelenting Force shout to strike the targets as they appear.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Flik Lo...Sah!,CHARACTER,Borri,male
The player defeats Borri's target.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well done. Again.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Flik Lo...Sah!,CHARACTER,Einarth,male
The player snaps the second target.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You learn quickly. Once more.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Flik Lo...Sah!,CHARACTER,Wulfgar,male
He smashes the final monk's target.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Impressive. Your Thu'um is precise. You show great promise, Dragonborn. We will perform your next trial in the courtyard. Follow Master Borri.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
They enter the snowy expanse outside the living quarters.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We will now see how you learn a completely new Shout. Master Borri will teach you ""Wuld,"" which means ""Whirlwind.""",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Wuld...,CHARACTER,Borri,male
"Like a previous master, Borri inscribes the word on the ground for the player to learn immediately.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You must hear the Word within yourself before you can project it into a Thu'um.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
The player learns it.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Approach Master Borri and he will gift you his knowledge of ""Wuld.""",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
One absorbs the information like a dragon's soul.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Now we will see how quickly you can master a new Shout. Master Wulfgar will demonstrate Whirlwind Sprint. Then it will be your turn. Master Borri.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Bex!,CHARACTER,Borri,male
Borri opens a gate.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Wuld. Nah...Kest!,CHARACTER,Wulfgar,male
"Wulfgar quickly runs through it before it closes, only a moment later.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Now it is your turn. Stand next to me. Master Borri will open the gate. Use your Whirlwind Sprint to pass through before it closes.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Bex!,CHARACTER,Borri,male
"Mimicking Wulfgar, one dashes through like a pro.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Your quick mastery of a new Thu'um is...astonishing. I'd heard the stories of the abilities of Dragonborn, but to see it for myself...",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I thought it was this easy for everyone.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No. Indeed not. But beware that your skill does not outstrip your wisdom. You are now ready for your last trial.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I don't know how I do it. It just happens.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You were given this gift by the gods for a reason. It is up to you to figure out how best to use it. You are now ready for your last trial.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Thank you. What's next?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You are now ready for your last trial. Retrieve the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, our founder, from his tomb in the ancient fane of Ustengrav. Remain true to the Way of the Voice, and you will return.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
One can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Why are the dragons returning? Does it have something to do with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No doubt. The appearance of a Dragonborn at this time is not an accident. Your destiny is surely bound up with the return of the dragons. You should focus on honing your Voice, and soon your path will be made clear.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"Thank you, Master. I will continue my training.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. Then you will be ready for whatever lies ahead.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Surely there's more you can tell me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There is indeed much that we know that you do not. That does not mean that you are ready to understand it. Do not let your easy mastery of the Voice tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the downfall of many Dragonborn before you.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"What does it mean to be ""Dragonborn""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Dragons have the inborn ability to learn and project their Voice. Dragons are also able to absorb the power of their slain brethren. A few mortals are born with similar abilities -- whether a gift or a curse has been a matter of debate down through the centuries. What you have already learned in a few days took even the most gifted of us years to achieve. Some believe that Dragonborn are sent into the world by the gods, at times of great need. We will speak more of that later, when you are ready.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Why are Shouts in the dragon language?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Dragons have always been able to shout. Language is intrinsic to their very being. There is no difference in the dragon tongue between debating and fighting. Shouting comes as naturally to a dragon as breathing, or speaking. In mythic times, when mortalkind was in great need, the goddess Kynareth granted us the ability to speak as dragons do. For most people, long years of training are required to learn even the simplest Shout. But for you, the dragon speech is is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
There are only four of you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Five. Our leader, Paarthurnax, lives alone on the peak of the Throat of the World. When your Voice can open the path, you will know you are ready to speak to him.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"When can I meet your leader, Paarthurnax?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As I said, you will know you are ready when your Voice can open the path to him.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Tell me about the Greybeards.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We study the Way of the Voice, according to the teachings of our founder, Jurgen Windcaller. Very few are permitted to study with us here at High Hrothgar. But in your case, Dragonborn, it is a privilege to guide you towards mastery of your Voice.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Why don't the others talk?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Their Voices are too powerful for anyone not trained in the Way to withstand. Even a whisper could kill you.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Who was Jurgen Windcaller?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He was a great war leader of the ancient Nords, a master of the Voice, or Tongue. After the disaster at Red Mountain, where the Nord army was annihilated, he spent many years pondering the meaning of that terrible defeat. He finally came to realize that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Voice. He was the first to understand that the Voice should be used solely for the glory and worship of the gods, not the glory the men. Jurgen Windcaller's mastery of the Voice eventually overcame all opposition, and the Way of the Voice was born.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"What is the ""Way of the Voice""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Voice was a gift of the goddess Kynareth, at the dawn of time. She gave mortals the ability to speak as dragons do. Although this gift has often been misused, the only true use of the Voice is for the worship and glory of the gods. True Mastery of the Voice can only be achieved when your inner spirit is in harmony with your outward actions. In the contemplation of the sky, Kynareth's domain, and the practice of the Voice, we strive to achieve this balance.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
But I don't follow your philosophy. Why help me learn the Voice?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules -- the Dragon Blood itself is a gift from the gods. If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh. We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I will try to follow the Way of the Voice.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That is commendable. But remember, the Dragon Blood itself is a gift from Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift. Your destiny requires you to use your Voice -- why else would Akatosh have bestowed this gift upon you? If you remember to use your voice in service to the purpose of Akatosh, you will remain true to the Way.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"At Arngeir's behest, one visits Ustengrav, a barrow near Morthal's marshes. Necromancers are walking around the main hall.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.,CHARACTER,Conjurer,male
Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.,CHARACTER,Necromancer,female
There goes another one.,CHARACTER,Conjurer,male
Bah. Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.,CHARACTER,Necromancer,female
"They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible.",CHARACTER,Conjurer,male
"As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be.",CHARACTER,Necromancer,female
You hear that? The others must have found something!,CHARACTER,Conjurer,male
We'd better go see. These can tend to themselves for a few minutes.,CHARACTER,Necromancer,female
Shadowing them reveals they've uncovered a crypt of high-powered draugr. The by renting the inn's attic room. One goes there to investigate.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm the innkeeper. It's my business to keep track of strangers.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I'd like to rent the attic room. (10 Gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Attic room, eh? Well...we don't have an attic room, but you can have the one on the left. Make yourself at home.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"The player checks out the room, only for Delphine to enter in after them.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So you're the Dragonborn I've been hearing so much about. I think you're looking for this. We need to talk. Follow me.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Eventually one will have to give the horn back to Arngeir.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Ah! You've retrieved the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Well done. You have now passed all the trials. Come with me. It is time for us to recognize you formally as Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Him and the other monks gather in the vestibule.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You are ready to learn the final word of Unrelenting Force, ""Dah,"" which means ""Push.""",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Dah...,CHARACTER,Wulfgar,male
"With all three words together, this Shout is much more powerful. Use it wisely. Master Wulfgar will now gift you with his knowledge of ""Dah.""",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
One gets the final word and its knowledge.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You have completed your training, Dragonborn. We would Speak to you. Stand between us, and prepare yourself. Few can withstand the unbridled Voice of the Greybeards. But you are ready.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male

"Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
One can ask Arngeir about it afterwards.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What was that ceremoy all about? Were you Shouting at me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We spoke the traditional words of greeting to a Dragonborn who has accepted our guidance. The same words were used to greet the young Talos, when he came to High Hrothgar, before he became the Emperor Tiber Septim.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
What did you actually say?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah. I sometimes you forget you are not versed in the dragon tongue as we are. This is a rough translation: ""Long has the Stormcrown languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon. By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of Shor, and in the name of Atmora of Old. You are Ysmir now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it.""",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male

Now we can talk. The Greybeards seem to think you're the Dragonborn. I hope they're right.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
You're the one who took the horn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Surprised? I guess I'm getting pretty good at my harmless innkeeper act.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I was expecting someone...taller.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. The point of being in hiding is to appear to be someone you're not.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What's with all the cloak and dagger?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You can't be too careful. Thalmor spies are everywhere.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Here I am. What do you want?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Sorry, I'm supposed to be meeting someone here.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I hope you're just playing dumb. I'm the one who left the note in Ustengrav.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
The Greybeards are right. I am Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I hope so. But you'll forgive me if I don't assume that something's true just because the Greybeards say so. I just handed you the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller. Does that make me Dragonborn, too?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What do you want with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I didn't go to all this trouble on a whim. I needed to make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap. I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
You'd better have a good reason for dragging me here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It was the only way I could make sure it wasn't a Thalmor trap. I'm not your enemy. I already gave you the horn. I'm actually trying to help you. I just need you to hear me out.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I just came here for the horn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And now you have it. No harm done. I knew the Greybeards would send you for the horn if they thought you were Dragonborn. Taking it was the only way I could be sure this wasn't a Thalmor trap.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Go on. I'm listening.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Like I said in my note, I've heard that you might be Dragonborn. I'm part of a group that's been looking for you...well, someone like you, for a very long time. If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
You'd better start explaining. Fast.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll explain what I want when I want, got it? You'd already be dead if I didn't like the look of you when you walked in here. But I had to know if the rumors about you were true... I'm part of a group that's been looking for you...well, someone like you, for a very long time. If you really are Dragonborn, that is. Before I tell you any more, I need to make sure I can trust you.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I don't have time for this.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits. You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
So what's the part you're not telling me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Dragons aren't just coming back, they're coming back to life. They weren't gone somewhere all these years. They were dead, killed off centuries ago by my predecessors. Now something's happening to bring them back to life. And I need you to help me stop it.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Do you know how crazy this sounds?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha. A few years ago, I said almost the same thing to a colleague of mine. Well, it turned out he was right and I was wrong.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What makes you think dragons are coming back to life?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I know they are. I've visited their ancestral burial mounds and found them empty. And I've figured out where the next one will come back to life. We're going to go there, and you're going to kill that dragon. If we succeed, I'll tell you anything you want to know.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
How did you figure all this out?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You should know. You got the map for me. The dragonstone you got for Farengar, remember?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Right, you were at Dragonsreach when I gave it to him.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So you were paying attention. I arranged to have Farengar recover the dragonstone for me. It's what I do. I make things happen from behind the scenes. After all, here you are.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
The dragonstone was some kind of map?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. A map of ancient dragon burial sites. I've looked at which ones are now empty. The pattern is pretty clear. It seems to be spreading from the southeast, starting in the Jeralls near Riften. The one near Kynesgrove is next if the pattern holds.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
So where are we headed?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Kynesgrove. There's an ancient dragon burial mound there. If we can get there before it happens, maybe we'll learn how to stop it.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I know that mound -- high on the hill east of Kynesgrove.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. Good. Now we won't have to spend time searching for it. We should get moving. There's no time to waste.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Let's go kill a dragon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I need to get into my traveling gear. Give me a minute and I'll be ready. That's better. Let's get on the road to Kynesgrove.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Hold on. I'm not ready to go yet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I can't wait around for you to make up your mind. I'll meet you at Kynesgrove. Don't waste time getting there.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
If one inquires further before committing to Delphine's plan:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How do I know I can trust you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you don't trust me, you were a fool to walk in here in the first place.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Why did you take the horn from Ustengrav?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I knew the Greybeards would send you there if they thought you were Dragonborn. They're nothing if not predictable. When you showed up here, I knew you were the one the Greybeards sent, and not some Thalmor plant.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Why are you looking for a Dragonborn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We remember what most don't -- that the Dragonborn is the ultimate dragonslayer. You're the only one that can kill a dragon permanently by devouring its soul. Can you do it? Can you devour a dragon's soul?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Yes, that's how I first learned I was Dragonborn.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. And you'll have a chance to prove it to me soon enough.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I absorb some kind of power from dragons. That's all I can say.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
This is no time to play the reluctant hero. You either are or aren't Dragonborn. But I'll see for myself soon enough.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
That's none of your business.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You're wrong. It is my business. You may be the only one that can stop these dragons. But you'll understand that soon enough.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
You said the Thalmor are after you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. We're very old enemies. And if my suspicions are correct, they might have something to do with the dragons returning. But that isn't important right now. What is important is that you might be Dragonborn.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I don't need to prove anything to you. I'm done here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I shouldn't let you walk out of here, knowing what you know. But I guess even my paranoia has its limits. You know where to find me when you change your mind. Because you will. You have to.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Finally, they agree to visit the hill.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Orgnar, I'm traveling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Right. Happy trails.,CHARACTER,Orgnar,male

"They travel together, the leader making small talk.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I hope you're Dragonborn, I really do. But we'll find out soon enough. We may both end up dead, but at least it gets me out of Riverwood. I don't really think I'm cut out for the quiet life. I doubt the Thalmor are aware of you yet. So we should be safe from them, at least.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
They come upon Valtheim Towers.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"This is a notorious bandit hideout. But it's also the shortest way to Kynesgrove, so...we may have to kill a few bandits.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Afterward the bloodletting...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We'll cross the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then we can swing south to Kynesgrove. There's an inn near Kynesgrove -- the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course. I'm glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn't the best way to introduce myself. But old habits... you know.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female

Where's this dragon?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It flew over the town and landed on the old dragon burial mound. I don't know what it's doing up there, but I'm not waiting around to find out!",CHARACTER,Iddra,female
Come on. Hurry. It might be too late.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female

Who are you and what do you want with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm one of the last members of the Blades. A very long time ago, the Blades were dragonslayers, and we served the Dragonborn, the greatest dragonslayer. For the last two hundred years, since the last Dragonborn emperor, the Blades have been searching for a purpose. Now that dragons are coming back, our purpose is clear again. We need to stop them.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
The Blades? Who are they?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Exactly. Nobody even remembers our name these days. We used to be known across Tamriel as the protectors of the Septim Emperors. Those days are long gone, though. For the last two hundred years, we've been searching for the next Dragonborn to guide and guard, as we are sworn to do. But we never found one. Until now.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What's our next move?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The first thing we need to do is figure out what's behind the dragons. The Thalmor are our best lead. If they aren't involved, they'll know who is.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Remind me...who are the Thalmor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The faction that rules the Aldmeri Dominion. The ones who almost destroyed the Empire during the Great War, thirty years back. There's no worse enemy to humankind in Tamriel. The Empire barely survived the last war. The Thalmor don't intend to lose the next one.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What makes you think the Thalmor are bringing dragons back?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Nothing solid. Yet. But my gut tells me it can't be anybody else. The Empire had captured Ulfric. The war was basically over. Then a dragon attacks, Ulfric escapes, and the war is back on. And now the dragons are attacking everywhere, indiscriminately. Skyrim is weakened, the Empire is weakened. Who else gains from that but the Thalmor?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Why are the Thalmor after you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Before the Great War, the Blades helped the Empire against the Thalmor. Our Grand Master saw them as the greatest threat to Tamriel. At the time, that was true. Maybe it still is. So we fought them in the shadows, all across Tamriel. We thought we were more than a match for them. We were wrong.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What do you know about the dragons coming back?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not a damn thing. I was just as surprised as you to find that big black dragon here.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"I've seen that dragon before, the one that got away.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? Where?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"It was the one that attacked Helgen, when Ulfric escaped from the Imperials.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Interesting. Same dragon... Damn it, we're blundering around in the dark here! We need to figure out who's behind it all!",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"So, we need to find out what the Thalmor know about the dragons. Any ideas?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If we could get into the Thalmor Embassy...it's the center of their operations in Skyrim... Problem is, that place is locked up tighter than a miser's purse. They could teach me a few things about paranoia...",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
So how do we get into the Thalmor Embassy?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm not sure yet. I have a few ideas, but I'll need some time to pull things together... Meet me back in Riverwood. If I'm not back when you get there, wait for me. I shouldn't be long. Keep an eye on the sky. This is only going to get worse.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
She takes off down the hill.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

I don't think you were followed. Come on. I have a plan.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
They return to the hidden basement.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I figured out how we're going to get you into the Thalmor Embassy.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
You're not coming?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

That didn't take long.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Why not just fight our way in?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So that's your plan, huh? Even if you could survive, by the time you got inside, whatever documents they had would be long gone. We're there for information, remember? Trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. My way is better.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
So what's your plan? How do I infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Thalmor ambassador, Elenwen, regularly throws parties where the rich and connected cozy up to the Thalmor. I can get you into one of these parties. Once you're inside the Embassy, you get away and find Elenwen's secret files. I have a contact inside the Embassy. He's not up for this kind of high-risk mission, but he can help you. His name's Malborn. Wood elf, plenty of reason to hate the Thalmor. You can trust him. I'll get word to him to meet you in Solitude, at the Winking Skeever -- you know it? While you're doing that, I'll work on getting you an invitation to Elenwen's little party. Meet me at the Solitude stables after you've arranged things with Malborn. Any questions?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Who's this contact of yours? You're sure I can trust him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't worry about Malborn. He's not a dangerous character like you, but he hates the Thalmor at least as much as I do. He's a wood elf -- the Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges that we never hear about. Luckily they don't know who he really is, or he wouldn't be serving drinks at the Ambassador's parties.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
How am I going to get into this party?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let me handle that. You'll have a real invitation, don't worry. As long as you can act the part of a Thalmor toady, you'll get past the guards.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Once I'm inside the Embassy, then what?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's when the fun starts. You'll have to slip away from the party without raising the alarm. Then you'll need to find Elenwen's office and search her files. Malborn should be able to point you in the right direction.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I'll see you in Solitude after I meet Malborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Sounds good. Be careful.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
One seeks out Malborn at Solitude's local watering hole.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Our mutual friend sent me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Really? You're who she picked? I hope she knows what she's doing. Here's the deal. I can smuggle some equipment into the Embassy for you. Don't plan on bringing anything else with you. The Thalmor take security very seriously. Give me what you can't live without, and I'll make sure it gets into the Embassy. The rest is up to you.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
What kinds of things should I bring?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're asking me? She promised that she was sending someone who knew what they were doing... If you actually want to get out alive, I'd bring whatever you need to move quietly, and kill quickly.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
"Hold on, I need to get a few things ready.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll give you a few more minutes. I can't wait here all day. It's my neck on the line, remember.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
I'm ready. Here's what I'll need.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
---,CHARACTER,Malborn,male
"Once the swap occurs, one tracks down Delphine at the farms.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Have you given Malborn the gear you want to smuggle into the embassy?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Yes, Malborn's all set.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. I have your invitation to the party. But the only way you're going to get past the guards is if they really believe you're an invited guest. Which means you need to look the part, and not be armed to the teeth. Here, put this on. When you're ready, I'll keep the rest of your gear safe until you get back. You'll only have what Malborn smuggled in for you, plus whatever you can pick up inside.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"The player puts on the party clothes Delphine picked out, then puts away all weapons and heavy armor that would give the disguise away.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hmm. I guess that will have to do. You should pass for a real guest, at least until you open your mouth. Ready to board the carriage to the embassy?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Hold on a minute.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is no time for cold feet. I've put everything in your hands here, not least Malborn's life. Now do whatever it is you need to do, and let's get going before we miss our chance!",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I'm ready. Keep the rest of my things safe for me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't worry, it will all be waiting for you when you get back. Just make sure you get back out of there alive with the information we need. Good luck.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"A short while later, one arrives at the embassy gates. A man walks in nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah! A fellow latecomer for Elenwen's little soiree. And arriving by carriage, no less! I salute you, sir! My lateness is due more to getting lost on the way up this gods-forsaken mountain than to any desire to actually arrive late. I prefer to arrive early. Often the day before the party. So as not to miss out on any of the drinking. There's not enough drinking in the world today, wouldn't you agree?",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
A Thalmor wizard nearby acts as a bouncer.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome to the Thalmor Embassy. Your invitation, please.",CHARACTER,Wizard,male
Here you go. (Show invitation),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Thank you, sir. Go right in.",CHARACTER,Wizard,male
Is there a problem?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course not. Purely a formality. Now, I need to see your invitation.",CHARACTER,Wizard,male
Just a minute. I think I left it on the cart.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. Just bring it to me when you find it.,CHARACTER,Wizard,male
"Now then. Here's my invitation, I don't have a poisoned dagger strapped to my thigh, et cetera, et cetera.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"I'm just doing my duty, sir. Everything's in order. Welcome back, sir.",CHARACTER,Wizard,male
"Yes, yes. Now to find myself a drink.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
Go right on in. The party has already started.,CHARACTER,Wizard,male
"Inside, my friend, inside! Where only the women and drinks are cold.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
The player enters the bustling main hall.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome. I don't believe we've met. I am Elenwen, the Thalmor Ambassador to Skyrim. And you are...?",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
My name is (name). Pleased to meet you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ah yes. I remember your name from the guest list.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"Quite a party. It's my first time, you know. Where can I get a drink?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't worry, my parties are always well-stocked with the finest food and drink available in this country. But first, you were introducing yourself.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
You're Elenwen? I've heard so much about you!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Have you? All good, I trust. But you have met at a disadvantage. I'm afraid I know nothing about you... Please, tell me more about yourself. What brings you to this...to Skyrim?",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt...",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
"What is it, Malborn?",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine. Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...,CHARACTER,Malborn,male
Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"Yes, Madame Ambassador.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
He leaves.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"My apologies. We'll have to get better acquainted later. Please, enjoy yourself.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"When she leaves, Malborn is approached.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way. Let's hope we both live through this day.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
"The player can talk to the guests, mostly random luminaries from around the map. They have interesting things to say, so I'll put 'em here.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The degeneracy of the Empire is on display here in this room.,CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
What brings you to this party?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There are those in the Empire who would wish to evade their obligations to help root out the Talos heresy. Fortunately, those most opposed to the Emperor's wise policy have no branded themselves traitors as well as heretics. I am here to remind the ruling classes of Skyrim that their loyalty to the Emperor requires cooperation with the Thalmor.",CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
The Great War is long past. It's time the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion put aside their differences. Prosperity is good for everyone.,CHARACTER,Erikur,male
What brings you to this party?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You must be new to Skyrim, or you'd already know who I am. I have a stake in most anything of importance in Solitude. I feel that it's time to put aside the grievances of the past, and let peace and prosperity flourish between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. I try to do my little part. Besides, just between you and me, it's making me pots of money, hahaha.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
You sound like quite the businessman.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not every Nord is obsessed with strength, honor and skill at arms. A rare few are born with a gift for making money. My investments are my strength and my wealth is my weapon. As for honor, well, there are some luxuries even I can't afford.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
I don't recall seeing you at one of these before. And I know everyone who's anyone in Skyrim.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
I didn't know you had dealings with the Thalmor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Have you learned nothing about me? I have dealings with everyone. Now, leave me. I don't want to arouse suspicion by talking to someone that clearly does not belong here.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
Are you here on guild business?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't mention the Guild. In fact, it's better if you don't speak to me at all. This is not the place.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
I'm ready for this party to be over.,CHARACTER,Orthus,male
What brings you to this party?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ill luck. I'm a busy man and I don't have time for this sort of frivolity. But at the same time, I don't dare refuse an invitation from Elenwen.",CHARACTER,Orthus,male
You don't look happy to be here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Is it that obvious? I should take pains to seem more happy. I wouldn't want to upset our host. But the truth of it is, I have a mountain of paperwork back in Windhelm and it's not getting any smaller. I just hope this party doesn't drag on all night.",CHARACTER,Orthus,male
"If your eyes and your ears are open and your mind is free of judgment and expectation, you might learn much in this chamber.",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
Having a good time?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fair faces and fine food are well and good, but honesty is rarely so pleasing.",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
Do you visit the embassy often?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There are words spoken, and words unspoken. Beware these Thalmor, for they are adept in both languages. For this reason, I avoid them when I can.",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
I hope you're enjoying yourself.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
Do you host these parties often?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Quite often, yes. The only thing I enjoy more than luxury is sharing that luxury with those who can appreciate it. But I also enjoy learning the latest gossip and hear the most intriguing rumors.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
I can see you spared no expense.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course not. One does not gather the most important men and women of Skyrim and then serve them cheap ale and stale bread. This is only a taste of the benefits that accrue to those who align themselves with Thalmor interests.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
What does your position as Thalmor Ambassador involve?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"One of my main duties is to foster a better understanding between the Aldmeri Dominion and the people of Skyrim. I also oversee the activities of the Thalmor Justicars throughout Skyrim, although this has been unfortunately disrupted by the war.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
I've never quite understood exactly what the Justicars do.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Thalmor Justicars are so often misunderstood. Our primary goal is to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. The worship of the false god Talos contributed to the unfortunate friction that led to the Great War. Following the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat set out the terms for peaceful coexistence between the two powers. The Empire and the Dominion agree that the worship of Talos was a relic of the past, and must be eliminated in the interests of peace. But I'm sure you didn't come here for a lecture on high politics.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
What's your position on the civil war?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As long as the Empire continues to uphold its treaty obligations, my government does not concern itself with the internal politics of Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"After awhile, one goes back to the barkeep.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. Let me see if we have another bottle of that. I'll be waiting by the door for everyone to be distracted.,CHARACTER,Malborn,male
One has to find someone to cause the distraction.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
RAZELAN DISTRACTION,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What does a fellow need to do to get a drink around here?,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
You look thirsty.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My friend, you are very perceptive! I have a powerful thirst that cannot be slaked! And none of the waiters will bring me a drink. Elenwen must have told them to cut me off, the frigid bitch. Afraid I'll cause another scene, I suppose...",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Here, I brought you a drink.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, the one generous soul among a gathering of pinch-pennies and lick-spittles! If there's anything I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to call upon me!",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
Thanks. I'll let you know if I need anything.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Your wish is my command! As long as it doesn't involve much physical activity. I seem to be having trouble standing on my feet at the moment.,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Actually, there is something you could do for me.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Wonderful! I can begin to repay your generosity immediately. Say on, friend.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few minutes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Is that all? My friend, you've come to the right person. You could say that causing a scene is somewhat of a specialty of mine. Stand back and behold my handiwork.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
He walks to the center of the room.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Attention, everyone! Could I have your attention, please! I have an announcement to make! I propose a toast to Elenwen! Our mistress! I speak figuratively, of course. Nothing could be more unlikely than someone would actually want her in their bed.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
The guards draw their blades.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Although...most of you are already in bed with her! But again...I speak figuratively, of course! Fine, fine. Get your hands off me. I'll be a good boy now. Wouldn't want to offend our Thalmor overlords, would we? Someone bring me a drink, quick!",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
ERIKUR DISTRACTION,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
Did you see that serving girl? I hear elf women are insatiable...,CHARACTER,Erikur,male
Maybe I can talk to her for you. See if she's interested.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Really? Yes, maybe that would be just the thing. She seemed to be playing hard to get when I last spoke to her. Go on. See what she says. Now you've gone and gotten my hopes up again.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
One finds the serving girl.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I hope you're enjoying yourself, sir.",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
That fellow over there asked me to talk to you...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ugh. Erikur, right? He was talking to me earlier. I could tell what he was after. I hate working these parties. Some of the guests are nice, but there's always a few like Erikur. Please tell him to leave me alone. Politely. I'm sure you'll have better luck getting through to him than I would.",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
One goes back to the thane.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Have you talked to Brelas yet? I'm not a patient man, you know.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
Not yet. These things can't be rushed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha. Don't toy with me. I may just have to seize my opportunity with both hands, ha ha ha. But we'll play it your way for now.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
Yes. She said she can sneak you up to her quarters right now.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Haha. I knew it! No woman yet born has been able to resist my charms for long. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
Yes. She wants you to leave her alone.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What? That little tease! Leading me on and turning cold at the last minute. I don't think so.,CHARACTER,Erikur,male
If one lies about her advance:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hello, my dear. I got your message. Where shall we go?",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
"What? I'm sorry, sir, but you must have misunderstood. I'm not permitted to leave the party.",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
"Oh, I don't think so. I think I understand perfectly. Don't worry, my dear, I will make any necessary excuses to your employer.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
He goes over to Brelas. If one tells him the truth:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So. You think you can toy with me, is that it? No, my dear. I have my heart set on you, and I always get what I want.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression earlier. I meant no disrespect.",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
"Oh, don't worry. I'll let you make it up to me. Now, where can we go for a litle privacy, hmm?",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
The conversation always ends with:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"No, I'm sorry, but I can't go anywhere with you. I won't. Please, I must get back to my duties.",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
"Don't you dare walk away from me, you slut! Do you know who I am?",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
"Please, sir, leave me alone!",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
Now you're going to be sorry you crossed me. Elenwen! This servant girl has been throwing herself at me in a most disgusting manner.,CHARACTER,Erikur,male
"Is that so, Erikur? And you with such delicate sensibilities. It must have been most upsetting.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
I demand that you have this wench removed from my presence at once!,CHARACTER,Erikur,male
"Well. Whatever the truth of it, I'm sure a few words with Master Rulindil will have a salutary effect. Take her downstairs.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"Yes, Madame Ambassador.",CHARACTER,Thalmor Guard,female
"No! Mistress Elenwen, it's not true! I did nothing! Sir, you must tell her! You don't know what they'll do to me! Please!",CHARACTER,Brelas,female
The girl is lead downstairs with a guard.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well, I'm glad that little unpleasantness is over.",CHARACTER,Erikur,male
ONDOLEMAR DISTRACTION,CHARACTER,Erikur,male
I need your help with something.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What is it, my friend?",CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few minutes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
This is very irregular. I trust that whatever you're doing doesn't compromise my position in any way?,CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
Never mind.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't presume upon our friendship. My first loyalty is to the Thalmor, as you well know.",CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
I promise. Just a joke I want to play on someone. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hmm. Very well. I'm putting my reputation on the line for you.,CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
This is neither the time nor the place for such things. I'm surprised you would ask it of me.,CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
Ondolemar goes over to Razelan.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How dare you speak of the Thalmor in such a disgusting manner!,CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
"What? I didn't...hmm? No listen, you must have misunderstood... I would never openly insult your...that is to say...",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
Your insults and provocations have gone far enough! I'd kill you where you stand if I wasn't bound by my oath as an officer of the Aldmeri Dominion.,CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
Razalan. And you promised to behave yourself this time. Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Forgive me, Ambassador. I allowed this...fool to provoke me. The fault is mine. There is no need for further disruption on my account.",CHARACTER,Ondolemar,male
"That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What...I don't understand why everyone...never mind.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
ORTHUS DISTRACTION,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
I need your help with something.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course! I mean...assuming you don't want me to kill someone for you. I might have to draw the line there.,CHARACTER,Orthus,male
I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few minutes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's it? Sure. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually end up making a fool out of myself without even trying. Watch this.,CHARACTER,Orthus,male
Orthus goes to Razelan.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hey, Razelan, remember when you told me I'd never amount to anything? Well, I don't think you should say things like that about the Ambassador!",CHARACTER,Orthus,male
"What? I didn't...hmm? No, listen, you must have misunderstood... I would never openly insult your...that is to say...",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"I know you're drunk as usual, but that's no excuse for insulting our hostess. I don't think anyone deserves that kind of abuse! I've known plenty of elves who were perfectly decent people.",CHARACTER,Orthus,male
Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time. Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"Yes, Madame Ambassador.",CHARACTER,Thalmor Guard,female
I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"I'm sorry, Ambassador. I didn't mean to cause such a commotion. There's no need to have him thrown out on my account.",CHARACTER,Orthus,male
"Absolutely not! I protest...uh, that is, yes, of course. I still don't understand what just...oh never mind.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
JARL IDGROD DISTRACTION,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Now here is a face I did not expect to see. Be mindful, for you walk among adders.",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
I need your help with something.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
My ears are always open to a friend's request,CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
I need you to cause a scene. Get everyone's attention for a few minutes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Nothing would please me more. I'll keep their eyes away while you do what you came here for. An old woman can get away with almost anything.,CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
She walks over to Razelan's bench.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"No harm is meant to you, happy fool.",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
She prepares her distraction.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Right here! I see it in your face! The snakes writhe behind your eyes! Get away, get away from me!",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
"Hmm? Did you say snakes? Where? I hate them, always slithering they way they do...what? Are they on me?",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Begone, serpent! Begone from this house and trouble it no more! Beware of the serpent in your midst! Beware, oh people of Skyrim!",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
Razelan. And you promised to behave yourself this time. Remove him. He's disturbing the other guests.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"Yes, Madame Ambassador!",CHARACTER,Thalmor Guard,female
I protest! This is an insult to the dignity of my person! This time I'm completely innocent!,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Dear me. All this trouble over me? I think I was confused. There's no harm in him. Please, let him go.",CHARACTER,Idgrod,female
"That is absolutely untrue! Uh, that is, yes, of course. What...I don't understand why everyone...never mind.",CHARACTER,Razelan,male
AFTER THE DISTRACTION,CHARACTER,Razelan,male
"Let's go, let's go! Before anyone notices us.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
They hide in the pantry.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So far, so good. Let's hope nobody saw us slip out. We need to pass through the kitchen. Your gear is hidden in the larder. Just stay close and let me do any talking, got it? Follow me.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
The two enter the kitchen. A khajiit is sweeping up.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Who comes, Malborn? You know I don't like strange smells in my kitchen.",CHARACTER,Tsavani,female
"A guest, feeling ill. Leave the poor wretch be.",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
A guest? In the kitchens? You know this is against the rules...,CHARACTER,Tsavani,female
"Rules, is it, Tsavanni? I didn't realize that eating Moon Sugar was permitted. Perhaps I should ask the Ambassador...",CHARACTER,Malborn,male
Tss! Get out of here. I saw nothing.,CHARACTER,Tsavani,female
Your gear is in that chest. I'll lock the door behind you. Don't screw this up. Good luck.,CHARACTER,Malborn,male
The player sneaks into the embassy corridors. Guards talk nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did you see those robes march in this morning? Who're they with? More of the Emissary's treaty enforcers?,CHARACTER,Soldier 1,male
"No. They're high mages, just in from Alinor. I guess Herself is finally getting worried about all the dragon attacks.",CHARACTER,Soldier 2,male
"Ah, good. I've been wondering how we were supposed to defend this place from a dragon.",CHARACTER,Soldier 1,male
"If a dragon does show up, maybe we'll get lucky and it will eat the mages first. Might give us enough time to kill it.",CHARACTER,Soldier 2,male
Ha! I'd like to see those arrogant bastards taken down a notch. Always looking down their noses at us lowly footsloggers.,CHARACTER,Soldier 1,male
"Well, we'd better get back to our rounds.",CHARACTER,Soldier 2,male
"If one is Altmer and wearing a Thalmor disguise, it's possible to have an extra conversation with the Solar's door guard.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Why aren't you at your post, Justiciar?",CHARACTER,Wizard,male
Emissary Elenwen was asking for you inside. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Why didn't you say so? Take over my post. Make sure nobody enters the Solar.,CHARACTER,Wizard,male
"Yes sir. Sorry, sir.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Well? Get out of here and mind your rounds.,CHARACTER,Wizard,male
"Eventually, one sneaks into Elenwen's solar. A conversation occurs nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"But, I need that money! I earned it. I have my own expenses you know...",CHARACTER,Gissur,male
"Silence! Do not presume, Gissur. You are most useful, but do not presume. We have other informants who are less...offensive.",CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
"But no one else has brought you such valuable information, have they? Etienne, he's talked, hasn't he? He knows where that old man is you're looking for, he told me himself.",CHARACTER,Gissur,male
You'll get the rest of your money when we confirm his story. As agreed.,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
So he has talked! I knew it!,CHARACTER,Gissur,male
"Everyone talks, in the end. Now, I have work to do. Leave me to it, if you ever want to see the rest of your payment.",CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
Can I...I could help you. He'd talk to me. He trusts me.,CHARACTER,Gissur,male
"You'd like to come downstairs with me, is that it, Gissur? Shall we loose his bonds and put you in a cell together? You can ask him anything you like, and see how he answers.",CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
"No, no. I'll...I'll wait outside.",CHARACTER,Gissur,male
That would probably be best. Now get out!,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
"After dealing with the Thalmor ruffians, one takes their dossiers on Ulfric, time to overhear a convo with a Thalmor soldier and Etienne.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Stop. Please. I don't know anything else. Don't you think I'd have told you already?,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
Silence. You know the rules. Do not speak unless spoken to. Master Rulindil will ask the questions.,CHARACTER,Thalmor Soldier (torturing Etienne),male
Let's begin again.,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
No... for pity's sake... I've already told you everything...,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
You know the rules.,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
Noooooo!!!,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
"Start at the beginning, as usual. If you persist in this stubbornness I'll have...",CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
"No, wait! I was just... catching my breath... why wouldn't I tell you again? I don't even know anything... There's an old man. He lives in Riften. He could be this Esbern you're looking for, but I don't know. He's old and seemed kind of crazy. That's all I know.",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
And his name is...?,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
I don't know his name. Like I've told already a hundred- Ahhhh!,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
You know the rules. Just answer the questions. And where can we find this nameless old man?,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
"Like I said, I don't know! I've seen him down in the Ratway. Maybe he lives down there, but I don't know for sure.",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
That will be all for now. I must say I continue to be disappointed in your lack of cooperation. I hope next time you will do better.,CHARACTER,Rulindil,male
"What else do you want from me? I've already told you everything. Listen, if you let me go I can take you to Riften, show you where-- Gaaaaah!!!",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
"Silence, prisoner!",CHARACTER,Thalmor Soldier (torturing Brelas),neutral

No time to explain. Let's get out of here. (Free him),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Sounds good. I'll follow you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Whatever you want. But let's go, now.",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
You go ahead. I'm not done here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I guess you know what you're doing. I've got to find a way out of here.,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
No problem. Thanks for springing me. I owe you. Look me up in Riften if you make it out.,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
Who are you? What are you doing here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hey, haven't I seen you around the Flagon? I never expected to see another Guild brother down here. They grabbed me in the Ratway. The nerve of these bastards...they need to be taught a lesson.",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
They grabbed me in Riften. They seem to think I know something. They just kept asking me the same damn questions.,CHARACTER,Etienne,male
Hold on. You may know something important.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I damn well hope so. If it helps you twist them up, I'm glad to help. They're after some old guy named Esbern. Something to do with dragons, I gathered from listening to them talk when they thought I was out. I've seen a guy in Riften who they seem to think is him. Not much to go on -- I don't even know where he lives, or his name. But they seemed pretty excited about it. That's it. Now, let's get out of here.",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
I'd like to hear it all one more time.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine. Whatever you want. Can't you just kill me and get it over with? There's this old man. I've seen him around Riften. I don't know where he lives. I don't know his name. Yes, he matches the description of this Esbern guy you're looking for. Maybe it's him. Maybe it isn't. That's all I know, okay?",CHARACTER,Etienne,male
You've been very cooperative. Thanks.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Why don't you just kill me already.,CHARACTER,Etienne,male

Help! I'm being attacked!,CHARACTER,Malborn,male

Now the Thalmor will be hunting me for the rest of my life. I hope it was worth it.,CHARACTER,Malborn,male
I saw guards dragging bodies over here. Might be a way out.,CHARACTER,Etienne,male

I don't know where to go. Somewhere far away from here.,CHARACTER,Brelas,female
The three take off as one returns to Delphine in Riverwood.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You made it out alive, at least. Your gear's safe in my room, as promised. Did you learn anything useful?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
The Thalmor know nothing about the dragons.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? That seems hard to believe. You're sure about that?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Why'd you send me in if you weren't going to believe me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're right, you're right. I just...I was sure it must have been them. If not the Thalmor, who? Or...what?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"I don't know, but the Thalmor are looking for someone named Esbern.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
(same as option below),CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Yes, I'm sure. They're looking for someone called Esbern.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Esbern? He's alive? I thought the Thalmor must have got him years ago. That crazy old man... Figures the Thalmor would be on his trail, though, if they were trying to figure out what's going on with the dragons.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What would the Thalmor want with Esbern?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You mean, aside from wanting to kill every Blade they can get their hands on? Esbern was one of the Blades archivists, back before the Thalmor smashed us in the Great War. He knew everything about the ancient dragonlore of the Blades. Obsessed with it, really. Nobody paid much attention back then. I guess he wasn't as crazy as we all thought.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
So the Thalmor think the Blades know about the dragons...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ironic, right? The old enemies assume that every calamity must be a plot by the other side... Even so, we've got to find Esbern before they do. He'll know how to stop the dragons if anybody does. Do they know where he is?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
They seem to think he's hiding out in Riften.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Riften, eh? Probably down in the Ratway, then. It's where I'd go. You'd better get to Riften.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Talk to Brynjolf. He's...well-connected. A good starting point, at least.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female

I need to talk to him. I'm a friend. His life's in danger. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maybe I'm just getting soft in my old age, but I actually believe you.",CHARACTER,Vekel,male
That's a touching story. Now get outta my face.,CHARACTER,Vekel,male
Maybe this will help your memory. ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well...when you put it that way, I think I do know the old guy you're talking about.",CHARACTER,Vekel,male
Big talk for someone with a light purse.,CHARACTER,Vekel,male
"Are you going to tell me, or am I going to have to beat it out of you? (Brawl)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's no need for that. Not like he's a friend of mine or anything. Just calm down.,CHARACTER,Vekel,male
You've got a lot of nerve. But not a lot of common sense.,CHARACTER,Vekel,male

If one interrogates Dirge:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm looking for an old guy, hiding out somewhere in Riften.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I need to talk to him. I'm a friend. His life's in danger. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A friend, huh? Well... then it's probably okay if I tell you.",CHARACTER,Dirge,male

You know what? I think I do know the guy you're talking about.,CHARACTER,Dirge,male

Let me find him first. Dragons are bad for business. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, you've got a point there.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Passing on a golden opportunity is worse.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Hold on -- I just wanted some information.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And I'm busy. You help me out, and I'll help you out. That's just how it is. Yeah. I bet I know your guy. He's hiding out in the Ratway Warrens. Paying us good coin for nobody to know about it.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male

The Thalmor have found you. You need to get out of here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I'm the one the Blades have been searching for. I'm Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What's that you said? Dragonborn? Then...there really is hope after all? You'd better come inside. Quickly now. Thalmor agents have been seen in the Ratway.,CHARACTER,Esbern,male

Do you know what he's talking about?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Shh! This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore. A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries. A wise and foresighted policy, in the event.

Esbern. What are you getting at?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
You mean...you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall? Either of you?,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have to do with stopping the dragons?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female

Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets...I was only able to save a few scraps...",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female

What's the best way to get there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"From Riverwood? The road south through Falkreath is the most direct route. Or you could catch the carriage from Whiterun to Markarth and then approach from the west. Either way, the Reach is wild country these days. The Forsworn are everywhere. Best be careful.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I'll meet you at Karthspire.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Wait.,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
Why are you stopping?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?,CHARACTER,Esbern,male

Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Look here! You see how the ancient Blades revered Reman Cyrodiil. This whole place appears to be a shrine to Reman. He ended the Akiviri invasion under mysterious circumstances, you recall.

They enter the long-abandoned temple.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Fascinating! Original Akiviri bas-reliefs...almost entirely intact! Amazing...you can see how the Akiviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
They find the carved Wall up ahead.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall...so well preserved...I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akiviri sculptural relief...,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Yes, yes. Let's see what we have... Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim. Here, the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War. Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall. You see, here he is falling from the sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Patience, my dear. The Akiviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism. Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of Nord heroes -- this is the Akiviri symbol for ""Shout."" But...there's no way to know what Shout is meant.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
You mean they used a Shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself. Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it. Have you ever heard of such a thing? A Shout that can knock a dragon out of the sky?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"No, I've never heard of anything like that.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I was afraid you were going to say that. I guess there's nothing for it. We'll have to ask the Greybeards for help. I hoped to avoid involving them in all this, but we have no other choice.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
The Greybeards might know.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're probably right. I was hoping to avoid having to involve them in all this, but it seems we have no choice.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What do you have against the Greybeards?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If they had their way, you'd do nothing but sit up on their mountain with them and talk to the sky, or whatever it is they do. The Greybeards are so afraid of power they won't use it. Think about it. Have they tried to stop the civil war, or done anything about Alduin? No. And they're afraid of you, of your power. Trust me, there's no need to be afraid. Think of Tiber Septim. Do you think he'd have founded the Empire if he'd listened to the Greybeards?",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
The Greybeards may have a point. Power is dangerous.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Only if you don't know how to use it. All the great heroes have had to learn to use their power. Those that shrank from their destiny...well, you've never heard of them, have you? And there are the villains -- those that misused their power. There's always a choice, and there's always a risk. But if you live in fear of what might go wrong, you'll end up doing nothing. Like the Greybeards up on their mountain.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
Don't worry. I'm not afraid of my own power.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. The Greybeards can teach you a lot, but don't let them turn you away from your destiny. You're Dragonborn, and you're the only one who stop Alduin. Don't forget it.",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I'd better go see what Arngeir knows about this Shout.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"(same as ""I'll ask Arngeir if he knows what Shout they used"")",CHARACTER,Delphine,female
I'll ask Arngeir if he knows what Shout they used.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Right. Good thing they've already let you into their little cult. Not likely they'd help Esbern or me if we came calling. We'll look around Sky Haven Temple and see what else the old Blades might have left for us. It's a better hideout than we could have hoped for. Talos guard you.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
"Look, here. In the third panel. The prophecy that brought the Akiviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn. Here are the Akiviri -- the Blades -- you see their distinctive longswords. Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time. Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of your own history.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male

I'd like to learn the Shout used to defeat Alduin.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Where did you learn of that? Who have you been talking to?,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Does it matter?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. For matters of such gravity, we need to know where you stand. Or who you stand with.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Who I stand with is my business.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I have nothing to hide. The Blades helped me find out about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Blades! Of course. They specialize in meddling in matters they barely understand. Their reckless arrogance knows no bounds. They have always sought to turn the Dragonborn from the path of wisdom. Have you learned nothing from us? Would you simply be a tool in the hands of the Blades, to be used for their own purposes?",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
It was recorded on Alduin's Wall.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

The Blades are helping me. I'm not their puppet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, no, of course not. Forgive me, Dragonborn. I have been intemperate with you. But heed my warning -- the Blades may say they serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
So can you teach me this Shout?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"(skip down to ""No. I cannot teach..."" below)",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
The Blades just want to defeat Alduin. Don't you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What I want is irrelevant. This Shout was used once before, was it not? And here we are again. Have you considered that Alduin was not meant to be defeated? Those who overthrew him in ancient times only postponed the day of reckoning, they did not stop it. If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
At least the Blades aren't keeping secrets from me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Do not be so sure about that. Beware -- the Blades may claim to serve the Dragonborn, but they do not. They never have. As for me, I only kept from you what you were not yet ready to know. Are still not ready to know, as your question reveals.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male

Dragonborn...wait. Forgive me. I was...intemperate. I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Master Einarth reminded me of my duty. The decision whether or not to help you is not mine to make.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
The dialogue always ends with:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, you can teach me this Shout?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. I cannot teach it to you because I do not know it. It is called ""Dragonrend,"" but its Words of Power are unknown to us. We do not regret this loss. Dragonrend holds no place within the Way of the Voice.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I thought you knew all the Words of Power.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
But not Dragonrend. The knowledge of that Shout was lost in the time before history began. Perhaps only its creators ever knew it. But I am not the one to speak of it to you.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
What's so bad about Dragonrend?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It was created by those who had lived under the unimaginable cruelty of Alduin's Dragon Cult. Their whole lives were consumed with hatred for dragons, and they poured all their anger and hatred into this Shout. When you learn a Shout, you take it into your very being. In a sense, you become the Shout. In order to learn and use this Shout, you will be taking this evil into yourself.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"If the Shout is lost, how can I defeat Alduin?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Only Paarthurnax, the leader of our order, can answer that question, if he so chooses.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Who is Paarthurnax?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He is our leader. He surpasses us all in his mastery of the Way of the Voice.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Why haven't I met Paarthurnax yet?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He lives in seclusion on the very peak of the mountain. He speaks to us only rarely, and never to outsiders. Being allowed to see him is a great privilege.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"I need to speak to Paarthurnax, then.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You weren't ready. You still aren't ready. But thanks to the Blades, you now have questions that only Paarthurnax can answer.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male

You're the master of the Greybeards?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
They see me as master. Wuth. Onik. Old and wise. It is true I am old...,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I think you already know who I am.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I need to learn the Dragonrend Shout. Can you teach me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"Aaah...yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind. So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy task for a joor...mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood. What would you ask of me?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
Can you teach me the Dragonrend Shout?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ah. I have expected you. Prodah. You would not come all this way for tinvaak with an old dovah. No. You seek your weapon against Alduin.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
How did you know I came for Dragonrend?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Alduin komeyt tiid. What else would you seek? Alduin and Dovahkiin return together. But, I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
The Greybeards didn't want me to come at all.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hmm. Yes. They are very protective of me. Bahlaan fahdonne. But I do not know the Thu'um you seek. Krosis.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
Do you know Dragonrend or not?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Krosis. Sorrowfully, no. It cannot be known to me. Your kind -- joorre -- mortals -- created it as a weapon against the dov...the dragons. Our hadrimme, our minds cannot even...comprehend its concepts.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
"How can I learn it, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Drem. All in good time. First, a question for you. Why do you want to learn this Thu'um?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
That's none of your business.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Nid. If you wish me to answer your question, you must answer mine.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I need to stop Alduin.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Alduin...zeymah. The elder brother. Gifted, grasping and troublesome as is so often the case with firstborn. But why? Why must you stop Alduin?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
The prophecy says that only the Dragonborn can stop him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"True... But qostiid -- prophecy -- tells what may be, not what should be. Qostiid sahlo aak. Just because you can do a thing, does not always mean you should. Do you have no better reason for acting than destiny? Are you nothing but a plaything of dez...of fate?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I like this world. I don't want to see it end.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Pruzah. As good a reason as any. There are many who feel as you do, although not all. Some would say that all things must end, so that the next can come to pass. Perhaps this world is simply the Egg for the next kalpa? Lein vokiin? Would you stop the next world from being born?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I didn't come here to debate philosophy with you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hahaha! You have much to learn of the dov, then. There is nothing else but philosophy to a dovah. It is no accident that we do battle with our Thu'um, our Voices. There is no distinction between debate and combat to a dragon. Tinvaak los grah. For us it is one and the same.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
The next world will have to take care of itself.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Paaz. A fair answer. Ro fus...maybe you only balance the forces at work to quicken the end of this world. Even we who ride the currents of Time cannot see past Time's end. Wuldsetiid los tahrodiis. Those who try to hasten the end, may delay it. Those who work to delay the end, may bring it closer.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I don't believe in destiny. But I will stop Alduin.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And so, perhaps, your destiny will be fulfilled. Who can say? Dez motmahus. Even to the dov, who ride the currents of Time, destiny is elusive. Alduin believes that he will prevail, with good reason. Rok mul. And he is no fool. Ni mey, rinik gut nol. Far from it. He began as the wisest and most far-seeing of us all. But you have indulged my weakness for speech long enough. Krosis. Now I will answer your question. Do you know why I live here, at the peak o the Monahven -- what you name Throat of the World?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
"No. Dragons like mountains, right?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
True. But few now remember that this was the very spot where Alduin was defeated by the ancient Tongues. Vahrukt unslaad... perhaps none but me now remember how he was defeated.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I never thought about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world. Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
You said you were going to answer my question.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Drem. Patience. I am answering, in my way. This is the most sacred mountain in Skyrim. Zok revak strunmah. The great mountain of the world. Here the ancient Tongues, the first mortal masters of the Voice, brought Alduin to battle and defeated him.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
"Using the Dragonrend Shout, right?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes and no. Viik nuz ni kron. Alduin was not truly defeated, either. If he was, you would not be here today, seeking to... defeat him. The Nords of those days used the Dragonrend Shout to cripple Alduin. But this was not enough. Ok mulaag unslaad. It was the Kel -- the Elder Scroll. They used it to...cast him adrift on the currents of Time.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
An Elder Scroll? What's that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmm. How to explain in your tongue? The dov have words for such thing that joorre do not. It is an...artifact from outside time. It does not exist, but it has always existed. Rah wahlaan. They are...hmm...fragments of creation. The Kelle...Elder Scrolls, as you name them, they have often been used for prophecy. Yes, your prophecy comes from an Elder Scroll. But this is only a small part of their power. Zofaas suleyk.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
Are you saying the ancient Nords sent Alduin forward in time?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not intentionally. Some hoped he would be gone forever, forever lost. Meyye. I knew better. Tiid bo amativ. Time flows ever onward. One day he would surface. Which is why I have lived here. For thousands of mortal years I have waited. I knew where he would emerge but not when.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
How does any of this help me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Tiid krent. Time was...shattered here because of what the ancient Nords did to Alduin. If you brought that Kel, that Elder Scroll back here...to the Tiid-Ahraan, the Time-Wound... With the Elder Scroll that was used to break Time, you may be able to...cast yourself back. To the other end of the break. You could learn Dragonrend from those who created it.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
Do you know where I can find an Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Krosis. No. I know little of what has passed below in the long years I have lived here. You are likely better informed than I.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
The Lorekeeper at the College of Winterhold might know.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
One can inquire further to Paarthurnax on Alduin's circumstances.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What do I do with the Elder Scroll when I find it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Return it here, to the Tiid-Ahraan. Then... Kelle vomindok. Nothing is certain with such things. But I believe the Scroll's bond with the Tiid-Ahraan will allow you a...a seeing, a vision of the moment of its creation. Then you will feel -- know -- Dragonrend, in the power of its first expression. You will see them...wuth fadonne...my friends -- Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
"Hakon, Gormlaith, Felldir? Who are they?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The first mortals that I taught the Thu'um -- the first Tongues. The leaders of the rebellion against Alduin. They were mighty, in their day. Even to attempt to defeat Alduin...sahrot hunne. The Nords have had many heroes since, but none greater.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
How could an Elder Scroll cast Alduin through time?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Vomindok. I do not know. Perhaps in the very doing they erased the knowing of it from Time itself. The dov are children of Akatosh. Thus we are specially...attuned to the flow of Time. Perhaps also uniquely vulnerable. I warned them against such a rash action. Even I could not foresee its consequences. Nust ni hon. They would not listen.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
You mean you were there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Yes. There were a few of us that rebelled against Alduin's thur... his tyranny. We aided the humans in his overthrow. But they did not trust us. Ni ov. Their inner councils were kept hidden from us. I was far from here on the day of Alduin's downfall. But all dov felt the...sundering of Time itself.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
What does the Dragonrend Shout actually do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I cannot tell you in detail. I never heard it used. Kogaan. It was the first Thu'um created solely by mortals. It was said to force a dragon to experience the concept of Mortality. A truly vonmindoraan...incomprehensible idea to the immortal dov.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
"Optionally, one can ask Arngeir about the Scroll.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So...you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you. Did he tell you what you wanted to know? Did he teach you the Dragonrend Shout?,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"No, but he told me how to find out.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
So be it. If he believes it is necessary for you to learn this...we will bow to his wisdom.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I need the Elder Scroll the ancients used. Do you know where to find it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We have never concerned ourselves with the Scrolls. The gods themselves would rightly fear to tamper with such things. As for where to find it...such blasphemies have always been the stock and trade of the mages of Winterhold. They may be able to tell you something about the Elder Scroll you seek.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
One journeys to the College's librarian.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm looking for an Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about, or are you just someone's errand boy?",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Tell me more about the Elder Scrolls.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions. An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power. To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness. Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
A price for what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The simplest way to put it is ""knowledge,"" but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll. It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts. Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading. But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Who wrote the Elder Scrolls?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense. The Scrolls exist here, with us, but are also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them. Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
All right. So do you have one that I could use?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ha!,CHARACTER,Urag,male
Of course I do. Do you have one here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You think even if I did have one here, I would let you see it? It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
What about the Dragonborn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What about...wait. Are you? Were you the one the Greybeards were calling? I'll bring everything we have on them, but it's not much.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Do you at least have any information on them?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course.,CHARACTER,Urag,male
I need to find one and was told you could help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books. I'll bring everything we have on them, but it's not much. So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.",CHARACTER,Urag,male

"This ""Ruminations"" book is incomprehensible.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Where did he go?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Somewhere up north, in the ice fields. Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but...well, that was years ago. Haven't heard from him since.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
He's dead?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close. Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try and find him.",CHARACTER,Urag,male

If one seeks out Arngeir instead of the other two:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Alduin...we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here...you defeated him?,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"Yes, but he escaped. I need to find out where he went.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The old tales say that he is able to travel into Sovngarde to devour the souls of the dead. But they don't say how he does this.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
One of his dragon allies could tell us...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, of course! But how to force a dragon to talk to you... There is one possibility. But...no, the Jarl would never agree.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
The Jarl? What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Do you know Dragonsreach? The Jarl of Whiterun's palace? Its name is no accident. The palace was originally built to hold a captive dragon.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
But I thought there weren't any dragons until Alduin came back.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, this was back in the days of Olaf One-Eye, thousands of years ago. In those days, dragons could still be found among the remote mountain peaks. Before the Blades wiped them all out.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
So if I could lure a dragon into Dragonsreach...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You might be able to trap him there, exactly. You'd require the Jarl's cooperation, of course. That might not be easy to come by. You must trust in the rightness of your cause, and the strength of your Voice.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
If one speaks to Esbern instead of the other two:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did you find the Elder Scroll? What happened when you took it back to the Throat of the World?,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"I defeated Alduin, but he escaped. I need to find him.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He must have returned to Sovngarde to feed on the souls of the dead. If you don't find him soon, he'll return, stronger than ever!",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
I know. That's why I need to find him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, yes. We must think. He must have a means of travelling to and from Sovngarde. But no tale tells where that might be.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
His dragon allies must know where this portal is...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Very true! Hmmm. I wonder...do you know the Jarl's palace in Whiterun?,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
You mean Dragonsreach?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, exactly! Most people don't know that it was originally built to hold a captive dragon -- hence its name.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
What's the Jarl's palace have to do with this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, you see, the palace -- Dragonsreach -- was originally built to hold a captive dragon. Hence its name.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
I thought there weren't any dragons until Alduin came back.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, this was thousands of years ago, before the Akiviri crusaders cleansed Skyrim of dragons. Skyrim's mountains were still infested with dragons. One of the early Nord kings caught a dragon and kept it in Dragonsreach.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
So if I could lure a dragon into Dragonsreach...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You could trap him there, exactly. Although...it might be difficult to persuade the Jarl to allow you to use his palace as a dragon trap... I'm sure you'll manage, though. If you can defeat the World-Eater, surely sweet-talking the Jarl of Whiterun isn't beyond you. I'm afraid there's a further problem. A serious one. I've discovered who the Greybeards' leader really is.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
You've discovered...what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of Alduin, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
Turns out he's a dragon. But he helped me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All well and good. But did you know that he was Alduin's chief lieutenant in ancient times? Responsible for terrible atrocities? It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years. The Blades have been hunting him for centuries, but he was protected by the Greybeards and then the Emperors. Justice demands that he die for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a Blade prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"After getting info on Whiterun, one seeks out the Jarl.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I need your help. I need to trap a dragon in your palace.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I must have misheard you. I thought you asked me to help you trap a dragon in my palace.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. You already saved Whiterun from that dragon. I owe you a great deal. But I don't understand. Why let a dragon into the heart of my city when we've been working so hard to keep them out?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
You heard right. It's the only way to stop the dragons.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What you're asking for is insane. Impossible!,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"• You want me to let a dragon into the heart of the city, with the threat of war on my doorstep? • Why would I agree to let a dragon into the heart of my city, after working so hard to keep them out?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The threat is worse than you know. Alduin has returned.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Alduin? The World-Eater himself? But...how can we fight him? Doesn't his return mean it's the end times?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
It's only hopeless if we give up.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I didn't say anything about giving up.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
I'm Dragonborn. It's my destiny to stop him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't know about such things, but I heard the Greybeards summon you. That's good enough for me.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Maybe so, but I plan to go down fighting. What about you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Spoken like a true Nord. I'll stand beside you, Dragonborn. Now, what's this nonsense about trapping a dragon in my palace?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
It's the only way to find Alduin before it's too late.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"• Then...Whiterun will stand with you, Dragonborn. We will take the risk, whether it be in victory or defeat! • I want to help you, Dragonborn. And I will. But I need your help first. Ulfric and General Tullius are both just waiting for me to make a wrong move. Do you think they will sit idle a dragon is slaughtering my men and burning my city? No. I can't risk weakening the city while we are under the threat of enemy attack. I'm sorry.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
If the civil war has ended:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So what's the plan, then? How do you intend to lure a dragon into the trap?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
I don't know yet. But I know some people who can probably help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh...well, I'll leave that to you. I trust you know your business. Probably for the best. It will give me time to see if that old trap still works -- and break the news to the men.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
If the civil war is ongoing:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What if you didn't have to worry about an enemy attack?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then I would be glad to help you with your mad dragon-trapping scheme. But getting both sides to agree to a truce will be difficult at this point. The bitterness has gone too deep. Maybe...hmm...what of the Greybeards? They are respected by all Nords. High Hrothgar is neutral territory. If the Greybeards are willing to host a peace council...then maybe Ulfric and Tullius would have to listen.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Leave that to me. I'll talk to Arngeir about hosting a peace council.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, Dragonborn. Maybe you can stop the dragons -- and this war into the bargain.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"If one hasn't learned the Shout needed during ""Season Unending,"" this can be gotten from Paarthurnax at the Throat:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I need a way to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach. Any ideas?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmm, yes. I have been pondering on exactly that question. Lingrah morah. I have tasted the voices of Alduin's allies on the wind. Pogaan nahlaas, vokrii wah jun. There is one who I remember well. Odahviing. He is the one to tell us where Alduin has gone.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
So we know his name. How does that help me get him to Dragonsreach?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, I forget how little you know of the dov. Our names are always made of us three Rotmulaag -- Words of Power. You see -- Paar-thur-nax -- a Thu'um -- a Shout, yes?",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
Why would he come when called?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He is not compelled to come, but the dov are prideful by nature. Few could resist such a challenge. Especially from you, Dovahkiin. But Odahviing, he is...headstrong? Boziik. Rash. Even among the dov, he was known for this. He will not resist the challenge of your Voice, Dovahkiin. He will come. Now -- hear his name. Odahviing. Taste it on the wind. Od-ah-viing.

I need a way to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach. Any ideas?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Interesting problem. Hmmm. Yes. I've been poring over the records here in Sky Haven Temple. An unguessed trove of lost lore...but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew. Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
How does that help us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts. By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
Why would he come when called?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge. Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin. I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
So what's this dragon's name?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll. Od - Ah - Viing. ""Winged Snow Hunter,"" as I read it.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male

Not quite yet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

None were yet ready to openly defy him.",CHARACTER,Odahviing,male
You were telling me where to find Alduin?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Unslaad krosis. Innumerable pardons. I digress. He has travelled to Sovngarde to regain his strength, devouring the sillesejoor...the souls of the mortal dead. A privilege he jealously guards... His door to Sovngarde is at Skuldafn, one of his ancient fanes high in the eastern mountains. Mindoraan, pah ok middovahhe lahvraan til.

Ah. Well. Hmm...krosis. There is one...detail about Skuldafn I neglected to mention.,CHARACTER,Odahviing,male

We are not warriors. What is overlooked in the Dragonborn is not permitted to any other followers or the Way of the Voice.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I'll worry about capturing a dragon. I need your help to stop the war.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You misunderstand our authority. The Greybeards have never involved themselves in political affairs.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Jarl Balgruuf won't help me while the war rages.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Both sides respect the Greybeards. They will listen.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Now you see why I warned you against them! Bloodthirsty barbarians!,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Is it true what they said? Was he Alduin's ally?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. But understand -- during the days of Alduin's rule, all dragons were his allies. There was nothing else they could be. If not for Paarthurnax, Alduin could not have been overthrown. It was he who first taught men to use the Thu'um.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
He still needs to pay for his crimes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The same could be said for any of us, could it not? Are you so guiltless as to stand in judgment upon Paarthurnax? Listen to your inner Voice before acting. Do not allow the Blades to bully you into doing something you will later regret. After all, repentance is something you deny to Paarthurnax by meting out your so-called justice.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I haven't decided what to do yet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

They're convening a peace council at High Hrothgar.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's nothing to discuss as long as that traitor Ulfric is in arms against his rightful Emperor.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
We need a truce until the dragon menace is dealt with.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They are getting to be a problem. But I wasn't sent to Skyrim to fight dragons. My job is to quell this rebellion, and I intend to do just that, dragons or no dragons.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The dragons are a bigger problem than the Stormcloaks right now. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You may have a point. It's getting difficult to even move troops around without attracting a dragon attack. By all accounts the Stormcloaks are suffering just as badly. Even Ulfric might see the sense of a truce under these conditions.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"I'll be the judge of that. Besides, by all reports the Stormcloaks are suffering just as much a we are from these dragon attacks.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The best time to negotiate is from a position of strength.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fair enough. We're driving the Stormcloaks back well enough at the moment, but we're already overstretched. That's what comes from trying to win a war with bare handful of legions. If the Emperor would just give me the reinforcements I've requested!",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Why won't the Emperor send more reinforcements?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Most of the Legion is tied down on the border with the Aldmeri Dominion. The Emperor can't afford to risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses. From the Imperial City, our war here is just a sideshow. An interlude before the main event against the Thalmor resumes.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The Empire can't afford to snub the Greybeards.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hmm. You may have a point. I'm always surprised by how seriously the Nords take these things.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"You'll come to the peace council, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Yes, fine, I'll come to this Greybeard council. For all the good it will do.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The player visits Ulfric's Palace of the Kings in Windhelm.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have a message from the Greybeards.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's about time they turned their gaze from the heavens, back to our bleeding homeland. What do they want?",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
They want to negotiate a truce until the dragon menace is dealt with.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have the greatest respect for the Greybeards, of course. And the dragon attacks are a growing plague. But the political situation is still delicate. Not all the Jarls are fully committed to supporting me as High King. I can't afford to appear weak. I can't agree to this unless Tullius himself will be there.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Politics be damned! Alduin has returned! (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Alduin? The World-Eater of song and legend? If that's true...well, it changes the situation doesn't it? Even Tullius may be forced to talk sense in the face of such a threat.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
General Tullius has already agreed to attend.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. We still hold half of Skyrim despite everything the Empire could throw at us. I doubt the Empire has the stomach for much more bloodletting.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
So you'll come to the peace council?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Yes. I'll give Tullius one more chance to quit Skyrim with his tail between his legs.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"With the two players collected, one returns to Arngeir in the main hall.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, you've done it. The men of violence are gathered here, in these halls whose very stones are dedicated to peace. I should not have agreed to host this council. The Greybeards have no business involving ourselves in such matters.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
Don't worry. I'll get them to agree to peace.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Peace? I doubt it. They may put their weapons down for a moment, but only to gather strength for the next bloodletting. They are not yet tired of war. Far from it. Do you know the ancient Nord word for war? ""Season unending""...so it has proved.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
This was the only way to get Balgruuf's help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, yes. Which is why I allowed this...violation of all our traditions. But regrets are pointless. Here we are. Take your seat at the council table and let us see what wisdom we can find among these warriors of Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"In the adjacent chamber, Skyrim's big shots are gathered: Tullius and Rikke, summit begins:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
And so we meet again. But this time I know who and what you really are.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
I'll give you credit for boldness. But associating yourself with the Blades is a choice you will come to regret.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
I'm here to ensure General Tullius does not exceed his authority.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
We should get started.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
"If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
We should get started.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Is everyone here? Let's get this started.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
I'm here because it's requested of me. But there's nothing to be gained by talking to that murderer.,CHARACTER,Elisif,female
"I understand this council was your idea, Dragonborn. I'm afraid I don't hold out much hope for success.",CHARACTER,Elisif,female
I'm glad I finally got a chance to see this place.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
When has any good ever come from talking to the Empire?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"I don't know how you convinced Ulfric to talk to the Empire. Worse than a waste of time, if you ask me.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I never thought I'd willingly stand in the same room with Tullius again. At least not without a weapon in my hand.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
It's good to be back at High Hrothgar after all these years.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I'd just as soon get this over with.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
We should get started. Alduin is only getting stronger.,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
What are we waiting for?,CHARACTER,Delphine,female
We must succeed here today.,CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"We must make them see their danger, Dragonborn.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
"Eventually, Arngeir calls for everyone's attention.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now that everyone is here, please take your seats so we can begin. I hope that we have all come here in the spirit of...",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
No. You insult us by bringing her to this negotiation? Your chief Talos-hunter?,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
That didn't take long.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"Hear, hear!",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I have every right to be at this negotiation. I need to ensure that nothing is agreed to here that violates the terms of the White-Gold Concordat.,CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
She's part of the Imperial deligation. You can't dictate who I bring to this council.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"Please. If we have to negotiate the terms of the negotiation, we will never get anywhere. Perhaps this would be a good time to get the Dragonborn's input on this matter.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"By Ysmir's beard, the nerve of those Imperial bastards, eh? To think that I would sit down at the same table with that...Thalmor bitch. Either she walks or I do.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
You're right. The Thalmor have no business here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm glad we agree on this.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"What's the harm? Besides, Tullius doesn't really want her here either.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maybe so, but bringing her here is a deliberate provocation. Tullius needs to know I won't be pushed around.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I agree. This will set the tone for the whole negotiation. Elenwen should go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Well said.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Let Tullius have his way on this. He'll have to give ground later.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmm. It feels like a mistake to me, but I'll bow to your judgment on this.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
If Elenwen gets to stay:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"But she is to observe, nothing more. We are not negotiating with her, is that clear?",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Ulfric, why so hostile? After all, it's not the Thalmor that are burning your farms and killing your sons.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
She's supposed to be on our side?,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
You know exactly...no. Not this time.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
If Elenwen leaves:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Very well, Ulfric. Enjoy your petty victory. The Thalmor will treat with whatever government rules Skyrim. We would not think of interfering in your civil war.",CHARACTER,Elenwen,female
Ha! Skyrim will never bow to the Thalmor! Unlike your Imperial friends here.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"You're lucky I respect the Greybeards' council, Galmar!",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Legate. We represent the Emperor here.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
After the Elenwen issue is decided:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now that that's settled, may we proceed?",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
I have something to say first.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Here we go.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"The only reason I agreed to attend this council was to deal with the dragon menace. There's nothing else to talk about, unless the Empire is finally ready to renounce its unjust claim to rule over the free people of Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
We're here to offer a temporary truce to allow the Dragonborn here to deal with the dragons. Nothing more. I consider even talking to the Empire a generous gesture.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Are you done? Did you just come here to make speeches? Or can we get down to business?,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"Yes, let's get this over with.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Are we ready to proceed? Jarl Ulfric. General Tullius. This council is unprecedented. We are gathered here at the Dragonborn's request. I ask that you all respect the spirit of High Hrothgar, and do your best to begin the process of achieving a lasting peace in Skyrim. Who would like to open the negotiations?",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"Yes, let's get down to it. We want control of Markarth. That's our price for agreeing to a truce.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"So that's why you're here, Ulfric? You dare to insult the Greybeards by using this council to advance your own position?",CHARACTER,Elisif,female
"Jarl Elisif, I'll handle this.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"General, this is outrageous! You can't be taking this demand seriously! I thought we were here to discuss the truce!",CHARACTER,Elisif,female
"Elisif! I said I'd handle it. Ulfric, you can't seriously expect us to give up Markarth at the negotiating table. You hope to gain in council what you've been unable to take in battle, is that it?",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
I'm sure Jarl Ulfric does not expect something for nothing.,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"Yes, that'd be entirely out of character.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
What would the Empire want in return?,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"Wait. General, you don't intend to just hand over Markarth to that... traitor!",CHARACTER,Elisif,female
This is how the Empire repays us for our loyalty?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Enough! First, let's be clear. This council wasn't my idea. I think it's a waste of time. You are a traitor to the Empire, and deserve a traitor's death. But I at least will negotiate in good faith. Since we're all here at your request, I'd like to hear what you think Markarth is worth.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
How about Riften?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmm. The Rift would help secure our communications with Cyrodiil... and threaten Ulfric's southern flank... You heard the man, Ulfric. We've made you a fair offer. Are you serious about these talks, or are you just here to posture?",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Winterhold seems like a fair trade.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In exchange for Markarth, the source of most of Skyrim's silver? Hardly. Riften seems like a better choice to me. Well-fortified, easily resupplied across Lake Honrich. Plus all the mead we can drink.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
You asked my opinion. I gave it to you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fair enough. I was hoping you could put aside your loyalties for the greater good, but I see you're firmly in Ulfric's camp. Still... Winterhold would allow us to directly threaten the rebel supply lines out of Windhelm... Better than nothing, I suppose. But Ulfric will need to offer a lot more if he wants me to give up Markarth without a fight.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
There are advantages to gaining Winterhold. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"(""Winterhold would allow..."" to ""...Markarth without a fight."")",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"Not enough to outweigh the loss of Markarth. With the Reach in enemy hands, our whole position in Solitude would be threatened.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
You're right. Riften is a fair trade for Markarth.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm glad you agree. I was starting to wonder whose side you were on here.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
If one traded Winterhold:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The Dragonborn has spoken, Tullius. Markarth will be ours. Now we'll see if there's anything behind your talk of good faith.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"• I don't blame you, Dragonborn. You made the best of a bad situation. But I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all. • You disappoint me, Dragonborn. I accepted your invitation on trust in your good name. But it seems you intend to favor Ulfric. I can see now that this is not a negotiation at all. I know you, Ulfric. If I hand over Markarth, you'll be ready with a new demand. You'll never defeat the Empire, and you know it. But you're willing to sacrifice thousands for your own selfish ambition. Soon enough I'll have you back under the headsman's axe, and this time there won't be any dragon to save you.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"As always, the Empire's fine words are worth nothing!",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
If one traded Riften:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I expected better from you, Dragonborn. I came here in good faith, and now it seems you help the Empire at every turn. As for you General Tullius, I see now that Galmar was right. Talking to the Empire is just as useless as ever. If you think you can hold Markarth, you're as deluded as your Emperor when he signed away our freedom to the Thalmor. Skyrim will never again bow to your false Empire! Let's go, Galmar. I should have listened to you in the first place.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male

Ulfric should compensate you for Karthwasten.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well said. For once, you'll actually pay for your crimes.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Who's to say what happened at Karthwasten?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I should have known better than to expect you to give us a fair hearing. Once again, the Empire takes the blame for the crimes of others.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"If the Dragonborn decides, but the terms still aren't fair:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You know I can't agree to these terms. The Emperor would repudiate this treaty and I would be recalled.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male

I agree. Ulfric should turn over the Pale.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Arngeir will say applicable bullet points next:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"It seems we may have an agreement. Jarl Ulfric... General Tullius... These are the terms currently on the table. • Markarth will be handed over to Ulfric's forces. Jarl Igmund will step down, and Thongvor Silver-Blood will become the Jarl of Markarth. • Ulfric will allow Imperial troops to enter Winterhold. Korir will replace Kraldar as Jarl. • The Stormcloaks will withdraw from the rift, allowing Imperial troops unhindered access. Jarl Laila Law-Giver will step down, and Maven Black-Briar will become the Jarl of Riften. • The Stormcloaks will pay appropriate compensation for the massacre at Karthwasten. • Hjaalmarch will be turned over to Ulfric, with Sori the Builder assuming the Jarlship. • The Pale will be turned over to the Empire. Brina Merilis will assume the Jarlship in Dawnstar.",CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
You both agree to this?,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"• The sons of Skyrim will live up to their agreements. As long as the Imperials hold to theirs. What about you, Elisif? Are these terms to your liking? Speak up. I'm sure General Tullius is waiting to do your bidding. • I shouldn't agree to terms that so blatantly favor the Empire. I have no choice, though, under the circumstances. But once Alduin is defeated, then it will be the Empire's turn. Remember ""Evgir Unslaad."" You should be pleased, Elisif. You've done so well for yourself as the Empire's pet Jarl. But beware -- the Empire's loyalty is fickle. They will tire of this war, and then I will be the one dictating terms to you.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"I have nothing to say to that murderer. General, you've proven yourself a good friend to Skyrim. I continue to trust that you will do your utmost to safeguard our interests.",CHARACTER,Elisif,female
"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. I appreciate your loyalty. • The Empire can live with these terms, yes. For a temporary truce, until the dragon menace is dealt with. • These terms blatantly favor the rebels. Everyone here knows that. But the Empire will accept them, until the dragon menace is dealt with. After that, Ulfric...there will be a reckoning. Count on it.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"No matter the negotiations, Ulfric and Galmar start leaving at this point.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Come on, Galmar. We've have a lot of work to do.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male

"Yes, I'm ready to do my part. Just say the word, and my men will help you spring this trap.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
But the difficulty remains -- how to lure a dragon to Dragonsreach at all?,CHARACTER,Arngeir,male
"Well, that's an excellent question. You haven't overlooked that little detail, did you?",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"Ah. I believe I can be of help here. I anticipated this problem. While you were arranging this meeting, I was busy in the library of Sky Haven Temple. An unguessed trove of lost lore...but the important thing is that the Blades recorded many of the names of dragons they slew. Cross-referencing this with Delphine's map of dragon burial sites, and I believe I've identified one of the dragons that Alduin has raised up.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
How does that help us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, don't you see? The names of dragons are always three Words of Power -- Shouts. By calling the dragon with the Voice, he will hear you wherever he might be.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
Why would he come when called?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He's not compelled to, but dragons are prideful by nature and loath to refuse a challenge. Your Voice in particular is likely to intrigue this dragon, after your victory over Alduin. I think it very likely that he will be unable to resist investigating your call.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male
So what's this dragon's name?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, indeed. I'm no master of the Voice like these worthy gentlemen, but it is written here in this scroll. Od - Ah - Viing. ""Winged Snow Hunter,"" as I read it.",CHARACTER,Esbern,male

That could have gone worse. Now it's up to you to deliver.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male

"Happy? No, I am not happy. Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu. Alduin was once the crown of our father Akatosh's creation. You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok -- the arrogance of his power.",CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I have no regrets. Alduin had to be destroyed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. Alduin wahlaan daanii. I would not have helped you if I thought otherwise. You did what was necessary. Alduin had flown far from the path of right action in his pahlok -- the arrogance of his power.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
Alduin brought this on himself.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Indeed. Alduin wahlaan daanii. His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu -- our father Akatosh. But I cannot celebrate his fall. Zu'u tiiraaz ahst ok mah. He was my brother once. This world will never be the same.,CHARACTER,Paarthurnax,male
I was just fulfilling my destiny as Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I hope so. But I don't know if Alduin can ever be completely destroyed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Perhaps, perhaps not. Dragons are not like mortal creatures, and Alduin is unique even among dragonkind. He may be permitted to return at the end of time to fulfill his destiny as the World-Eater. But that is for the gods to decide. You have done your part. You've shown yourself mighty, both in Voice and deed. In order to defeat Alduin, you've gained mastery of dreadful weapons. Now it is up to you to decide what to do with your power and skill. Will you be a hero whose name is remembered in song throughout the ages? Or will your name be a curse to future generations? Or will your memory fade from history, unremembered? Let the Way of the Voice be your guide, and the path of wisdom will be clear to you. Breath and focus, Dragonborn.

What is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, forgive me. Most who arrive here do so because they have heard of the College beforehand. This is the College of Winterhold, a safe haven for mages in Skyrim. A place of wisdom and arcane knowledge.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Why are you out here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am here to assist those seeking the wisdom of the College. And if, in the process, my presence helps to deter those who might seek to do harm, so be it. The more important question is: why are you here?",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
May I enter the College?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Perhaps. But what is it you expect to find within?,CHARACTER,Faralda,female
I want to use the power of fire and ice to destroy any who oppose me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see. That power certainly exists, I assure you. Wield it faithfully, and few can withstand you.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
I desire to bend the will of those around me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, the school of Illusion can be quite influential. Kings have risen to power because of it, and empires have been razed with it.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
I want to unravel the mysteries of Aetherius.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, the immortal plane. It is said to be the source of all magic. This is a noble goal, indeed.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
I just wanted to see what it looks like inside.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha! Humor is often in short supply here. But I sense that perhaps you're after more than just that. It would seem that the College has what you seek. The question now is what can you offer for the College. Not just anyone is allowed inside. Those wishing to enter must show some degree of skill with magic. A small test, if you will.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female

Where do I need to go again?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'll need to speak with Mirabelle Ervine. Her quarters are in the Hall of Countenance, but she could be anywhere on the grounds.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Who is Mirabelle Ervine?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She's the Master-Wizard here. Arch-Mage Eren may be in charge, but Mirabelle runs the place. You'd do well to remember that.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
I'd like to know more about the College.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We are the only group left in Skyrim dedicated to study of the arcane. There are those who study, to be sure, but they do so in private, and often in secret.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Is there any advice you can give about Destruction spells?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Certainly. Destruction spells come in different forms, each useful for various purposes. Concentration spells can be cast immediately, though they're weaker. Good for a tight spot, and less costly if you miss. You'll also need to decide whether to devote yourself to a single type of spell. Focusing solely on flame spells will make them more powerful, but you may find yourself at a disadvantage against foes immune to fire.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
The destruction teacher leads one into the College grounds. Mirabelle Ervine is talking with a Thalmor agent near the door.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I believe I've made myself rather clear.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"Yes, of course. I'm simply trying to understand the reasoning behind the decision.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"You may be used to the Empire bowing to your every whim, but I'm afraid you'll find the Thalmor receive no such treatment here. You are a guest of the College, here at the pleasure of the Arch-Mage. I hope you appreciate the opportunity.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"Yes, of course. The Arch-Mage has my thanks.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Very good. Then we're done here.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
The player walks over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Welcome to the College.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
I was told to come see you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Another new student...I'm surprised at how many of you there are lately. Well, first you'll need these. While you're not required to wear them, you may find them more to your liking than your current clothes. I'll give you a brief tour, and then we'll get you to your first class. Are you ready to begin?",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
I'd love to have a look around.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Wonderful. Please follow me, and don't wander off.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"Sorry, I'm not ready for that just yet.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see. Well, please let me know when you are.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
The player takes the grand tour.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The College of Winterhold has been a fixture in Skyrim for thousands of years. The prominent feature here is the Hall of the Elements. It's our primary location for lectures, practice sessions, and general meetings. The Arcanaeum is located above the hall, and the Arch-Mage's quarters above that. While technically in charge of the College, the Arch-Mage's responsibilities often keep him occupied. Thus, I run the day-to-day operations. Now, if you'll please follow me, I'll show you to the living quarters. Unfortunately, we've had to implement more stringent entry procedures, due to some problems with the local Nords. We don't anticipate any real violence, but it never hurts to be prepared. Our newest members are housed here at the Hall of Attainment. I'll ask that you please keep your voice down while inside, as others may be working on research or...delicate experiments. Now, I'll show you to your quarters. You're going to be sharing space with your fellow Apprentices, who you'll meet shortly. This is where you'll be staying. This bed and desk are yours. Please try and be considerate of others. Now, let's go back to the Hall of the Elements, where most of the members gather for lectures and study sessions. Initially, you'll be learning from Tolfdir, one of our most esteemed Wizards. Tolfdir is likely already addressing the new Apprentices. Go on in, and if you have any problems, let one of our senior members know.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
The player can inquire further about things.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's expected of me here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There are no expectations. The College is a place to study and practice magic freely. Hopefully any discoveries made in your pursuits will be shared with members of the College first. That way we all benefit.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Where can I learn new spells?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, that depends on what you're looking for. Faralda can teach Destruction spells, and offers training in that school. Phinis is one of the best Conjurers in all Skyrim, and can help with spells from that school. Don't let Tolfdir fool you; he's the pre-eminent scholar in Alteration. One of the best in Tamriel, and always willing to pass on his knowledge. If you can find him and focus his attention, there's a great deal Drevis can teach you about Illusion magic. And finally, there's Colette. She may be...difficult to get along with, but she's very knowledgeable when it comes to Restoration magic.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"The player enters the Hall of the Elements and finds Tolfdir with the other rookies: Onmund, J'zargo, and Brelyna Maryon.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen. So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous. Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!",CHARACTER,Brelyna,female
"Of course, my dear. Of course. You all possess some inherent magical ability. That much is not being questioned. What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!,CHARACTER,J'zargo,male
"Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?,CHARACTER,Onmund,male
You've been quiet so far. What do you think we should do?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I'm not really sure what to think.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not going to weigh in either way? I admire your restraint, but there are times when you must make decisions, even without all the facts. Rely on instinct. Onmund: We're all pretty new at this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I think we should learn something practical.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Is that so? Brelyna: See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Safety should be more important than anything.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, your classmates certainly seem to disagree with you. J'zargo: Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right? Would you mind helping me with the demonstration? Are you at all familiar with ward spells?",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I don't know any ward spells.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's all right. I can teach you a very basic ward, one that's enough for the purposes of this lesson.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"I have a ward spell, but I've never really used it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's what this lesson is for. Perfect time to try it out.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"I already know it, and already know how to use it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, then this should be no problem at all for you. Now, if you'll just stand right over there, I'll cast a spell at you, and you block it with the ward. Here we go. Over there, please. Just opposite me. Wouldn't want anyone else in the way. Now, cast the ward spell, and keep it up. You'll have to keep your ward up, or else this won't work. I don't want to hurt you. Hold still...",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The player blocks the fireball.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Excellent work! Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please. I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history. The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity. I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The player travels to Saarthan in the west Winterhold mountains. The rest of the Apprentices are waiting with Tolfdir.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
And here we all are. Shall we step inside?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I'm ready. Let's go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right, please stay close to me while we're inside. It should be safe, but it's always better to be cautious.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
What's so important about this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We're particularly interested in the prevalence of magical seals placed on the tombs here. It's rather unlike anything we've encountered.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
What are we looking for?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Anything! Anything at all that might be of interest. That's why I adore this location...we have no idea what we're going to find. And if, along the way, my message about the dangers of magic should happen to sink in for a few students, that would be a happy coincidence.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I'm not quite ready to go inside yet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No? I daresay we don't have all day.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"Sorry, I'm still not ready to go in there.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Still? If I have to wait much longer, you may need to just bury me here.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The students enter the barrow excavation site.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"As some of you may know, Saarthal was one of the earliest Nord settlements in Skyrim. It was also the largest. Sacked by the Elves in the infamous ""Night of Tears,"" not much is known about what happened to Saarthal. This is an exciting opportunity for us. To be able to study such an early civilization, and the magics they used... Well, are there any questions before we begin?",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I don't have any more questions. What would you like me to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, yes. Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist Arniel Gane? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds. I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins. Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Now what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, are there any questions before we begin? Now, let's see. What shall we have the rest of you do? Brelyna, my dear. Why don't you search for warding magics? Anything designed to keep people out. Don't interact with them, just identify them. All right, everyone. Onmund, please search that area over there. See if you notice any...residual energies. Alive or undead. J'zargo...what shall we have you do... Ah! Why don't you verify that we're the first ones here? Look for any amount of tampering with the tombs. All right, everyone. Let's be careful, but have fun! Let's be careful, but have fun!",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The others may comment on their journey so far.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm not seeing any signs of warding magics at all. Either they're not here, or they were removed long ago.",CHARACTER,Brelyna,female
"To think, my ancestors destroyed the homes of Onmund's ancestors. So much bloodshed.",CHARACTER,Brelyna,female
J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.,CHARACTER,J'zargo,male
Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?,CHARACTER,J'zargo,male
"Can you imagine what it was like, living here so long ago? The first men in Tamriel, here...",CHARACTER,Onmund,male
I wonder if everyone else would be so happy to rifle through the bones of their ancestors.,CHARACTER,Onmund,male
Please be careful here. The site isn't entirely secured.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"The player finds Arniel Gane far below, hunched over a desk.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Don't touch anything!,CHARACTER,Arniel,male
Tolfdir told me to help you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? Ah, yes. You. I remember you. You're going to help? That's fine. Just... Just don't make a mess of my work. I've only looked through a portion of this section. You, uh, you can look around in the chambers just north of here. Try and be careful, all right? We don't want to damage anything.",CHARACTER,Arniel,male
What did you need me to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Just round up the rest of the magical artifacts so that I can catalog them.,CHARACTER,Arniel,male
"The player goes into the nearby tombs, picking up enchanted accessories that drops a gate, trapping one inside.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What in the world was that racket? Is everything all right?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I'm trapped in here!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
How in the world did that happen?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I pulled an amulet off the wall.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? Perhaps the amulet is important somehow. Is there some way you can use it?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The player puts it on. A strange red aura leaks from the amulet's niche.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Do you see that? Some kind of resonance...you and the wall. It must be connected to the amulet! I wonder...what effect might your spells have?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Hitting the niche with a spell breaks the wall and lowers the trap.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did you see that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well would you look at that! This appears to lead somewhere. Let's see where it goes. Well, this is highly unusual. And very interesting. Why in the world would this be sealed off? What is this place? I'm not sure what to expect here. Please be on your guard.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"They traverse the secret tunnel. As Tolfdir is giving his cautious speech, a for the duration.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Know that you have set in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped. Judgment has not been passed, as you had no way of knowing. Judgment will be passed on your actions to come, and how you deal with the dangers ahead of you. This warning is passed to you because the Psijic Order believes in you. You, mage, and you alone, have the potential to prevent disaster. Take great care, and know that the Order is watching.",CHARACTER,Nerien,male
"The mage disappears, and the flow of time resumes properly.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I...I swear I felt something rather strange just then. What just happened?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Some sort of ghost or apparition appeared. It spoke to me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm afraid I didn't see anything... Can you tell me more about what you just saw?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"It said something about danger ahead, and the Psijic Order.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Psijic Order? Are you quite sure about that? That's very odd. And danger ahead? Why that doesn't make any sense at all. The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time. Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins... Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The player can inquire further:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's the Psijic Order?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They were a group of mages with a history that pre-dates the Empire. Very powerful, very secretive. No one's seen them in well over a hundred years. They vanished, along with their sanctuary on the Isle of Artaeum. I have no idea what connection they'd have to this place.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Why is the Psijic Order contacting me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have no idea, but it's fascinating. Assuming it's true, of course. The Isle of Artaeum disappeared over a hundred years ago, and no one has seen them since. And yet now, suddenly, they have chosen to contact you? Why, it's intriguing! If nothing else, I'd take it as a compliment. The Psijics have only ever dealt with those they feel worthy.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"The two go to inspect the coffins, just as draugr escape. They're re-killed. The situation repeats in the next, larger chamber.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I've never seen anything like this in Nordic ruins before. Why, just look at all these coffins! This bears closer inspection. I'd like to stay a while and examine this. You, however, should press on. See if you can find whatever this vision of yours mentioned. But if it is truly dangerous, be careful. Go on ahead. I'll be sure and catch up with you before long.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"As promised, he eventually reunites with the player.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hold on, my boy. Hold on! I thought it high time I caught up with you.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"They reach a deep room with an undead guardian and a massive, magical sphere of unknown make.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well now...would you look at that. I never imagined we'd find something like this. Why is this buried so far within Saarthal?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"The boss attacks, but attacks aren't doing anything.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Nothing seems to work! Keep it busy. I'll try to drain some of its power.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Qiilaan us dilon!,CHARACTER,Jyrik Gaulderson,male
"They kill the draugr, then marvel at the free-floating contraption.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm not the only one seeing this, am I? Why, this is utterly unique.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
What is this thing?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have no idea! This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. The Arch-Mage needs to be informed immediately. He needs to see this for himself. I don't dare leave this unattended. Can you return to the College and inform Savos Aren of this discovery? Please, hurry.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What should I tell the Arch-Mage?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let him know that we've unearthed something... Well, I'm not sure. Something unique, let's say. It's clearly magical in nature, but like nothing I've ever seen before. He should be most interested.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Will you be all right by yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, I think I'll be fine. We seem to have eliminated the most pressing threat. It certainly seems that whoever placed this here intended for it to be well guarded. I wonder why...",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"At Tolfdir's behest, one returns to the College to report.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You are relatively new here, are you not? I have noticed you, but we have not spoken.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"No, we haven't.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then allow me to introduce myself.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
"No, sir.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"""Sir""? How quaint. I am Savos Aren, Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold. I am quite content to see nearly any aspect of magic explored and investigated here. But I do not and will not approve of any research or experiments that cause purposeful harm to your fellow members of the College. Are we clear?",CHARACTER,Savos,male
I need to speak to you about Saarthal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Please don't tell me that another one of the apprentices has been incinerated. I have enough to deal with right now.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
We found some sort of...orb. Tolfdir wanted you to see it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I...see. I trust that Tolfdir will provide a more...specific explanation.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
"We've found something in Saarthal, and Tolfdir thinks it's important.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very well, I trust you wouldn't be here were it not significant. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Tolfdir normally looks after your little group, yes? Since he's apparently occupied, and I will need to see this discovery for myself, I think perhaps you should begin researching the subject. Speak with Urag in the Arcanaeum. See if he is aware of anything that matches your discovery. And...good work. The next time you find yourself exploring Nordic ruins, perhaps this will be helpful.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
The player can inquire further about new subjects:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Dangerous research must be a problem here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not often, no. Some risks must be taken, to be sure. I am simply trying to avoid untimely deaths. We also must make an effort to avoid worsening what Skyrim thinks of us.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
What's the purpose of the College?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Purpose? I should think it's self-evident. Magic is a true power, not something to be shunned by commoners or treated as an amusing diversion by politicians. It shapes worlds, creates and destroys life... It deserves proper respect and study. The College is a place where we can focus on that, without the pressures of the world weighing down on us.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
I'd like to know more about the College's history.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've seen documents dating back to the late Second Era. Beyond that, it's hard to say. Events in the last several hundred years resulted in a significant loss of our history, I'm afraid.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
What happened in the last few hundred years?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Great Collapse, as it has come to be known. An unfortunate natural disaster that ravaged the area. The College fared far better than the city of Winterhold, but it was not left untouched.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
What caused the Great Collapse?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No one is sure of the cause. Some believed the eruption of Red Mountain had far-reaching consequences that were only felt years later. I know there are some who have blamed the College, said that we were responsible. I assure you this is not the case.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
Tell me more about the Great Collapse.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Sea of Ghosts practically came alive. No one was expecting it. Monstrous waves battered the shore for weeks on end. Winterhold was ancient and weathered, but it couldn't withstand the sea's fury. Entire districts of the city were lost overnight. The waves receded in time, but the damage was irreversible. Most residents of Winterhold abandoned what was left of the city. The College survived, and so here we remain.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
Have you ever met with the Psijic Order?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Personally? No, not I. One of their number used to advise the Arch-Mage when I was but an Apprentice here. But that was a great many years ago, before all the members of the order were called back to the Isle of Artaeum, and it disappeared entirely.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"Upon leaving the Arch-Mage's quarters, Faralda approaches.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
There you are. I've been trying to find you. I just wanted to let you know Ancano's been asking about you. I think he's looking for you.,CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Why would Ancano be looking for me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm not sure. Just... Well, mind what you tell him, all right?",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Is there a problem?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, no. Well, I don't think so. Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this ""advisor"" position he has is a sham, an excuse.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
What does it matter what I say to him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Between the two of us, there are rumors about him. That this ""advisor"" position he has is a sham, an excuse. That what he's really doing is spying for the Thalmor, trying to feed them information. Whether it's true, I can't say. But it never hurts to be a little suspicious, does it?",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Thanks for the warning.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You're welcome.,CHARACTER,Faralda,female
I'll say what I like to him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. That's your choice. I just wanted to let you know.,CHARACTER,Faralda,female
"The player finds Urag gro-Shub, the orc librarian, in the Artaeum.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You are now in the Arcanaeum, of which I am in charge. It might as well be my own little plane of Oblivion. Disrupt my Arcanaeum, and I will have you torn apart by angry Atronachs. Now, do you require assistance?",CHARACTER,Urag,male
I need to learn about something we found in Saarthal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I know what you want. Word travels fast around here. Discovered some big mystery, huh? Well you don't even need to ask. No, I don't have anything for you. Not anymore, anyway.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
You don't have anything that can help?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I said not anymore. Orthorn stole a number of books when he ran off to Fellglow Keep to join those Summoners. Some kind of peace offering. I think one of his volumes may have had some relevant information. If you want them, you'll have to talk to Orthorn.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
The player can ask about pertinent info.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Doesn't anyone care that Orthorn stole things from the College?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not enough to bother with it. Arch-Mage Aren's approach to these things is to just let them sort themselves out. Although now it looks like you'll be doing the sorting. Good luck with that.,CHARACTER,Urag,male
Who is Orthorn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He was an Apprentice here at the College. Not very skilled, but got involved with a group of mages who took a liking to him. When they left, he took off after them. Stole supplies and books from the College, I suppose as a way to ingratiate himself.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Why are these mages in Fellglow Keep?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let's just call it a ""difference of opinion"" with the College. They were interested in research that goes outside the bounds of what the College allows, so they were...persuaded to leave.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
"On the way out, the player is pulled aside by Ancano.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You there. I have questions for you. You were in Saarthal, yes? It has come to my attention that something was found there.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Maybe...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I know full well that you have. Please do not insult my intelligence. Tolfdir is still there now, is he? I shall expect a full report when he returns.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"Yes, we did. I just informed the Arch-Mage.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am well aware. Tolfdir is still in Saarthal, is he? I shall be expecting a full report from him when he returns.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
How do you know anything about this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It is my job to know these things. My role as advisor to the Arch-Mage is aided by knowing everything that transpires here.,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Why does this matter to you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Something was discovered in Saarthal that was significant enough that Tolfdir sent a new member of the College, alone, to deliver word. That sounds precisely like the sort of thing that should matter to everyone. Especially me. Thank you for your help. You may go now.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
The player can grill Ancano a little more afterwards.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
There's a rumor that you're spying for the Thalmor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? Preposterous, and just the sort of thing I would expect from mages who have nothing better to do with their time. I have made it quite clear that my only here is as advisor to the Arch-Mage. I would suggest that you not further spread this rumor.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
What is it you do here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I am an advisor to the Arch-Mage. The Thalmor wish to promote relations with your College. I am at the Arch-Mage's disposal if he requires advice.,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Does the Arch-Mage often ask for advice?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Perhaps not as often as he should. In time, I believe he will be more trusting.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
I'd like to know more about the Thalmor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that stability has been established between the Dominion and the Empire, we seek only to help Skyrim. To guide its people through this time of transition, to help lead them to a better future.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"The player journeys to Fellglow Keep near Whiterun, slaughtering hostile mages within. Eventually, one finds Orthorn imprisoned within.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Please! Help me! Don't leave me here!,CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"So, you're Orthorn?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, yes! Did Arch-Mage Aren send you? He sent you to rescue me, didn't he?",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
I'm just here for the books you took from the College.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? The bo... Oh. Oh dear. I shouldn't have taken them, I know! It was stupid. I was stupid. It won't happen again. Help me get out of here, and I'll help you find them. Please!",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
I'm here to rescue you and recover the books you stole.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
See? I knew Aren wouldn't leave me in here! Hurry and get me out of this cage before they come for me!,CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Where are the books you stole?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't have them anymore. She took them... The Caller. She's the one who put me in here! Please, let me out of here!",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
Why are you in this cage?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They threw me in here until they were ready to use me in one of their experiments. This wasn't supposed to happen. I thought they wanted my help, not to use me as a test subject!",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
Is there a key for this cage?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, it's the levers in the center there. Just make sure you don't pull the wrong one. Please, hurry. I don't like being in here!",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"Orthorn gets released, finally.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Thank you, thank you! I promise I'll help. And then I'll go back to the College and I'll beg them to let me back in.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
I don't want your help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah. I see. Well, then I'll just stay behind you a little bit, and follow along quietly.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
Now where are the books?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, of course. I said I'd tell you, didn't I? The Caller will have them. She was most interested in one of the volumes. Although not interested enough to keep me from being locked up.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, you saved me! Thank you so much. Who knows what they'd have done if you hadn't come along. I promise I'll help you get out of here.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
You should get yourself to safety.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't you need my help?,CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
I can handle this on my own.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, I... If you're sure... I'll just be on my way then. Please do be careful, and thank you.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
This will be easier without you getting in my way.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, I was only trying to help. Fine, I'll just save myself then. Thank you for letting me out of that cage.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"If you don't get away from me right now, I may kill you myself.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I was only trying to help you, you know! I hope the Caller turns you inside out!",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
You're right. I could use some help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I shall do my best.,CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
One eventually reaches the boss' chamber.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, you're the one who barged into my home and laid waste to my projects. How nice to meet you.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Names no longer matter. You may refer to me as The Caller. Now, do you have a reason for making such a mess?",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
I'm here for the books from the College.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So you're just one of Aren's lackeys? That's disappointing. You show real promise. You come here, kill my assistants, disrupt my work... You've annoyed me, so I don't think I'll be giving you anything.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
May I please have the books?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, now we're all please and thank you, are we? I'm afraid we're well beyond pleasantries. I'll allow you the opportunity to turn around, walk out that door, and never come back. I suggest you move quickly.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm afraid you don't have anything worth trading. Now, you can go back to your College and leave me be, or I can kill you. Your choice.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
An arrangement? After you've destroyed so much? Fine. Leave me the elf. You may go with your books.,CHARACTER,The Caller,male
I'm not going anywhere without those books.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable? Well, then you won't be leaving here at all.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
"Let me leave with the books, and there won't be any more trouble.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine. Take them and be gone. Never return here, or else you'll face my full wrath.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
"Are you attempting to threaten me? After I've been so hospitable? Well, then you won't be leaving here at all.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
If Orthorn is with and the player strikes a bargain with The Caller:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I, uhh... Wait, what?",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"He gets the books, I get you. It's very simple.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
But why?,CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"This little adventure of yours has cost me a number of test subjects. I need more, and you'll do nicely.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
"You wouldn't do that, would you? You wouldn't leave me here with her!",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"I'm waiting. Well, what's it going to be?",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
It's a deal. You can have Orthorn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine. Take your books and leave at once. If you ever come back, I won't be so gracious.",CHARACTER,The Caller,male
How could you just leave me here?,CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"The player reclaims the stolen books, one way or another. If Orthorn wasn't cruelly traded away:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well, everything worked out nicely, didn't it?",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
I've got what I came for.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, you certainly do. You'll be going back to the College, then? I, uhh...I think perhaps I'll wait a bit before venturing there myself. Let this whole thing blow over, you know. Give certain parties a chance to forget what I may have done. Still, you've gotten me out of that cage, and I won't forget it. Thank you again, and good luck to you.",CHARACTER,Orthorn,male
"Eventually, the player returns to the Arcanaeum.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here are the books that went missing.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, well. And you seem to be in one piece! Thank you. I'll look these over, and inform Mirabelle if I find anything relevant. ""Night of Tears,"" eh? I remember this one. Well, isn't that interesting. Did you read it yourself? If I recall correctly, that has some interesting implications. You should mention that to Tolfdir. And...here. I suppose you've earned these.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
"Tolfdir can be found in the Hall of the Elements, inspecting the strange orb that's been transported from Saarthal.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Urag suggested I come see you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Did he now? Does he have information about our wonderful discovery?,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"I found a certain book, ""Night of Tears""...",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Is that the one about something buried beneath Saarthal? Something that men and mer fought over? I'll have to make a point of re-reading it. I don't recall the details.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
There's a book he thinks you should read.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, yes. I'll be sure and stop by the Arcanaeum later. I just can't seem to tear myself away. Whatever it is, its beauty is like nothing I've ever seen before. If you'd allow me to indulge myself for a moment, I thought I might make a few observations...",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
He leads the player to inspect the orb.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm sure you've already noticed the markings. They're quite unlike anything we've seen before. Ayleid, Dwemer, Daedric... Not even Falmer. None of them are a match. Quite curious indeed. Now, I'm not sure you're quite as attuned as I am, given my extensive years of experience, but can you feel that? This marvelous object. It practically radiates magicka, and yet it's unlike anything I've felt before. Arch-Mage Aren is already hard at work, and hopefully we'll have more information soon.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Ancano approaches.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm afraid I must intrude. It is urgent that I speak with your associate immediately.,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
This is most inappropriate! We are involved in serious research here!,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"Yes, I've no doubt of its gravity. This, however, is a matter that cannot wait.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"Well, I'm quite sure I've never been interrupted like this before... the audacity!... I suppose we'll continue this at some later time, when we can avoid interruptions.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Tolfdir leaves the two alone.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I need you to come with me immediately. Let's go.,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
I don't understand what's going on.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Really? Well, allow me to clarify the situation. I'd like to know why there's someone claiming to be from the Psijic Order here at the College. More importantly, I'd like to know why he's asking for you specifically. So we're going to go have a little chat with him, and find out exactly what it is he wants.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Why are you so concerned about this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll be the one asking the questions. All you need to know is that the Psijic Order is a rogue organization, believing themselves to be above the law. They have clashed with the Aldmeri Dominion before, and I have no intention of allowing that to happen here.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Aren't you just an advisor here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Technically, that is true. But I still report to the Aldmeri Dominion, and I cannot ignore this situation. Don't worry, you can return to your petty squabbles and meaningless ""research"" as soon as this matter is resolved. Now, you are going to speak to this...Monk...and find out why he is here, and then he will be removed from College grounds.",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"Ancano leads the player to the Arch-Mage's quarters, where him, Aren and the others' prying.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm. It is good to meet you in person.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
What's going on? What happened to everyone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'd simply like to talk to you.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
What do you want with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I merely wish to talk to you.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
What did you do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"--- I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief. The situation here at your College is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed. I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object...the Eye of Magnus as your people have taken to calling it. The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen. The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
"If this is dangerous, then why don't you do something about it?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm afraid it's not that simple.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
What does this have to do with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You set this chain of events in motion at Saarthal. You must understand, the Psijic Order does not typically...intervene directly in events. My presence here will be seen as an affront to some within the Order, and as soon as we have finished, I will be leaving your College. I'm all too aware that my presence has aroused suspicion, especially in Ancano, you Thalmor associate. Nevertheless, my Order will not act directly. You must take it upon yourself to do so.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
So what exactly is the problem?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As you may have learned, this object...The Eye...is immensely powerful. The world is not ready for it. If it remains here, it will be misused. Indeed, many in the Order believe it has already... Rather, something will happen soon, something that cannot be avoided.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
"What do you expect from me, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We believe that your efforts should be directed toward dealing with the aftermath, but we cannot predict what that will be.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
"I'll help, but I don't know what to do.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Unfortunately, the future is as obscured to us as it is to you. The overwhelming power of the Eye makes it difficult for us to see. I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College. His perception may be more coherent than ours.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
Who is the Augur of Dunlain?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He was once a student here at the College. Now he is...something different.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
Where can I find this Augur?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I...I am unsure. He is somewhere within the College. Surely one of your colleagues must know his location. I am sorry I cannot provide you with further help, but this conversation requires a great deal of effort on my part. Now, I am afraid I must leave you. We will continue to watch over you, and guide you as best we can. It is within you to succeed. Never forget that.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
Why should I trust you or your Order?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I presume you refer to Ancano's distaste for the Psijic Order? The Thalmor see our Order as a threat because we have power, and we will not allow them to control us. I assure you that we mean you no harm.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
"The conversation done, Quaranir removes the time-stopping effect.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm sorry, were you about to say something?",CHARACTER,Savos,male
Well? What is the meaning of this?,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
Don't play coy. You asked to see a specific member of the College. Here he is. Now what is it you want?,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
There's been a misunderstanding. Clearly I should not be here. I shall simply take my leave.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
What? What trickery is this? You're not going anywhere until I find out what you're up to!,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"I am not ""up to"" anything. I apologize if I have offended you in any way.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
We will see about this...,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Ancano escorts the monk out of the College. The player talks to Aren.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm...I'm not sure what happened. A monk from the Psijic Order, here, after all these years, and then he just leaves. I hope we didn't offend him somehow.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
Have you ever heard of the Augur of Dunlain?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Has Tolfdir been telling stories again? I thought I made it quite clear that this was a subject inappropriate for conversation. Please don't allow him to continue to discuss the subject.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
Tolfdir is next asked.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Have you ever heard of the Augur of Dunlain?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well now, there's a name I haven't heard in some time. My goodness, it's been years since I've spoken with him. I suppose he's still down in the Midden, but I haven't checked. Are you going to see him? Do tell him ""hello"" for me, won't you?",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Where is the Midden?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Underneath the College. It's not the nicest place, so if you go down there, please be careful.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Can you tell me more about the Augur of Dunlain?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, I suppose he wouldn't mind... It was all before my time, you understand. I've heard the stories, the same as anyone else. He was a brilliant student, an accomplished wizard. Delved into magic in a way none had seen before. But, I think, he became too focused on just how much power he could acquire. That's what led to the accident.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"The player enters the Midden, the glacial tunnels beneath the College. If one didn't learn the Augur's whereabouts from anyone, a voice speaks:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
There is no help for you here. There is no solace in knowing what is to come.,CHARACTER,Augur,male
Deep inside is a locked door. A gravelly voice shouts from behind it.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Your perseverence will only lead to disappointment. Still you persist? Very well, you may enter.",CHARACTER,Augur,male
"Inside, one sees the Augur: not as a student, but as a giant, floating mass of pure energy.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So you're the Augur of Dunlain?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I am that which you have been seeking. Your efforts are in vain. It has already begun. But those who have sent you have not told you what they seek. What you seek.,CHARACTER,Augur,male
I was told to find you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Indeed. And so you have come looking, though you do not know why. Like others before you, you blindly follow a path to your own destruction. The Thalmor came seeking answers as well, unaware they will be his undoing. Your path now follows his, though you will arrive too late.",CHARACTER,Augur,male
And what is it I'm seeking?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You see that which all who wield magic seek. Knowledge. You shall find this: Knowledge will corrupt. It will destroy. It will consume. You seek meaning, shelter in Knowledge. You will not find it. The Thalmor sought the same thing, and it shall lead to his end as it has so many others.",CHARACTER,Augur,male
Thalmor? What Thalmor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The one who calls himself Ancano. He seeks information about the Eye, but what he will find shall be quite different. His path will cross yours in time, but first you must find that which you need.",CHARACTER,Augur,male
I'm not the first to come see you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, though you may be the last. The one who calls himself Ancano has sought my knowledge as well, through very different questions. Your path differs from most. You are being guided, pushed toward something. It is a good path, one untravelled by many. It is a path that can save your College. I will tell you what you need to know to follow it further.",CHARACTER,Augur,male
What do I need?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You, and those aiding you, wish to know more about the Eye of Magnus. You wish to avoid the disaster of which you are not yet aware. To see through Magnus' Eye without being blinded, you require his staff. Events now spiral quickly towards the inevitable center, so you must act with haste. Take this knowledge to your Arch-Mage.",CHARACTER,Augur,male
The player returns to Savos Aren.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have important information for you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? And what might that be?,CHARACTER,Savos,male
We need to find the Staff of Magnus.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm sorry, what? Well...I'd certainly love to have such a powerful staff, but I'm not really sure that any of us need it.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
It's connected to the orb we found.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And how do you know of this?,CHARACTER,Savos,male
I spoke with the Augur of Dunlain.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Did you really? And he specifically mentioned the Staff of Magnus? I... I'm impressed with your initiative. Of course, someone will need to follow up on this.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
What should I do next?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A most impressive attitude. Keep this up, and you'll do quite well for yourself.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"You mean me, don't you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I certainly do. Since you went so far as to seek out the Augur for advice, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic. Something as specific and ancient as the Staff of Magnus...I'm not sure we'd ever find something like that... I seem to recall Mirabelle mentioning the staff somewhat recently. Why don't you see if she can tell you anything? I'm quite pleased with your progress, you know. You've certainly proven yourself to be more than a mere Apprentice. Well done. This circlet once proved invaluable to me. I hope it can be of use to you know.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
The player tracks down Mirabelle Ervine.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Do you know anything about the Staff of Magnus?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Well now that's an odd question. Why in the world would you be asking?,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Arch-Mage Aren said you'd mentioned it recently.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see. Well yes, I suppose I did mention it, though I'm not sure what he expects me to tell you. I only brought it to his attention a few months back when the Synod showed up here looking for it. They were apparently under the impression we were keeping it in a closet somewhere.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
It may be connected to the Eye of Magnus.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The ""Eye of Magnus""? I can appreciate that this...thing, this Orb... It's very impressive. Very unique, and definitely worth studying. But let's not jump to any conclusions, or assign it importance beyond what we're certain of.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"The Augur referred to it as the Eye of Magnus, not me.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Augur? Just what have you gotten yourself involved in? Whatever is going on, whatever you're up to... Be very careful.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"Sorry. So, the Staff of Magnus?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, it's said to be very powerful. Has the capacity to store an incredible amount of magical power, as the story goes. But it's more myth than anything at this point. I've no doubt it actually exists, but no one has seen it in what, decades? Longer? I'm not sure. The only time I've heard it mentioned was when those Synod characters showed up some months ago looking for it.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Who are the Synod?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Mages based out of Cyrodiil. They fancy themselves the Imperial Authority on magic these last few hundred years. My understanding is that all they really do is make noise in an attempt to curry favor from the Emperor. Lots of politics, little magic. I was quite surprised to find them on our doorstep. They seemed amiable enough, but their line of questioning made me...uneasy. It became clear they're trying to hoard powerful artifacts, looking to consolidate power.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
So no one knows the Staff's location?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No one here does. The Synod seemed convinced it was somewhere here in Skyrim. They inquired about the ruins of Mzulft, but that's all I remember. It sounded like they were heading there, though they were rather secretive about why. I suppose if you're intent on looking for the staff, there's a chance they might be in Mzulft yet. Just don't expect them to be cooperative.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
What else can you tell me about the Staff of Magnus?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm not really sure. Made and used by Magnus himself, if you believe those sorts of things. I believe I've heard it said that it's the only thing that could adequately contain his power. The sort of embellishment wizards of ancient times loved to make.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"The player enters the Dwemer ruins of Mzulft, finding a dying Synod mage just inside.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Crystal...gone... Find...Paratus...in Oculory... Gah...,CHARACTER,Gavros,male
"He dies. Later, they find a door with a voice behind it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
G...Gavros? Is that you? I'd almost given up hope. Let me get the door...,CHARACTER,Paratus,male
The Synod mage Paratus Dicimius opens the door to find newcomers.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What the... What are you doing here? What've you done with Gavros?,CHARACTER,Paratus,male
Your friend Gavros is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It was the Falmer, wasn't it? Curse them! They've ruined everything! If Gavros is gone, there's no hope. He was supposed to return with the crystal... Without that, all our efforts are wasted. And you. If you're here for treasure, or wisdom, or anything, I'm afraid you've wasted your time.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I came here looking for the Synod.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And just why would you be doing that? Oh, it doesn't matter now. Gavros is never coming back, and he was supposed to have the crystal. Without that, we're lost. It's all been for nothing. So congratulations, whoever you are, you've found the Synod. Just me, alone, surrounded by angry machines and angrier Falmer.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
What's this about a crystal?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It didn't work the first time. I tried to tell Gavros, but he wouldn't listen. ""No, it won't be too cold"" he said. Well, I was right, wasn't I? Focused completely wrong by the time we got here! The cold had warped it! Gavros had to cart it all the way back to Cyrodiil. Left the rest of us here to fend off the damnable Falmer.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
What's the crystal for?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It was a brilliant idea, really. Mostly mine, though Gavros took the credit. Secret, though. Official Synod business. Can't talk about it.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
If I find this crystal you're looking for. Will you help me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't know what sort of help you expect from me, but if you can actually find the crystal I'd certainly be grateful.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I happen to have found a focusing Crystal. Is this what you were looking for?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You found...how in the world... That's it. That's it! I don't know who you are, but you may have just saved this little project... In fact, who are you, anyway?",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I'm with the College of Winterhold.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You are, are you? Savos wouldn't even grant us an audience when we came to you, but now you come here expecting something from me? I don't much like this, I'll tell you. But you saved my skin, so maybe I can overlook the past for now. Come on, I'll explain on the way.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"If one lacks the crystal, further inquiries can be made.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What are you doing here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am on official business of the Grand Council of the Synod. That's all you need to know. I might well ask the same of you, running around by yourself in this dangerous place.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I'm looking for the Staff of Magnus.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Are you? Well. I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I need the crystal to do anything useful, and I don't have it.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"If one goes to get the crystal after 1st meeting, there's extra dialogue.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Please, tell me you have the crystal. I've no wish to die in this place.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I found your crystal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha! So you did. I was almost beginning to think Gavros had gone and gotten himself killed just to spite me. Well, with the Falmer skulking around I can't very well do this on my own. I guess you'll have to come with me. I'll explain on the way.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"Either way, Paratus leads one further inside.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"No matter what Gavros said, this was my idea first. The Council is going to know that when I get back. I was the one who thought of using this...this Oculory. I don't know what the dwarves called it. Something unpronounceable, I'm sure. From all our research, it seems they were intent on discerning the nature of the divine. This machinery, all of it, was designed to collect starlight, and then... I'm not sure. Split it, somehow? It was my idea to replace one of the key elements with our focusing crystal. Months of enchantments went into it. Let's just hope they got it right this time.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
He leads them to a massive piece of dwarven machinery.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Here it is. Magnificent, isn't it? Took an incredible amount of work to get it running again. Now I'm hoping it'll all be worth it. Place the crystal in the central apparatus, and we can start the process for focusing it.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"The item is placed, causing the apparatus to flip upside-down.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What do I do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now the crystal needs to be focused. It was created so far away, we knew that some adjustments would have to be made. Heating and cooling the crystal will cause it to expand or contract, which will change how the light passes through it. You'll need to use spells to do that. Being from the College, I assume you know them already. There should be a few basic tomes around here somewhere in case your training is even more substandard than I've heard.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
The player uses the suggested method to focus the starlight. When all beams a wall. Two bright spots appear on the map.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Years of work, finally going to pay off... ...but what's this? These results... They're not at all what they should be. This projection should be lit up like the night sky... Something is creating an incredible amount of interference. Something in Winterhold, it looks like. What are you playing at? Is this some attempt to stall my work?! So, what is it? What have you done? Did you know what we were attempting? Are you here to make sure your plan worked, that our efforts have been for nothing? Well, explain yourself!",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
You'd better calm down.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You and your College have ruined years of my work, I've lost friends and colleagues to the Falmer, and you want me to calm down?",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
Did something go wrong?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Go wrong? Go wrong? Everything is wrong! Everything! Whatever you have at that College has completely interfered with our work here.,CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I don't know what you're talking about.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You show up here just as our work nears completion, and now I can't get any results from this because of something at your College. Do you think me a fool? Do you think I'm too stupid to make the connection? You've ruined my work! How did you do it?",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"I haven't done anything, I swear.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
But it must be something you're doing. There's no other explanation...,CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I truly have no idea what you're talking about.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Either you're lying to me, or...",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I don't understand why you're so upset.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Just look! This should be lit up brighter than the night sky, and it's not! Clearly you've interfered somehow. Or... You have something at your College, don't you? Something immensely powerful. Beyond anything I'd anticipated. What is it?",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
You mean the Eye of Magnus?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Eye of Magnus? Well, I suppose if that means what I think it does... Well, that's interesting...",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"We might have something, yes.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, now. This I hadn't considered. If that's taken into account, these results make more sense.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I'm not going to answer that.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So you do have something, then. Whether this was intentional or not, it suggests some interesting results.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
Can you help me find the Staff of Magnus or not?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, the staff. Interesting...",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're looking for something, yes? The...Staff of Magnus. Well, even if you are trying to ruin my work, there's still something to be learned here. I can't explain the details. That would mean giving away many secrets the Synod have learned over the years. Also, I doubt you'd be able to comprehend the details. Have you seen the Orrery in the Imperial City? It was the inspiration for this idea. Instead of projecting the sky, we project all of Tamriel, and then harness the latent energies to overlay the positions of... What's important is that all of this work was designed to reveal to us sources of great magical power. Purely to help safeguard the Empire, of course. And yet, in the end, only two locations have been revealed to us. One is your College. The other... Well, that can only be Labyrinthian. So, mage from Winterhold, despite your intentions I've beaten your little game. Even if all you've said here is lies, I know you have something in Winterhold the Synod Council will be very interested in. So fine, trudge off to Labyrinthian in search of your Staff. I shall return to Cyrodiil and deliver my full report to the Council. This is not over, I assure you.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
So the Staff of Magnus is in Labyrinthian?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, yes. Probably. I mean, yes. Certainly it is, but that doesn't matter now, because I know you're hoarding something even more important at your College. The Council will be informed of this. They will find out what you're up to.",CHARACTER,Paratus,male
I think you've been in here too long. You're crazy.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Am I? Am I? I think I've discovered more here than I could've hoped to. Your trickery won't confuse me! I think we're done here.,CHARACTER,Paratus,male
"After backtracking all the way out of Mzulft, it's finally time to report to closer.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I don't know. It's like a ward, but who's casting it? Ancano? How?",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"I don't care what it is, I want it down now! I want to know what he's doing in there!",CHARACTER,Savos,male
What's going on?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ancano. He's in there, doing...something. We don't know what. We're trying to get in now. I will have his head for this, I assure you. Help take this down, will you? We're throwing everything we can at it.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
I know where to find the Staff of Magnus.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Now's not the time. We need to put a stop to whatever it is that's going on.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
"With a magical assault, they destroy the giant ward to reach the Hall proper.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's going on?!,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Ancano! Stop this at once! I command you!,CHARACTER,Savos,male
Don't go near him!,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"There's a massive magical explosion. The player is knocked unconscious, and injured.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Are you all right? Can you walk? I need you on your feet. We're in trouble here.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
I think I'm okay.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ancano is doing something with that thing...the Eye. We can't stop him! I haven't seen Savos since the explosion. He must've been blown clear, and he may have be injured. I need you to find the Arch-Mage, and I need you to do it quickly! Get moving!",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
What happened?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'll be fine. I just need a minute to catch my breath. Find Savos...,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"The player walks outside and finds the Arch-Mage's corpse, having been blown see what occured.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's happened? He's not...,CHARACTER,Sergius,male
Is he dead?,CHARACTER,Phinis Gestor,male
"Everyone please, stand back! Please remain calm! Are you all right? What happened in there?",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
It's Ancano. He's done something with the Eye!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By the Nine... Is he responsible for this? The Arch-Mage, dead? There's more. Something's happened to Winterhold. It must be whatever Ancano did. You need to get out there and make sure it's safe. Quickly now, quickly! I'll find Mirabelle and see if we can't put a stop to this!",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Arch-Mage aren is dead?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can hardly believe it. But there's no time. Whatever happened here has affected Winterhold as well. I need you to get out there and make sure everything's all right. I'll do what I can here. Go now, go!",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"As Tolfdir rushes inside, the player tries exiting. Faralda is nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's going on? What happened in there?,CHARACTER,Faralda,female
Something went wrong. Winterhold may be in danger. Can you help?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It ""may be"" in danger? Take a look. I don't think there's much question. Let's get down there. We have to do something. Come on, Arniel. Let's go. Arniel: Do we have to? They'd never lift a finger to help us.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
There's no time. We have to make sure Winterhold is safe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We'll go with you, but when this is all over I want an explanation.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
The mages rush into town to protect the citizenry from strange wraith-like attackers. They defeat all ten of the curious creatures.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"That looks like it was the last of them. We'll stay here. Get back to the College and let them know what's going on. Arniel, stay on your guard. We can't let harm come to these people.",CHARACTER,Faralda,female
"With that, it's back to the Hall of the Elements.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well? Is everything out there all right?,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Winterhold is safe for now.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Wish I could say the same for us. Tolfdir and I can try and keep this contained. You need to get your hands on the Staff of Magnus. Now.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Why me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it. Besides, you're the one having all of these visions, aren't you?",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
You really think the Staff will help?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You were told to find it, weren't you? If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
Then I'm off to Labyrinthian.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What? Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there? That can't be a coincidence.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Arch-Mage.,CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
I don't understand. What coincidence?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Savos. Before...before he died. He... He gave me something just a little while ago. He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I think...I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him. Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think it would do you the most good now. Take it, and get out of here. Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us.",CHARACTER,Mirabelle,female
"The player journeys to Labyrinthian, one of the largest barrows in the entire old students are having a conversation.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Come on, we're finally here! Let's not waste any more time!",CHARACTER,Savos,male
Are we truly sure this is a good idea?,CHARACTER,Takes-In-Light,female
We'll be back at the College before anyone even knows we're gone.,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
"You would care about that, since you're the Arch-Mage's favorite!",CHARACTER,Girduin,male
"Don't forget, this whole idea was Atmah's to begin with.",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"Let's just get inside, see what's in there.",CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
The player finally steps foot inside. The ghosts appear again.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I can't believe we're doing this.,CHARACTER,Elvali,female
Can you imagine the looks on their faces when we come back?,CHARACTER,Savos,male
You keep talking like you're sure we'll find something useful in here.,CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
"Enchanted weapons, tomes of ancient knowledge, Shalidor's secrets themselves -- who knows what we could find!",CHARACTER,Savos,male
And what if... What if there are things guarding this place?,CHARACTER,Takes-In-Light,female
Against six College-trained mages? I think we'll be fine.,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
"In a large arena, a skeletal dragon and its undead helpers crawl out of the ghosts' conversation from years earlier.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
We...we have to go back. We can't leave Girduin...,CHARACTER,Elvali,female
"We barely made it out alive, and you want to go back in?",CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
What was that thing anyway?,CHARACTER,Takes-In-Light,female
It's too late. There isn't enough of him left to back in after.,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
"Gods, what have we done?",CHARACTER,Takes-In-Light,female
We can't go back. Might as well go forward. We can still do this.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
Savos is right. We can make it if we just stay alert.,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
"Further on, a door is blocked by a magical force. An unearthly voice calls from beyond.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Wo meyz wah dii vul junaar?,CHARACTER,Morokei,male
Melting the icy door to allows one to continue forward.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Nivahriin muz fent siiv nid aaz het. You do not answer... Must I use this guttural language of yours? Have you returned, Aren? My old friend?",CHARACTER,Morokei,male
The voice continues taunting the player as one delves further into the crypt.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Do you seek to finish that which you could not? You only face failure once more... You... You are not Aren, are you? Has he sent you in his place? Did he warn that your own power would be your undoing? That it would only serve to strengthen me?",CHARACTER,Morokei,male
"One breaks through the next enchanted door to find the ghosts again, the group now pared down to three.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Just another minute, please.",CHARACTER,Takes-In-Light,female
"Come on, we can't stop now. We have to keep moving!",CHARACTER,Savos,male
Where's Elvali? She was right behind me.,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
Dead. Something grabbed her from behind. Gone before I could do anything.,CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
"You're right. This is all my fault. Should we turn around, head back?",CHARACTER,Atmah,female
I don't think going back is a good idea.,CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
"Going back would be the end of all of us. We keep pushing forward, and we'll make it. We will!",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"Come on, you can make it. Let's go.",CHARACTER,Atmah,female
One presses on as well.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Come. Face your end.,CHARACTER,Morokei,male
"Beyond, another conversation with the ghosts plays.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
We shouldn't have left her there to die!,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
"What else could we do? Stay there and die with her? She refused to go on, we didn't have a choice!",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"This is it, you know. Through this door. Can you feel it?",CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
"We're not going to make it, are we?",CHARACTER,Atmah,female
"We stay together, no matter what. Agreed?",CHARACTER,Hafnar,male
I'll be right with you.,CHARACTER,Atmah,female
Agreed. We all stay together.,CHARACTER,Savos,male
"Finally, the deepest chamber is reached. There, the owner of the Staff and the one who did it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"...I'm sorry, friends. I'm so sorry! I had no choice! It was the only way to make sure that monster never escaped! I promise you, I'll never let this happen again! I'll seal this whole place away...",CHARACTER,Savos,male
"On the way out, a Thalmor agent appears.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, you made it out of there alive. Ancano was right...you are dangerous. I'm afraid I'll have to take that Staff from you now. Ancano wants it kept safe...oh, and he wants you dead. Nothing personal.",CHARACTER,Estormo,male
Get out of my way.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You fool. You don't stand a chance.,CHARACTER,Estormo,male
I have no quarrel with you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm afraid you do.,CHARACTER,Estormo,male
"After killing Estormo, it's back to the College. It's being attacked by more pushing the teachers out onto the bridge.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I hope there aren't any more.,CHARACTER,Arniel,male
"You survived! You have it, then? Let's hope it's as powerful as the Psijics believe it to be.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Where's Mirabelle?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She... She didn't make it. When it was clear we were going to have to fall back, she stayed behind and made sure the rest of us were all right.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Why are you all the way out here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Look for yourself. Ancano's power is growing. We can't crack whatever magic he's using to shield himself. I hope your trip to Labyrinthian was worth it.,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Let's get in there.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'll be right behind you!,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I'll be amazed if any of us survive this.,CHARACTER,Arniel,male
We never should have brought that thing here.,CHARACTER,Faralda,female
"With the other specialist mages following, the player leads everyone back to the Hall of the Elements, the seat of Ancano's powers.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You've come for me, have you? You think I don't know what you're up to? You think I can't destroy you? The power to unmake the world at my fingertips, and you think you can do anything about it?",CHARACTER,Ancano,male
Spells have no effect!,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
I am beyond your pathetic attempts at magic. You cannot touch me.,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
The Staff! Use it on the Eye!,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
Enough!,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"He paralyzes Tolfir and, if applicable, the player's follower.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Still you persist? Very well. Come then. See what I can do now.,CHARACTER,Ancano,male
"The player caps the Eye's power with the Staff, robbing Ancano of all his of his Thalmor ambitions.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I knew you could do it!,CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
What do we do now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I...I don't know. Ancano is gone, but whatever he's done to the Eye doesn't seem to have stopped. I have no idea what to do!",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male
"Just then, their old Psijic friend teleports in.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
We knew you would succeed. Your victory here justifies our belief in you. You have proven yourself more than worthy to guide the College of Winterhold.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
What do we do now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Eye has grown unstable. It cannot remain here, or else it may destroy your College and this world. It must be secured. Ancano's actions prove the world is not ready for such a thing. We shall safeguard it...for now. You now have the opportunity to maintain your College, and carry on with your lives. You have our gratitude, Arch-Mage.",CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
How did you know I'd be able to defeat Ancano?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
A great many things obscured to you are quite clear to us. We have long believed you would prevail.,CHARACTER,Quaranir,male
"Tandil and Gelebros, two other Psijics, teleport in as well, and together they remove themselves and the dangerous Eye.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You've done it! The College is safe again, thanks to your work. I knew you had it in you. I daresay the Psijics are right. There's no one more deserving to be Arch-Mage, in my opinion. Here, consider these yours. And the Arch-Mage's quarters as well. I shall be here for advice, should you need me.",CHARACTER,Tolfdir,male

"• You handle yourself well. You could make for a decent Shield-Brother. • Well, that's taken care of. No thanks to you.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
You didn't look like you needed help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Certainly not. But a true warrior would have relished the opportunity to take on a giant. That's why I'm here with my Shield-Brothers.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
I tried my best.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha. Another milk drinker crying about his effort. Glory only awaits those who triumph. And as Companions, our glory must always be hard-fought.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
• Who are the Companions? • What is a Shield-Brother?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"An outsider, eh? Never heard of the Companions? An order of warriors. We are brothers and sisters in honor. And we show up to solve problems if the coin is good enough.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Can I join you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not for me to say. You'll have to talk to Kodlak Whitemane up in Jorrvaskr. The old man's got a good sense for people. He can look in your eyes and tell your worth. If you go to him, good luck.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Sounds like a waste of time.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well nobody asked you. If you think you're better than we are, go talk to Kodlak Whitemane. See what a warrior of true mettle is like.",CHARACTER,Aela,female

Leave that to me.,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I'd like to join the Companions.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in hearts.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference. What matters is their heart.,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
And their arm.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"Of course. How are you in a battle, boy?",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I can handle myself.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That may be so. This is Vilkas. He will test your arm.,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
You dare question my skill?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Calm down there, whelp. Don't feel like you need to show off for our sake. Vilkas, here, will be the one testing your mettle.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I have much to learn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's the spirit. Vilkas, here, will get started on that. Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Aye.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
The player goes to the training grounds.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

After some swings:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There you go! Not bad. Next time won't be so easy! You might just make it. But until then, you're still just a whelp to us, new blood. So you do what we tell you to. Here's my sword. Go take it up to Eorlund to have it sharpened. And be careful, it's probably worth more than you are.",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
Up at the forge...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What brings you here?,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
Vilkas sent me with his sword.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm guessing you're the newcomer then?,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
Does Vilkas always send newcomers on errands?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, don't worry about that. They were all whelps once. They just might not like to talk about it. And don't always just do what you're told. Nobody rules anybody in the Companions.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'm just doing what I'm asked.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That attitude will get you far, if you were some stuffy merchant or a Jarl's footstool. Around here, you'll want to live your own life. Remember, nobody rules anybody in the Companions.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
"Someone has to be in charge, though.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, I'm not sure how they've managed it, but they have. No leaders since Ysgramor. Kodlak is the Harbinger, and he's a sort of advisor for the whole group, but every man is his own. Every woman, her own.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'll need to be going.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I have a favor to ask.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
What is it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I've been working on a shield for Aela. My wife is in mourning and I need to get back to her soon. I'd be much obliged if you could take this to Aela for me.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
Didn't you just tell me not to be a servant?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
This isn't a command...just decency. Help out an old blacksmith. I've got to get back to my work.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'm happy to lend a hand.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's a good man.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
Aela can be found with Skjor downstairs.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have your shield.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, good. I've been waiting for this. Are you new around here?",CHARACTER,Aela,female
"I told you, this is the whelp that Vilkas mentioned.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
"Ah, yes. I heard you gave him quite a thrashing.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Don't let Vilkas catch you saying that.,CHARACTER,Skjor,male
Do you think you could handle Vilkas in a real fight?,CHARACTER,Aela,female
I don't care for boasting.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, a man of action.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
I would kill him before he drew his sword.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Whoa, ease up there. We're rough, but there's no need to kill a Shield-Brother over a dispute. I like your fire though. You'll make a fierce Companion. Let us hunt together sometime. Here, let's have Farkas show you where you'll be resting your head.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Farkas!,CHARACTER,Skjor,male
Vilkas' brother comes down the hall.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did you call me?,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"Of course we did, icebrain. Show this new blood where the rest of the whelps sleep.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
"New blood? Oh, hello. I'm Farkas. Come, follow me.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
They walk down the hall while Farkas gives a rundown on the place.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Skjor and Aela like to tease me, but they're good people. They challenge us to be our best. Nice to have a new face around. It gets boring here sometimes. I hope we keep you. This can be a rough life. The quarters are up here. Just pick a bed and fall in it when you're tired. Tilma will keep the place clean; she always has. Alright, so here you are. Looks like the others are eager to meet you. Come to me or Aela if you're looking for work. Once you've made a bit of a name for yourself, Skjor and Vilkas might have things for you to do. Good luck. Welcome to the Companions.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
I'm looking for work.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Skjor was looking for you earlier.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
What does he want?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't know. He just said he needed to talk to you before you do anything else. I don't like making him angry, but there is some work for you if you want it.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
Dragonborn finds Skjor.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, there you are.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
You wanted to see me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I did. Your time, it seems, has come.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
What do you mean?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Last week a scholar came to us. He said he knew where we could find another fragment of Wuuthrad. He seemed a fool to me, but if he's right, the honor of the Companions demands we seek it out.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
What does this have to do with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is a simple errand, but the time is right for it to be your Trial. Carry yourself with honor, and you'll become a true Companion.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
I would be honored to retrieve it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There is a fine line and respect and bootlicking, new blood. But I like your spirit. We've decided this will be your Trial. DO well, and you'll be counted among the Companions. Farkas will be your Shield-Sibling on this venture, whelp. He'll answer any questions you have. Try not to disappoint...or get him killed.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
Farkas is nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I hope you've readied yourself.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
You're going to be my Shield-Brother?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
So I'm told. Let's see if you impress.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
Who was this scholar?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A smart man came and told us about a blade piece. Skjor thinks you should find it, and I'm supposed to watch you.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
What is Wuuthrad?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ysgramor was the hero who stared the Companions. Wuuthrad was his weapon. He came from the ancient homeland and killed all the elves. But not all of 'em, because some of 'em are still here.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
Why did Skjor call this my Trial?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I watch you to make sure you're honorable. If you are honorable and strong, I can call you brother.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
I'll meet you at Dustman's Cairn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't delay, Shield-Brother.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"The two go to Dustmain's Cairn, a crypt in Whiterun's western plains. Inside is evidence of someone messing up the place.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Looks like someone'd been digging here. And recently. Tread lightly. Be careful around the burial stones. I don't want to haul you back to Jorrvaskr on my back.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"In one of the rooms, Dragonborn flips a switch, locking him in an alcove.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Now look what you've gotten yourself into. No worries. Just sit tight. I'll find the release.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"At this moment, several Silver Hand mercenaries rush in, surrounding Farkas.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"It's time to die, dog.",CHARACTER,Silver Hand,male
We knew you'd be coming here.,CHARACTER,Silver Hand 2,male
"Your mistake, Companion.",CHARACTER,Silver Hand 3,male
Which one is that?,CHARACTER,Silver Hand 4,female
"It doesn't matter. He wears that armor, he dies.",CHARACTER,Silver Hand 5,male
Killing you will make for an excellent story.,CHARACTER,Silver Hand 4,female
None of you will be alive to tell it.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"Farkas transforms into a werewolf, slaughtering the bunch before releasing the gate lever.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I hope I didn't scare you.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
What was that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It's a blessing given to some of us. We can be like wild beasts. Fearsome.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
You're going to make me a werewolf?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, no. Only the Circle have the beastblood. Prove your honor to be a Companion. ""Eyes on the prey, not the horizon."" We should keep moving. Still the draugr to worry about.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
Who are the Silver Hand?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Bad people who don't like werewolves. So they don't like us either.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
The Companions are werewolves?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not everyone, but all the Circle are. It's a secret to everybody.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"Deeper in the crypt is a piece of Wuuthrad. They take it, defeat all the at the training grounds.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold. This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor. Who will speak for him?",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
Would you raise your shield in his defense?,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
"I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
And would you raise your sword in his honor?,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
And would you raise a mug in his name?,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"Then the judgment of this Circle is complete. His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers. Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
It shall be so.,CHARACTER,Companions,neutral
"Well, boy, you're one of us now. I trust you won't disappoint.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Is it true that the Companions are werewolves?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see you've been allowed to know some secrets before your appointed time. No matter. Yes, it's true. Not every Companion, though. Only members of the Circle all share the blood of the beast. Some take to it more than others.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
What about you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, I grow old. My mind turns towards the horizon. To Sovngarde. I worry that Shor won't call an animal to glory as he would a true Nord warrior. Living as beasts draws our souls closer to the Daedric Lord Hircine. Some may prefer an eternity in his Hunting Grounds, but I crave the fellowship of Sovngarde.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
You're looking to cure yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, but it's no easy matter. But you don't need to share the worries of an old warrior. This day is to rejoice in your bravery! And speak to Eorlund if you want a better weapon than...whatever that is.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
The player goes to Eorlund.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I was told you would have a weapon for me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, lad, you've been raised into the Companions, I hear. I can forge whatever kind of weapon you want. Finest forge in Skyrim, right here before you.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'd like a sword.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
A blade! It'll be as sharp as Fralia's tongue!,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'd like a dagger.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, the sneaky type, eh? I think we can fix you right up.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'd like a battleaxe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Just like Ysgramor himself.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'd like a greatsword.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Sure you can handle that? Hahaha. Of course you can.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'd like a waraxe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that's a smart weapon: light, strong, useful. Crack some skulls for me.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
"After doing another job, the quest-giver directs one to Skjor.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Yes, I have something special for you. But it's not for everyone to hear. Meet me in the Underforge tonight. We will speak more.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
Where is this Underforge?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I forget that you've never seen it. Beneath the Skyforge, where Eorlund works. The door is hidden, but I will show you the way.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
"That night, they meet as directed.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Are you prepared?,CHARACTER,Skjor,male
What is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Here's all you need to know. Jorrvaskr is the oldest building in Whiterun. The Skyforge was here long before it was. And the Underforge taps an ancient magic that is older than men or elves. We bring you here to make you stronger, new blood. Now, let's move.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
I'm ready for whatever test is next.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is no test, new blood. This is a gift. Come inside.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
"In the Underforge, Aela is already waiting in her werewolf form.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm glad you came. It's been a long time since we've had a heart like yours in our numbers. That pitiful ceremony behind the hall does not befit warriors like us. You are due more honor than some calls and feasting. I would hope you recognize Aela, even in this form. She's agreed to be your forebear. We do this in secret because Kodlak is too busy trying to throw away this great gift we've been granted. He thinks we've been cursed. But we've been blessed. How could something that gives this type of prowess be a curse? So we take matters into our own hands. To reach the heights of the Companions, you must join with us in the shared blood of the wolf. Are you prepared to join your spirit with the beast world, friend?",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
What if I don't want to be a werewolf?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That is your choice. We will not force you. But to join the Circle, your blood must be as ours. Meet us here when you're ready.",CHARACTER,Skjor,male
I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Very well.,CHARACTER,Skjor,male
"Skjor cuts Aela's hand, letting it bleed into the stone fountain. The player out in the wilderness.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Are you awake? I was starting to think you might never come back. Yours was not an easy transformation, but you're still alive. Congratulations. We even have a celebration planned for you. There's a pack of werewolf hunters camped nearby, at Gallows Rock. The Silver Hand. I think you've met them before. We're going to slaughter them. All of them. Lead on. Skjor's already scouting ahead.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
What just happened?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You were born into the pack, brother. I almost envy you, that first time is always the most...intense. You gave us even more trouble than Farkas did in his first turning.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Am I a werewolf now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You have the blood in you. You'll need to build up your strength before you're able to call on it again, though. Just be careful where you do it. Some cowards in this land can't stand the sight of glory before them.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
What does it mean to be a werewolf?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Nothing, until you choose to use it. Then, well...you got a taste. Stronger, faster. It doesn't last long, though. The blood of your foes can sustain you. If you're willing to feed. The more we feed, the greater our prowess will grow. We could perhaps discover even more gifts than Hircine.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Is there a cure?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Cure? Ha. You're sounding like the old man. I...I shouldn't say that. I love Kodlak. I respect and follow him. But he's wrong on this. It's no curse. We're made into the greatest hunters in the land. If he's worried about some mead-swilling afterlife in Sovngarde, he's free to pursue it. I'll take the glories of the hunt right here.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Where are we going?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Silver Hand have taken over the old fort at Gallows Rock. They always make such easy prey.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
Aela and her wolfy companion enter the fort.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Look at this. Cowards must have locked the place down after Skjor charged in. You can taste the fear.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
"They proceed onward, finding a dead werewolf chained up.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There's a dead one, isn't there. Thought so. Nobody we know, by the smell. Some can't separate the animal from themselves, go feral. This poor sod could have been anyone. We should keep moving.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Rats are nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
No surprise they keep vermin around. Filthy squalor.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
More werewolves are seen caged.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Nothing we can do for these ones now. Don't even want to think about what those cretins did to them before they died.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
They near the deepest sanctum.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We're getting close now, be careful. Their leader is a tricky one. They call him ""The Skinner"". I don't think I need to tell you why.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
"They defeat Krev the Skinner and his cohorts, but find Skjor's body nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The bastards...somehow they managed to kill Skjor. He's one of the strongest we had, but numbers can overwhelm. He should not have come without a Shield-Brother. Get out of here. I'm going to make sure we got the last of them, and see if there's any information to be gotten from the bodies. You and I have work to do. The Silver Hand will tremble at our sight.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
I'm looking for work.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And there is more work to be done, but I fear that Kodlak has gotten wind of our recent efforts. He's asked to see you. My advice? Always be honest with the old man, but don't tell him anything he doesn't need to know.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Down in Kodlak's quarters...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Thank you for coming.,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
You wanted to see me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, youngling. Have a seat. I hear you've been busy of late.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Aela and I work to avenge Skjor's death.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your hearts are full of grief, and my own weeps at the loss of Skjor. But his death was avenged long ago. You have taken more lives than honor demanded. The cycle of retaliation may continue for some time.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I work for the honor of the Companions.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Lad, I know what you've been up to. Mind you, it's no business of what each Companion does . But this sneaking around. It doesn't befit warriors of your stature. Aela knows this, and so should you. In any case, I have a task for you. Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Skjor said it was a blessing of Hircine.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, that sounds like him. As in all matters of faith, though, the reality is more complicated than one believer would tell you.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Vilkas said it was a curse laid upon the ancient Companions.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The boy has a nugget of truth, but the reality is more complicated than that. It always is.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
"So what is the truth, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood is only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my predecessors was a good but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven. If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord Hircine, we would be granted great power.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
And they became werewolves?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
But aren't you more powerful now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The witches didn't lie, of course. But it's more than our bodies.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
The witches should be hunted down for their trickery.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We'll get to that. It's not so simple as just killing them, though. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into our spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their mastery for eternity. And that is their choise. But I am a true Nord. I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Is there a way to cure yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's what I've spent my twilight years trying to find out. And now I think I've found an answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Am I to do this alone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You shall have no Shield-Brother this time. But the spirit of Ysgramor goes with you, to restore the honor of his legacy. Talos guide you, lad.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
It shall be done.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. Now move quickly. And don't leave any of them alive. Talos guide you, lad.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
I don't wish to remove this blessing.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is not about your desires, lad. Your own fate will be your own choice, just as always. Now be gone.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
The player travels to the coven in Falkreath and slays all the hagravens. On Kodlak.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Where have you been?,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
I was doing Kodlak's bidding.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I hope it was important, because it means you weren't here to defend him.",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
What happened here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"One of the fiercest battles I've ever seen. The Silver Hand. They finally found enough courage to attack Jorrvaskr. We fought them off, but...the old man...Kodlak...he's dead.",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
Was anyone else hurt?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, but they made off with all our fragments of Wuuthrad. But you and I are going to reclaim them. We will bring the battle to their chief camp. There will be none left living to tell their stories. Only songs of Jorrvaskr will be sung. We will avenge Kodlak...and they know will terror before the end.",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
The others have probably prepared Kodlak's funeral by now. Come up to the Skyforge to pay your respects.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
Kodlak's pyre sits atop the Skyforge. The other Companions stand nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Who will start?,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I'll do it. Before the ancient flame...,CHARACTER,Aela,female
We grieve.,CHARACTER,Companions,neutral
At this loss...,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
We weep.,CHARACTER,Companions,neutral
For the fallen...,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
We shout.,CHARACTER,Companions,neutral
And for ourselves...,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
We take our leave.,CHARACTER,Companions,neutral
Aela lights the pyre.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"His spirit is departed. Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Do you have the fragments of Wuuthrad still? I'll need to prepare them for mounting again.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I return them with honor. (Give fragments),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't get too flowery on me, lad.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
"Here, take them. (Give fragments)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Careful with those. Don't want even more fragments, do we? Of course, I have a small favor to ask of you. There is another piece that Kodlak always kept close to himself. Would you go to his chambers and bring it back for me? I'm not sure I'm the best one to go through his things.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
It would be my pleasure.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Thank you. I'll be here.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I guess I'll have to.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I appreciate it.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
The Dragonborn claims the final piece and returns to Eorlund.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You're back.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
I have Kodlak's fragment.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Thank you. Your Shield-Siblings have withdrawn to the Underforge. I think they're waiting for you.,CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
"Aela, Vilkas and Farkas are all in the 'Forge, talking about Kodlak's legacy.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
And you avenged him.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
Kodlak did not care for vengeance.,CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"No, Farkus, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.",CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"""There the souls of the Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel."" We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
Eorlund enters.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are made to be broken...and repaired.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
Is that...? Did you repair the blade?,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here. ""The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered."" The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more. As the one who bore the fragments, I think you should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle. The rest of you, prepare to journey to the Tomb of Ysgramor. For Kodlak.",CHARACTER,Eorlund,male
The Circle journeys to the aforementioned tomb in Winterhold.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This is the resting place of Ysgramor. And his most trusted generals. You should be careful.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
Are you not coming?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Kodlak was right. I let vengeance rule my heart. I regret nothing of what we did at Driftshade. But I can't go any further with my mind fogged or my heart grieved.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
Why do we need to be cautious?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The original Companions. Their finest warriors rest with Ysgramor. You'll have to prove yourselves to them. It's not that you're intruding; I wager they've actually expected us. They just want to be sure that you're worthy. Be ready for an honorable battle.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
How do we get inside?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Return Wuuthrad to Ysgramor. He should open the way.,CHARACTER,Vilkas,male
"The player puts the axe in the statue's hands, revealing a new passage. They come to a spider's den eventually.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I can't go any further, Shield-Brother.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
What's the matter?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ever since Dustman's Cairn, the big crawly ones have been too much for me. Everyone has his weakness, and this one is mine. I'm not proud, but I will stay back with Vilkas. Give my regards to Ysgramor.",CHARACTER,Farkas,male
"Eventually, Aela and the player find the hall containing Kodlak's spirit.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Greetings, Shield-Brother.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
"Kodlak, is that you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. My fellow Harbingers and I have been warming ourselves here. Trying to evade Hircine.,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
But there's nobody else here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You see only me because your heart knows only me as the Companions leader. I'd wager old Vignar could see half a dozen of my predecessors. And I see them all. The ones in Sovngarde. The ones trapped with me in Hircine's realm. And they all see you. You've brought honor to the name of the Companions. We won't soon forget it.,CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Vilkas said you could still be cured.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Did he now? I can only hope. You still have the witches' heads? Excellent. Throw one of them into the fire. It will release their magic, for me at least.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
"The player tosses a coven witch's head in, releasing Kodlak's wolf spirit. With Aela's help, they slay it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
We've killed your beast spirit.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And so slain the beast inside of me. I thank you for this gift. The other Harbingers remain trapped by Hircine, though. Perhaps from Sovngarde, the rest of the heroes of old can aid me in their rescue. The Harrowing of the Hunting Grounds. It would be a battle of such triumph. And perhaps someday, you'll join us in that battle. But for today, return to Jorrvaskr. Triumph in your victory. And lead the Companions to further glory.",CHARACTER,Kodlak,male
Kodlak's spirit disappears.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did I hear right? Did he say you were to lead the Companions?,CHARACTER,Aela,female
He did indeed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You've earned the right. Your strength and honor are apparent to all.,CHARACTER,Aela,female
Does this upset you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm just surprised. But your strength and honor are apparent to all. And it's my honor to be first to address you as Harbinger. Let's go tell the others. Nocturnal's quests tie into the Thieves Guild questline, so check there for the full lowdown.",CHARACTER,Aela,female
"Upon arrival in Falkreath, a guard approaches.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did you see a Dog out there?,CHARACTER,Falkreath Guard,male
"No. Some wolves, but no dogs.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, well.",CHARACTER,Falkreath Guard,male
I've seen whole packs of dogs.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, this was a specific one.",CHARACTER,Falkreath Guard,male
What sort of dog?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't know really. The blacksmith is offering a reward for a dog he saw on the road. I was hoping you'd seen it. I guess I'll stay on the lookout. Keep your nose clean while you're here, outsider.",CHARACTER,Falkreath Guard,male
One goes to the blacksmith.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Did you see a hound on the road? A fine, strong creature that's been wandering near town.",CHARACTER,Lod,male
"No, sorry. I didn't see a dog.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's one out on the road.,CHARACTER,Lod,male
The guard at the gate mentioned a dog.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I asked the gate guards to look for him.,CHARACTER,Lod,male
I've seen whole packs of dogs.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, no, this one's alone on the road outside of town. I can't afford to chase him down but I could use a fierce, loyal beast to keep me company. If you were willing to retrieve him for me, I'd give you some fresh meat to attract him out on the road.",CHARACTER,Lod,male
"Sure, I can catch him.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good! There's some gold in it for you if you succeed. Here's the meat -- check the road just outside of town.,CHARACTER,Lod,male
I could be convinced to catch him. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It's a smart man that demands something up front for his work. Some gold now and some when I have my dog. Here's the meat.,CHARACTER,Lod,male
"A ways west of Falkreath, the player finds a dog sitting on the road. It approaches and...begins speaking?!",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You are exactly what I was looking for.,CHARACTER,Barbas,male
You were looking for me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yeah, I think you'll be just what I need.",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
Did you just talk?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men ...and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so. You see, my name is Barbas. And I have a problem I think you can help sort out.",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
I've got things to do.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct. Sheesh! Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath.",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
"So, what could a dog need my help with?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
My master and I had a bit of a falling out. We got into an argument and it got rather...heated. He's kicked me out until I find someone who can settle our disagreement. That's where you come in.,CHARACTER,Barbas,male
Sounds easy enough. Let's go find him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Thank you. Now, since he banished me, Vile's been rather weak. He can't manifest very far from one of his shrines. I know there's a cult that worships him at Haemar's Shame. We should be able to talk to him there. If this works out, I'll make sure you're rewarded. Just don't trust any offer he makes you...okay?",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
So you're a lost little puppy?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very funny. My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person.",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
"Barbas leads the player to Haemar's Shame, a cave east of Helgen. At the back of the vampire den is a sheltered shrine to Clavicus.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Lord Vile, I have a request of you.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By all means, let's hear it. It's the least I could do, since you already helped me grant one final wish for my last worshippers... They were suffering so from vampirism, and begged me for a cure. Then you came and ended their misery! I couldn't have planned it better myself. So, what's your heart's desire? What kind of deal can we strike?",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
I'm just here to reunite you with Barbas.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ugh. That insufferable pup? Forget it. Request denied. No deal. I'm glad to be rid of him. Even if it does mean I'm stuck in this pitiful shrine, in the back end of...nowhere. Well...perhaps there is a way he could earn his place back at my side. Maybe. But no promises.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
An end to the civil war that plagues my land.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, if I had my full power, granting that would be trivial. I'd simply snap my fingers and everyone in Skyrim would die. War resolved.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
The power to crush all before me!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Really? Power? Haven't you already killed enough of your foes using the more mundane means at your disposal? Swords, magic, etc.? How...uninspired. As much as I hate to say it, you're almost as powerful as I am right now. But that's just because half of my power resides in that mutt, Barbas. Come to think of it, I know of a win-win situation for both of us.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
"Really? Power? You're a Dragonborn; you already have more power than most people who aren't immense, fire-breathing monsters. [It",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
What's your offer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There's an axe. An incredible powerful axe. An axe powerful enough for me to have quite a bit of fun, indeed. If you bring it to me, I'll grant you my boon. No strings attached. No messy surprises. At least, not for you. As I recall, it's resting in Rimerock Burrow. Barbas can lead you right to it. The little mutt might even earn his place back at my side.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
One can actually talk to Clavicus again.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"What did you want, again?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In Rimerock Burrow, there's an artifact called the Rueful Axe. Bring it to me, and I'll take Barbas back. Simple as that.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
The player can talk to Barbas at this time.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So what's the story behind the Rueful Axe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshipped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse. Clavicus gave him an axe.,CHARACTER,Barbas,male
"After slaying Sebastian Lort and retrieving the axe, it's back to Vile.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, you've got the axe! And my dog. Splendid.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
We're back. Now fulfill your end of the bargain.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Excellent work. A hero and his faithful companion, retrieving the ancient artifact for the prince. It's almost...storybook. Ah, but it almost seems a shame to give a weapon like that away, doesn't it? I suppose I could be persuaded to let you keep it... But only if you use the axe to kill Barbas. Simple as that.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
I sure would like to keep this axe...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And I could absorb the spirit of poor, dead Barbas. He'd still be reunited with me. And I'm sure Barbas doesn't want me to have that axe. He'd want it this way. The choice is yours, friend. We're all counting on you to make the right decision. Put him out of our misery!",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
No deal. Take the axe and take back Barbas!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hrmph. You're not fun at all. Guess I'll have to make my own fun elsewhere. And with the pup back, I'll be restored to my full power. There's a whole world just waiting for me!",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
If one goes to kill Barbas...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Wait a second, there's another option here.",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
I think I want to keep the axe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The axe isn't the only item dear old Clavicus has. Give him the Rueful Axe and once we're reunited the Masque of Clavicus Vile will be yours.,CHARACTER,Barbas,male
If the player kills Barbas...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
He's dead. Are we done here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Absolutely! Now I can reabsorb his body, and return to full power. All without having to listen to his whining! Oh, sure, he'll be back in a century or two, but think of the fun I can have 'til then. Enjoy that axe! And don't worry about poor old Barbas. After all, he really should have picked a better friend...",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
If the player forces Clavicus to take back Barbas...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I knew I could trust you.,CHARACTER,Barbas,male
"Yeah, yeah, dog gets master, master gets cosmic axe, everyone's happy. Just get over here, mutt.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
"Don't worry, I'll make sure he sees the light. I trusted you, now you trust me.",CHARACTER,Barbas,male
"Barbas disappears, then manifests as part of Clavicus' statue.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, that feels so much better! You forget how nice supreme power feels until you've been stuck in a cave for a few years. • It's a shame you wished for something so dull as me taking back the mutt. Quite a lack of imagination on your part. A lack of ambition like that really ought to be punished. Perhaps by turning you into a worm, or maybe a few decades of... • Now, as for your wish... An end to the war, was it? I'll make sure this war ends, all right. Just as soon as the dragons swarm across Skyrim and wipe out all of you puny... • Now, as for your wish... Power, was it? You can be a part of a tremendous power -- all you have to do is let your soul be absorbed by this axe. I never said it would be your power... Oh, fine. Have my boon and be done with it. I've got more interesting deals to make anyway.",CHARACTER,Clavicus,male
"Clavicus, having changed his mind, gives his Masque as a reward.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"In one of the city's bars, the player encounters Sam Guevenne.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place. A few drinks, a few laughs and a contest. What could be better?",CHARACTER,Sam,male
I don't really feel like drinking...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well come back when you do, my friend. Come back when you do.",CHARACTER,Sam,male
A drinking contest? You don't stand a chance!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha! We'll see about that. This is a special brew, very strong stuff. Let's get started. I'll start round one. Down the hatch! Your turn.",CHARACTER,Sam,male
Here we go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"One down, my friend. One down.",CHARACTER,Sam,male
This was a bad idea.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Sorry to hear that.,CHARACTER,Sam,male
The player takes a drink.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
And another one for me. And how about you?,CHARACTER,Sam,male
A second drink. Easy enough.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So says you. I think I've hit my limit on these things. Tell you what, one more and you win the contest.",CHARACTER,Sam,male
I'm done now.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Awww, well, maybe next time.",CHARACTER,Sam,male
The player drinks a second brew.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
One more. No problemsh.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Wow. You've really done it. The staff is yours.,CHARACTER,Sam,male
Thash grape!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You know, you're a fun person to drink with. I know this great little place where the wine flows like water. We should head there. Hey, you don't look so good...",CHARACTER,Sam,male
The player blacks out and awakens the next day...in Markarth. At the Temple of Dibella. An angry priestess serves as a wake-up call.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Wake up! That's right, it's time to wake up, you drunken blasphemer!",CHARACTER,Senna,female
Where am I?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course! You don't remember getting here.,CHARACTER,Senna,female
Blasphemer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see. So you don't remember fondling the statuary, then?",CHARACTER,Senna,female
"Unh, my head.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, your head hurts and you don't remember where you are. I'm guessing you also don't remember coming in here and blathering incoherently about marriage or a goat. Which means you don't remember losing your temper and throwing trash all over the temple.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
Was a man named Sam with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Dibella teaches love and compassion, but that doesn't mean we're just going to tell you what you want to know and let you walk away from this. Pick up your mess, then apologize, and if we think you're sincere we'll consider lending you aid.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
"I'm sorry, I don't even remember how I got here. (Persuade)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, you were deep in your cups when you got here. You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You said something about Rorikstead.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
"Oh, I'd love to help you figure it out, but I'm so busy cleaning up the mess you made of our temple... Now if you were to help tidy up and perhaps apologize afterwards...I might be able to help you.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
Tell me how I got here and I'll pay for the damages. ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, we can always use contributions. You were ranting but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead. Maybe you should take a look there.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
Oh you must be nobility of some sort. Running around partying and paying others to clean it up. I don't think so. Clean up your own mess.,CHARACTER,Senna,female
If the player cleans up the Temple:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I suppose that'll do. Dibella teaches us forgiveness, after all. Even for a drunk like you.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
So do you remember anything I said when I got here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You were ranting when you got here, but most of it was slurred. You did say something about Rorikstead. Maybe you should take a look there.",CHARACTER,Senna,female
"The next step is visiting Rorikstead, the tiny farming community between Markarth and Whiterun. An angry farmer is nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You! You've got a lot of nerve showing yourself in this town again. What do you have to say for yourself?,CHARACTER,Ennis,male
I'm sorry?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sorry's not good enough! Not while my Gleda is still out there, alone and afraid. You kidnapped her and sold her to that Giant!",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
I have no idea what you're talking about.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Is that so? Does the name Gleda ring a bell? The star beauty of my farm? Kidnapped by a drunk lout and sold to a Giant? You'd better remember her right fast, before I call the guards and have you hauled away.",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
That sounds pretty bad...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You're damned right it does. I'll never breed another prize-winning goat like Gleda! And don't you think of coming back to Rorikstead until you get her back from that Giant.,CHARACTER,Ennis,male
What happened with Gleda again? I'm a little fuzzy on that.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You really don't remember stealing a goat and selling her to a Giant? Are you thick? Go get her! At least she's bound to follow you back -- you smell just like the fermented feed she likes.,CHARACTER,Ennis,male
Did I say anything about where I left a staff?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You mentioned something like that... when you were running off with my goat! Tell you what -- you bring back my goat, and maybe I'll give a damn about your staff.",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
Help me retrace my steps and I'll pay you for the goat. (1000 gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine, but I'll still be missing my Gleda. Doubt I'll ever have a prize winning goat again. Most of what you said was gibberish but you left a note. The only bit I could read was ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.""",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
There's not enough money in the world to replace Gleda.,CHARACTER,Ennis,male
"I need to find Sam and the staff, in order to get Gleda back. (Persuade)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I suppose that makes sense. You didn't mention a Sam and nothing you said about the staff made sense. You left a note but it was mostly gibberish, the only bit I could make out was ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun.""",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
You didn't seem to need either to sell Gleda to the Giant in the first place. I think you'll figure it out.,CHARACTER,Ennis,male
Tell me everything and you won't end up like your goat. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay, okay. Most of what you said didn't make sense but you left a note. The only bit that I could read said ""after repaying Ysolda in Whiterun."" That's all I know.",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
"Do what you have to do, I'm not giving up on Gleda.",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
One can go kill the giant to bring Gleda back.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here's your goat. Now can you help me retrace my steps?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Gleda! And not a scratch on her! Happy day! I still can't figure out why you stole her. You left a note explaining it, but half of it was gibberish and the rest had mead spilled on it. Only bit I could make out was ""repaying Ysolda in Whiterun,"" and even that's mostly scribbles. Guess you could try there.",CHARACTER,Ennis,male
The player visits the merchant Ysolda in Whiterun.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, you're finally back. Look, I've been patient, but you still owe me.",CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
"Okay, how much do I owe you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's not about the money, really. I wouldn't have given you the wedding ring on credit if you weren't so obviously in love. But if there isn't going to be a wedding, the least you can do is give the ring back. That was one of my best pieces.",CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
"Yeah, I've been getting that a lot.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aw, what's wrong? Did the engagement fall through? Look, how about we call it even, as long as you bring back the wedding ring? That's really a shame -- I was so looking forward to the wedding. You said you'd have all the most interesting guests.",CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
Do you know what I did with it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You went right out to give it to your fiancee! Don't you even remember where you left her? And after you told me that sweet story of how you met in Witchmist Grove! I can see why she left you.,CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
"Seriously, let me pay you for the ring. (2000 gold)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Decided to go through with it then? I knew you couldn't have forgotten about your fiance. You spoke of her so glowingly. I don't know much about Morvunskar but it sounded like a lovely place for the ceremony. Congratulations.,CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
I think I would prefer my ring back. I put a lot of time into making it and you just gave is away as a joke.,CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
I just need to get to the wedding. Please. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You must have had a wild night if you can't remember that. But I suppose everyone gets the jitters before their wedding. And I did say you could take a bit of time paying me back. You said the ceremony was going to be at Morvunskar. Don't forget you still owe me!,CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
I'm sure your bride-to-be will tell you when you where the ceremony will be. If she still wants to marry you when you tell her you can't afford the ring.,CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
I don't care about the ring! Tell me what else I said! (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right, all right. You're mean when you're sober. You said you the ceremony was going to be in Morvunskar. You said your friend Sam was going to be your best man.",CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
You think you can bully me. I grew up with five brothers. Go... get...my...ring.,CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
What was that story about my fiancee?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"How could you forget? It was the sweetest story I'd ever heard. You met at the full moon, under the biggest tree in Witchmist Grove, surrounded by fireflies. It was straight out of a storybook.",CHARACTER,Ysolda,female
"The player can go to Witchmist Grove, finding the fiancée: a hagraven...",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Darling! I've been waiting for you to return, to consummate our love!",CHARACTER,Moira,female

"Now dead, the player takes the ring back to Ysolda.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Eventually, the player heads to Morvunskar, a mage-run fortress. Inside, a revellers are waiting.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You're here! I was beginning to think you might not make it.,CHARACTER,Sam,male
It was quite a trip. Where are we?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I thought you might not remember your first trip here. You had a big night. I think you've definitely earned the staff.,CHARACTER,Sam,male
I have all the things needed to repair it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, the Hagraven feather and so on. You can throw all those out. You see...",CHARACTER,Sam,male
"Sam transforms, revealing himself as the Daedric Lord Sanguine.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I really just needed something to encourage you to go out into the world and spread merriment. And you did just that! I haven't been so entertained in at least a hundred years!,CHARACTER,Sanguine,male
So all of this was just a prank?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Just a prank? Just a prank? The Daedric Lord of Debauchery does not deal in mere ""pranks."" This may have begun as a minor amusement, but it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff.",CHARACTER,Sanguine,male
Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Debauchery! I know, I know, how could I lie to you? Well, how could I trust you until we've shared a few drinks? But it wasn't long before I realized you'd make a more interesting bearer of my not-quite-holy staff than this waste of flesh.",CHARACTER,Sanguine,male
"Thanks, I guess.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
My pleasure. But I think it's time for you to go. No fun keeping you locked up in here with the staff.,CHARACTER,Sanguine,male
Why did you choose me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let's be honest, here. I don't always think my decisions through. But you...you're going places. Maybe a little influence from your old uncle Sanguine could help adjust your course a bit...",CHARACTER,Sanguine,male

We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?,CHARACTER,Priestess,female

I'm not afraid of you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. Perhaps I've misjudged.,CHARACTER,Priestess,female
Who is Boethiah?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Lord of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Devourer of Trinimac. The Queen of Shadows, Goddess of Destruction, He-Who-Destroys and She-Who-Erases... Many are our lord's lofty names, but they befit only us mortals. Intone her mighty names from now until the end of time -- it is for naught. Names mean nothing to our Lord.

"My heart is full of purpose, and my life is full of deeds.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you desire a glimpse of our Dark Mistress, then this is what you must do. First, prove your tongue can wield a lie. Find someone. Gain his trust. Lead him to the shrine above. Next, instruct your thrall to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice. Its magic will ensnare him, rendering him helpless. Then, girded with certitude, plant the ceremonial blade deeply, so that the waters of his heart wash over you. If your will is strong enough, it will stir Boethiah in her Dark Mansion, and she will appear before us.",CHARACTER,Priestess,female
I'll do it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I am called Boethiah. Many names have mortals given to me. But I am not interested in names. I am interested only in deeds.,CHARACTER,Boethiah,female

I have slain Cosnach to gain your favor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
My favor? My good pleasure is not some trophy for mortal sport! I should slay you for such insolence!,CHARACTER,Boethiah,female
My reasons are my own.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Indeed. But I abide only those whose will is aligned with my own. Those who oppose my desires perish in the most dreadful of ways.,CHARACTER,Boethiah,female

"Is that so? You should be. Though a heart without fear is something I can use... Perhaps you are the one I seek. We shall soon find out. Listen. All of you! Hear me! I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do. You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves. But which among you truly exceeds the rest? Prove yourselves to me! I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.",CHARACTER,Boethiah,female

Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat. Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?,CHARACTER,Boethiah,female

"""Seen my coming""? What do you mean?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Azura has given me the gift of foresight. I had a vision of you walking up the steps to this altar long before you were born. You have been chosen to be her champion. I know it is unexpected, but do not worry. It will all unfold as she has predicted.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
What is this place? Who's Azura?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This shrine was built by the Dunmer. As our land was scorched by fire and brimstone, Azura's prophecies led us to safety. She is a Daedra, a powerful being who watches from beyond our mortal plane. She has chosen you to be her champion.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
I don't believe in fate.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Perhaps that is what you are meant to believe. To better serve your role as Azura's champion. Do not fight it. Azura's prophecies always come to pass. To deny them is to go headlong into the darkness with no light to guide you.,CHARACTER,Aranea,female
Very well. What does Azura need?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You must go to a fortress, endangered by water, yet untouched by it. Inside, you will find an elven mage who can turn the brightest star as black as night. It is crytic, I know, but Azura's signs are never wrong. I believe the fortress may refer to Winterhold. Ask if they know this elven enchanter.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
I'm not anyone's champion. Find someone else.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There is no one else, but very well. I cannot force you to accept your destiny. Twilight guide your path.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
The player can inquire further about Azura.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'd like to know more about Azura.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She is the Goddess of Dawn and Dusk. Azura sees into the Twilight of the future, and guides her followers through it.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
Where did this shrine come from?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My people, the Dunmer, built it. We fled from Morrowind after Vvardenfell erupted almost 200 years ago. Those of us who were faithful to Azura were given a vision that led us away from the island before the worst came. This shrine is our thanks to her. That none will forget she watches over us all.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
Are you all alone here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. There were others at first, but Azura's visions tested everyone's faith. One by one, they left. Afraid to know their own future. But I refused to abandon the shrine. The visions are a gift. Azura warns me of tragedy, war, death before it happens. I won't leave her guidance.",CHARACTER,Aranea,female
"In Winterhold, the player goes to the inn to inquire about an enchanter.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Is there an elven mage here that studies stars?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Mages are up in the college. You can ask them, if they'll let you in. Then again, Nelacar might know. He's an old-timer from the College, but he has a room here.",CHARACTER,Dagur,male
The player goes to Nelocar.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I don't deal with any College applicants these days, so don't bother asking.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
I'm looking for an elven mage who studies stars.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Who sent you? Was it the College? The Jarl? We agreed there would be no more questions.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
A priestess of Azura sent me. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Azura? Gods, it's all finally coming back to haunt me.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
You're working with the Daedra? Right. Now tell me the one about the Argonian Maid and the lusty baron.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
"Look, I'm willing to pay. ( gold)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
A few coins for my soul? If only you understood the irony.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
I don't think you understand. I'm not answering questions.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
I didn't agree to anything. Talk. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Just calm down. I'll tell you everything.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
Do you think muscling me is going to work? I'm a wizard. An old. Elven. Wizard. Think about it.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male

The player convinces him.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What do you know about soul gems?,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
"They're for enchanting, correct?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
They are. Except the gem is always consumed. They're frail. Except for one.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
Soul gems? Why are you asking?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's what caused all the trouble. Soul gems are used in enchanting, but they break afterwards. Except one.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
Don't change the subject.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Soul gems are the subject, friend. They're used in enchanting, then they break. Except one. Azura's Star. A Daedric artifact that allows any number of souls to pass through it. Some of us wanted to find out how. I was working under Malyn Varen, then. If only we knew what he was really planning. Get to the point.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
What did Malyn do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Malyn wanted to alter the Star. He was dying. Disease. He thought he could store his own soul inside. Become immortal. It drove him mad. Students started dying. Eventually, the College exiled him. He took a few loyal disciples to Ilinalta's Deep and vanished. Look, I don't care who asked you to find the Star, but don't take it back to Azura. The Daedra are evil. They're the reason Malyn went insane.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
The player can inquire further about Nelacar's subjects.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How does Azura's Star work?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I mentioned how the Star is a soul gem, only it never gets depleted? There's another rule the artifact follows. You can only store white souls in the Star, belonging to the lesser creatures. Azura's magic won't allow black souls to enter it. As a mortal, Malyn's soul was black, so part of his work was breaking past Azura's rules. He was close before...well, I already told you.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
How did the Daedra drive Malyn insane?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Azura is no ordinary Daedra. She commands an entire realm in of Oblivion. The more Malyn worked on the Star, the more she was able to damn him. It started slowly at first. Malyn would see things that weren't there. Then he would yell at students over words they hadn't said. Then one day I walked in and Malyn had...killed a student, and in a horrific moment of inspiration, he started using her soul for his work.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
It sounds like Malyn got what was coming to him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The College would agree with you, but do you have any idea how many innocent lives were cut short, just so Azura could have revenge? We're nothing to the Daedra. Pawns to move around, praise, and punish as they see fit.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
"The Dragonborn makes for Ilinalta's Deep, an old ruin along Lake Ilinalta person to give the Star to.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
NELOCAR'S PATH NELOCAR'S PATH,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star. Maybe this is my chance to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant to before his madness. It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black soul would be able to enter it once we finished.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
Let's do it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Give me a minute to examine the Star. I'll see what we need to do.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
I'd like to think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right, but hurry. Who knows if Azura is watching us? These fissures and cracks aren't encouraging. Malyn was obviously growing more desperate once he left the College. He did it. He actually managed to trap his own soul inside the Star, but it's falling apart. It needs more and more souls to sustain itself. The Star is being used to sustain Malyn's soul. I can't fix it while that fragment of him is inside.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
So we need to deal with Malyn somehow.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Precisely. But it's not as simple as enchanting Malyn away. He's put up barriers. Souls are only allowed in, not out. If we were to... somehow...send a soul inside the Star. One that was ready to overpower Malyn from the inside...",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
I don't like where this is going.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
"You want to send my soul inside, don't you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A special type of soul trap. Placing you within the Star without fully killing you. Once Malyn has been dealt with, I'll bring you back. I understand if you need some time to prepare. Let me know when you're ready.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
Won't that kill him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He's already dead. Worse, the enchantment keeping him intact requires black souls. I don't know how many people he must have killed. If we don't do something, the enchantment will eventually fade, and the Star will slip back into Oblivion. Azura will have the last laugh.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
The player can ask Malyn further about what will happen:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What do I do once I'm inside?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Malyn's soul should be in the Star. Theoretically, purging him will be just like killing a ghost anywhere else. I'll have a magical tether to your soul while you're inside. Once you're done, it'll be as simple as pulling you back into your body.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
What's to keep me from ending up like Malyn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Malyn's soul is beyond home because his body is dead. But I'll be keeping you just slightly alive on this end. But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. There's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
When one has the determination to proceed...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm ready to enter the Star.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay. Stand still. This might sting. First, I'll need to grab hold of your soul. Now, take a deep breath.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male

"Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul. Good. I was getting... hungry. Wait. There's something different about you. This experiment of yours is over!",CHARACTER,Malyn,male

And who are you to challenge me? I have conquered mortality itself. I've spat in the eyes of the Daedric Lords. This is my realm now. I've sacrificed too much for let you take it from me!,CHARACTER,Malyn,male
The player kills Malyn.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
No. Not like this.,CHARACTER,Malyn,male
Nelacar can be heard.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
The player is put back in his/her own body.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself. We've done it. The Star has been cut from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
What do we do with it now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now? You could use it for what we meant it for. Using black souls for enchanting. The Black Star will never decay, but it can no longer hold the white souls of lesser creatures. You keep it.",CHARACTER,Nelacar,male
"If it's fixed, then it's mine.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Go ahead. Take it. I'd sooner finally put this chapter of my life behind me. Congratulations. You've altered the fate of a Daedric artifact and lived.,CHARACTER,Nelacar,male

Trust Septimus. He knows you can know.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male
The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What do I do with this sphere?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The deepest doors of Dwemer listen for singing. It plays the attitude of notes proper for opening. Can you not hear it? Too low for hearings?,CHARACTER,Septimus,male
What do I do with this cube?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"To glimpse the world inside an Elder Scroll can damage the eyes. Or the mind, as it has to Septimus. The Dwemer found a loophole, as they always do. To focus the knowledge away and inside without harm. Place the lexicon into their contraption and focus the knowings into it. When it brims with glow, bring it back and Septimus can read once more.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male
What do you want with the Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ooooh, an observant one. How clever to ask of Septimus. This Dwemer lockbox. Look upon it and wonder. Inside is the heart. The heart of a god! The heart of you. And me. But it was hidden away. Not by the Dwarves, you see. They were already gone. Someone else. Unseen. Unknown. Found the heart, and with a flair for the ironical, used Dwarven trickery to lock it away. The Scroll will give the deep vision needed to open it. For not even the strongest machinations of the Dwemer can hold off the all-sight given by an Elder Scroll.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male
What is an Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You look to your left, you see one way. You look to your right, you see another. But neither is any harder than the opposite. But the Elder Scrolls...they look left and right in the stream of time. The future and past are as one. Sometimes they even look up. What do they see then? What if they dive in? Then the madness begins.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male

I've inscribed the lexicon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Give it, quickly. Extraordinary. I see it now. The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals. Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it. A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them. The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key. Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when the set is complete.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male
Why are you so eager to open the box?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The box contains a heart. The essence of a god. I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity. The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male
Who is your lord?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Daedric prince of the unknown. Hermaeus Mora. I thought there were no secrets left to know. Until I first spoke to him. He asks a price -- to work his will. A few murders, some dissent spread, a plague or two. For the secrets I can endure. In time, he brought me here. To the box. But he won't reveal how to open it. Maddening.",CHARACTER,Septimus,male

What ring?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations. Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it. I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times. Like...with the little girl.",CHARACTER,Sinding,male
What kind of transformations?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway. I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame. That's why I wanted the ring...it was said to give men like me control. Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside me, as strong as ever.",CHARACTER,Sinding,male
What will you do now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've been looking for a way to appease Hircine. There is a certain beast in these lands. Large, majestic. It's said that Hircine will commune with whoever slays it.

But while I'm stuck in here, the beast wanders free.",CHARACTER,Sinding,male
I'll take the ring to Hircine.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Bring him down and...well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you. I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin. Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell.",CHARACTER,Sinding,male
Who is Hircine?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Why did this make you attack the girl?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I had just come into Falkreath. They needed some help working the mill, and I thought that would be something safe. Something I could do. When I saw the little girl, I was just...I could feel it coming on. I could taste the...I needed to hunt. But this pitiful, limited body wasn't meant for hunting. Slow. No claws. Weak, mashing teeth for chewing cud. I held in my rage as long as I could. But it boiled inside of me. She looked so fragile. Helpless prey. And then... I... I feel terrible about what happened.

Stanley, that talking grapefruit from Passwall. Wrong on all accounts, aren't I? Ha! No matter! Honestly, I don't want to know. Why ruin the surprise? But more to the point.

You do realize who you're dealing with here?",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
I think I made a mistake coming here...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

All I cared about was riding narwhales and sleeping in honeycombs and drinking babies' tears... Word of advice if you ride a Narwhale. Mind the pointy end. Ah, but there I go, waxing poetic about my misspent youth. Now where were we? Ah yes. You're the mortal messenger. An I am...? Honestly. Have you any idea?",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male

"Wrong! Actually, you do. Sort of. I am a part of you, little mortal. I am a shadow in your subconscious, a blemish on your fragile little psyche. You know me. You just don't know it. Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. At your service.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
All I know is that your people need you to return.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"apologize, it's just that I find myself suddenly and irrevocably... Bored! I mean, really. Here you stand, before Sheogorath himself, Daedric Prince of Madness, and all you deem fit to do is...deliver a message? How sad.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
You're a madman.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Jolly good guess! But only half right. I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me to myself every few thousand years. Now you. You can call me Ann Marie. But only if you're partial to being flayed alive and having an angry immortal skip rope with your entrails. If not... Then call me Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. Charmed.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
Who were you talking to?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Emperor Pelagius III. Now surely even you know about Pelagius' decree? On his deathbed -- oh, and this was inspired -- he forbade...death! That's right! Death! Outlawed!",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"Wait, where are we?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Inside the mind of Pelagius, silly. Oh. Is it your...first time?",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
The player delivers the message.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So does that mean you'll leave? Or not?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that's the real question, isn't it? Because honestly, how much time off could a demended Daedra really need? So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to leave. That's right. I'm done. Holiday... complete. Time to return to the hum drum day-to-day. On one condition. You have to find your way out first. Good luck with that.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
Simple.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Is it?,CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"Okay, what's the catch?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha! I do love it when the mortals know they're being manipulated. Makes things infinitely more interesting. Care to take a look around? This is not, I dare say, the Solitude botanical gardens. Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are? Welcome to the deceptively verdant mind of Emperor Pelagius III. That's right! You're in the head of a dead, homicidally insane monarch. Now, I know what you're thinking. Can I still rely on my swords and spells and sneaking and all that nonsense? Sure, sure. Or...you could use...The Wabbajack! Huh? Huh? Didn't see that coming, did you?",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"He hands the player his artifact for the journey. One picks a path, earning a brief narration from the Mad God.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You've headed down the path of dreams. Unfortunately for you, Pelagius suffered night terrors from a young age. All you need to do is find something to wake our poor Pelagius up. You'll find his terrors easy to repel...but persistent.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"The player fends off his wicked dreams, using the Wabbajack to turn them into adorable things, like goats and pretty girls.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well, now that's something to crow about. With Pelagius up and about you're moving right along. We'll both be home in no time.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"One goes down the next, ice-filled path.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, now this is a sad path. Pelagius hated and feared many things. Assassins, wild dogs, the undead, pumpernickel... But the deepest, keenest hatred was for himself. The attacks he makes on himself can be seen here fully. They are always carried out on the weakest part of his fragile self. The self-loathing enhances Pelagius' anger! Ah, but his confidence will shrink with every hit. You must bring the two into balance.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"The player finds two Pelagius, one big and one small; the former attacks the latter. The Wabbajack tips the battle's scales.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Wonderfully done. Pelagius is finally ready to love himself...and continue hating everyone else.,CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
One traverses the final path.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Oh, good choice. Well, good for me. I find everyone being out to get you so terribly entertaining. You might find it...less so. You see, Pelagius' mother was...well...let us say ""unique."" Although, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, she was fairly average for a Septim. That woman wielded fear like a cleaver. Or did she wield a cleaver and make people afraid? I never get that part right... Oh, but she taught her son well. Pelagius learned at a very young age that danger could come from anywhere. At any time. Delivered... by anyone.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
He finds a small arena where Pelly is fighting an atronach.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The objective here is simple, you simpleton! Use your Wabbajack to defeat the enemy, while they do the same!",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"The player transforms the fighters, then uses the 'Jack on some spectators, turning them into participants too.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Oho! I thought you'd never figure it out. With the threat gone, Pelagius is under the delusion that he is safe, which means you've helped him out...sort of. And we're that much closer to home.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"With all trials done, it's back to Sheogorath.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I've done it. I've fixed Pelagius' mind.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmmmm... ""Fixed"" is such a subjective term. I think ""treated"" is far more appropriate, don't you? Like one does to a rash, or an arrow in the face. Ah, but no matter. Heartless mortal that you are, you've actually succeeded and survived. I am forced to honor my end of the bargain. So congratulations! You're free to go! I... have been known to change my mind. So...go. Really.",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
The player goes to leave.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Pelagius Septim the III, once the Mad Emperor of Tamriel, now so boringly sane. I always knew he had it in him! Well, I suppose it's back to the Shivering Isles. The trouble Haskill can get into while I'm gone simply boggles the mind... Let's make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Clothes? Check. Beard? Check! Luggage? Luggage! Now where did I leave my luggage?",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
"The ""luggage,"" Dervenin, teleports in.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to...",CHARACTER,Dervenin,male
"Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
He teleports Dervenin out.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"And as for you, my little mortal minion... Feel free to keep the Wabbajack. As a symbol of my... Oh, just take the damn thing. You take care of yourself, now. And if you ever find yourself up in New Sheoth, do look me up. We can share a strawberry torte. Ha ha! Ta ta!",CHARACTER,Sheogorath,male
The player is teleported back to the Blue Palace.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Atop a mountain the Reach, one encounters Peryite's shrine. Kesh the Clean, a Khajiit acolyte, is the only one who lives here.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, a wanderer, yes? No? Pilgrim, perhaps? You have come to commune with Peryite, Taskmaster and blighted Lord, yes?",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
May I commune with Peryite?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not everyone has the stomach required to entreat my Lord. But Kesh likes you, friend. There is a way Peryite may speak to us who will take Him in. If you wish to commune with Him, we'll need the incense.",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
Tell me about this incense.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, the incense. Fetch for me a deathbell flower, one silver ingot, a flawless ruby, and some vampire dust. Then I will show you how.",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
Tell me about Peryite.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He is the pus in the wound. Oh, proper ones curl their noses, but it's pus that drinks foul humors and restores the blood. I worship Peryite, yes, because sometimes the world can only be cleansed by disease.",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
The player later returns with the ingredients.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have the items you requested.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, have you? Let Kesh have them. Yes, yes. This will create a fine fume.",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
He creates a batch of green liquid in a large dwarven container.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
That should do. Now -- inhale deeply.,CHARACTER,Kesh,male
"The player inhales and their vision blurs; they see strange colors all around. Rat familiars is crawling around, representing the Aspect of Peryite.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Breath deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
What do you want with me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have watched you for some time, you know. The decisions you've made intrigue me, and I wonder if you are the proper agent for a task of mine.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
What is this? Have I been poisoned?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In a sense, but no more poisoned than a fool after too much wine.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
What task?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I sent a blessing to Mundus, a wasting plague that infected a scattering of Breton villages. One of my monks, the elf Orchendor, was sent to gather these Afflicted. He shepherded them into Bhtardamz for me, but has since lost his way. I will not stand for betrayal. I want you to go to Bthardamz and kill Orchendor, in my name.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
What would I gain from this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The pettiness of mortals. I had almost forgotten. I can grant you a powerful token for this task. An escutcheon of Dwemer make, capable of shielding you from both the spell and sword. Return when the elf lies dead and it will be yours.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
Why does Orchendor deserve to die?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
An impertinent question. The elf must die. Either carry out my will or do not. You are not the only mortal agent I could choose.,CHARACTER,Peryite,male
I heard your request. Release me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So you have, mortal. Go now. Kill Orchendor.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
The gas evaporates. Kesh can be asked about the task.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Who is Orchendor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Orchendor? Kesh knew him. He's an Overseer. Shepherd. Gathers the Afflicted, contains the festering wound. Orchendor and his Afficted are meant to stand ready, awaiting Peryite's command to cover the world with his blessing.",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
Where is Bthardamz?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not far, not far. This one looks upon it on clear days. Look to the west, at the foot of the mountain. The Dwarven ruins there. Bthardamz.",CHARACTER,Kesh,male
"Orchendor is located deep within the forgotten city. After killing the man, one returns to Peryite.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
What happens now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Go, seek your fate. I will be watching, and perhaps we will meet again -- afterwards.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
What will become of the Afflicted?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Did you leave any alive? The Afflicted are mere vessels for my Blessing. It will spread to others through their touch and my own. Another Overseer will replace Orchendor, when the time comes. For now all is cleansed and ordered.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
I don't relish being a Daedra's puppet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And yet you have done my bidding. Why, I wonder?",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
Very well. Goodbye.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Embrace order and hard truth, mortal. Good bye.",CHARACTER,Peryite,male
"The player receives the Spellbreaker shield, which puts up a 50-point ward when blocking.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"When a certain level is reached, a courier delivers a notice about a museum when the player arrives.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Your ancestors wouldn't want this, Silus!",CHARACTER,Madena,female
Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!,CHARACTER,Silus,male
It's the past! Dead oaths on dead lips. Let it stay there.,CHARACTER,Madena,female
"The museum is opening, Madena.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
She walks off.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"And here comes my first visitor. The Museum of the Mythic Dawn is open, friend!",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Museum of the Mythic Dawn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Yes. My collection of artifacts from a group that toppled an Empire.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
What was that argument about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Never mind that. Madena is a good woman, but I have my own reasons for opening this museum, and I'm not changing my mind. I have a collection of artifacts from the group that toppled an Empire. Their importance to history cannot be forgotten. Why don't you come in? You can browse the displays, and we can talk. I have a job you look perfect for.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Sounds good.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Let's talk inside.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
Not interested.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your loss, but if you change your mind, I'll be here.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
His home is now partially renovated to show Mythic Dawn trinkets and curios.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Feel free to look around. Come talk to me when you're ready to discus that job I mentioned.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
"The player can look at the cases, drawing comments from the owner.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The tapestries hung here and outside were found in hideouts where members of the Mythic Dawn would meet and plot. The cult's greatest accomplishment was the assassination of the Septim Dynasty and the opening of the Oblivion Gates.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
"Those robes were worn during the Mythic Dawn's secret meetings, where they plotted to bring the Daedra Mehrunes Dagon into Tamriel. Each bolt of yarn used to make the robe was colored with a dye made from sacrificial blood.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
That burned paper is all that remains of the fabled Mysterium Xarxes. The blasphemous book written by Mehrunes Dagon himself. It's said that Mankar Camoran used the book to open a portal to a Paradise where all his followers would live forever.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
"The commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes were written by the Mythic Dawn cult leader, Mankar Camoran. He promised a paradise awaited his followers when they died, that they would be reborn by Mehrunes Dagon's side.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
"Ah, yes. That scabbard. Notice the insignia? An Oblivion Gate. A key symbol of Mehrunes Dagon, the patron Daedra of the Mythic Dawn.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
"Eventually, all the displays are observed.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Did you have any questions about the museum, or would you rather talk business?",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Let's talk about this job you want done.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A little history, first. After the Oblivion Crisis, a number of groups cropped up dedicated to wiping out the remnants of the Mythic Dawn. One of these groups found Mehrunes' Razor, the artifact of Dagon. They split it into three fragments and pledged to keep them apart forever. That was almost 150 years ago, and the pieces are still being kept by the descendants of that group. And they're right here, in Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
You want me to get those fragments?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"At least two of the owners, Ghunzul and Drascua, are dangerous marauders. And the third owner, Jorgen, I only know he lives in Morthal. Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Stop right there. I'm not interested.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine. I can't force you to help me, but the offer is open.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Why did you open this museum?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's no secret that my family were once members of the Mythic Dawn. One of my forefathers was even chosen to assassinate Uriel Septim himself. We hid from our past for years, became tradesmen, people of coin and influence. But I realized that the Mythic Dawn's importance -- our importance -- to history cannot be denied. I'll see everyone in Tamriel remember that for a moment, we held the fate of the world in our hands, for good or ill.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
So what is this Mythic Dawn cult?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They were worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Lord of Destruction and Change. The Mythic Dawn killed Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, triggering the events that lead to the Oblivion Crisis, when the Daedra invaded Tamriel. All that remains of the infamous cult, I've gathered in my museum.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Who is Mehrunes Dagon?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, an excellent question. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Lord of Change, Destruction, and Ambition. Dagon's Mythic Dawn cult killed the Septim Dynasty and opened the Oblivion Gates into Tamriel. They called it the Oblivion Crisis.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
I want to know more about the Razor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Razor is Mehrunes Dagon's personal artifact. It has always heralded bloody change and carnage. It's held many names: Dagger of Final Wounds, Bane of the Righteous, the Kingslayer. The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection. Good luck finding the fragments.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
The player gets two pieces from marauders. The third piece is held by a mill worker in Morthal.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm looking for pieces of Mehrunes' Razor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't know what you're talking about, stranger.",CHARACTER,Jorgen,male
Really? Silus Vesuius says otherwise.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true. I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generation keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house.",CHARACTER,Jorgen,male
"You won't miss it, then. (Persuade)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.,CHARACTER,Jorgen,male
I'll pay for the hilt. ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Divines know the mill could use some new blades. All right. It's yours. Here's the keys. It's locked in the chest inside my house.,CHARACTER,Jorgen,male
"Give me the hilt, or things get ugly. (Intimidate)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Easy. Here. These are the keys. The hilt is in a chest in my house, just don't hurt anyone.",CHARACTER,Jorgen,male
"Never mind, then.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Best leave the past buried, I say.",CHARACTER,Jorgen,male
The player revisits Silus after all pieces are reclaimed.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What is it? Do you have one of the Razor fragments?,CHARACTER,Silus,male
I have all the pieces of the Razor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
All at once! You're efficient. I like that. Here's your reward.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
"The hilt of Mehrunes' Razor, as promised.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Did you try the grip? Isn't it eerie how it seems to mold itself into your hand? Here's your gold.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
Here's the pommel stone of Mehrunes' Razor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Our master craftsman are nothing compared to the perfection of the Daedra. Look how it shines. Here's your gold, as promised.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
I have the blade shards of Mehrunes' Razor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Look at them. The legendary sharpness of the deadric weapon. Marvelous. And here's your payment for the shards.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
"If pieces are given over individually, Silus will have additional comments after each is given. They depend on the order delivered:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• We just need the hilt and pommel now. • We just need the shards of the blade and the hint, now. • We just need the pommel and the shards of the blade, now. • There's only the hilt left to collect. Exciting, isn't it? • There's only the pommel left to collect. Exciting, isnt it? • There's only the shards of the blade left to collect. Exciting, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Silus,male
After all are given...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Finally, all the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor are in my hands. It's time I let you in on something. There's a fourth piece. That scabbard in the display case. Built to house the Razor. And there's more. I know how to put all the pieces together. We just need to take them to Dagon's shrine and contact the Lord of Change directly.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
You think Dagon will repair the Razor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ever since I was a boy, I felt this strange sense of destiny surrounding the Mythic Dawn cult, and now I know what it is. Don't you see? Fate has led you to me and to the pieces. Dagon has to answer our call. We're so close. I'll meet you at the shrine.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
This sounds like a terrible idea...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You don't want to be part of history? Fine. I'll be at the shrine if you change your mind.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
"They find the Dagon shrine high up on a snowy peak, south of Dawnstar.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Good. You're here. I'll place the pieces on the altar, and Dagon should speak to us. Mehrunes Dagon, the Lord of Change, we have brought your Razor to you. We beg you, please bring the blade's full glory to Tamriel again! It's not working. Why don't you give it a try? Just put your hands on the altar.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Doing so causes Dagon's voice to ring out.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You. Mortal. You are worthy of speaking to. You have claimed the pieces of my Razor. It has been an amusing game to witness. But Dagon does not declare a winner while there is a pawn on the board. Kill Silus. He and his family have served their purpose.,CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
"It will be done, Lord Dagon.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you.",CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
He helped me find the pieces. He deserves to live.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Only Dagon can declare if a pawn is worth keeping. I. Have. Spoken. Kill him. Take your rightful place as my champion, or I will crush you.",CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
"Wait. Wait. Don't kill me. There's another way. I can take the pieces back to my museum. Seal them in a display case. You get a generous amount of gold, I get to complete my collection, and nobody has to die.",CHARACTER,Silus,male
Dagon has spoken.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Fine. I'm not dying without a fight!,CHARACTER,Silus,male
Fine. Get out of here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Thank you. Here's your gold. I'll make a run for it back to Dawnstar.,CHARACTER,Silus,male
If the player kills Silus:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I am pleased, mortal. I will give you my Razor. Use it to wreak havoc on Tamriel!",CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
"Thank you, Lord Dagon.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You have been a worthy tool. Fill the world with destruction in my name.,CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
"I will use the Razor as I see fit, Dagon.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Spare me your pitiful pride. You are but a tool for my ambitions, mortal. Never forget that. Place your hands on my altar one last time, and you will witness the power of Mehrunes Dagon for yourself.",CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
"When the reforged Razor is acquired, or Silus flees, the player must contend with summoned Dremora lackeys to fight. Dagon's parting shot will differ:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Before you go, mortal. One final challenge. Ha ha ha.",CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
You think to betray Mehrunes Dagon? Suffer!,CHARACTER,Mehrunes Dagon,male
"In Markarth, one learns the Hall of the Dead is closed, much to the city's chagrin. A priest, Brother Verulus, is arguing in Understone Keep.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"What are you hiding, priest?",CHARACTER,Thongvor,male
I'm not hiding anything. It's closed for a reason.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
"Typical Imperial lies. First you take away Talos, now you're keeping us from seeing our honored dead? You and the Jarl will answer for any desecration of my ancestors' bodies.",CHARACTER,Thongvor,male
"That's enough, Thongvor. We're done.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
Verulus goes to stand guard at the Hall's entrance.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"If it's about the Hall of the Dead, no, you can't go in there.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
Why not?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can't talk about it. Rest assured, the Jarl hears everyone's concerns. You will be able to visit the dead again soon.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
I could help if you tell me. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right. I was going to suggest the Jarl hire someone to sort this mess out, anyway.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
Would some coin help? ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, the Priesthood of Arkay always accepts generous donations.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
That's not going to work.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
I don't like being ignored. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then my answer is the Hall of the Dead is closed. By order of the Jarl. Understand?,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
"I'll come back later, then.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Arkay keep you and protect you.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
What's the Hall of the Dead?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"New to Skyrim? I was confused, too, at first. The Nords call their mausoleums the Hall of the Dead. It's where people in the city are buried. Fathers. Forefathers. Mothers. Foremothers.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
Who's Arkay?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Arkay. One of the Eight Divines. God of the Cycle of Birth and Death. It is his shrine people pray to when they visit the Hall. That his divinity will watch over their ancestors on the way to the next life.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
The player convinces the priest to discuss more.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We've discovered that some of the dead have been...eaten. Flesh has been chewed off, bones were snapped to get at the marrow inside. We haven't caught anyone or anything yet. It's like it knows when I'm there. If you can get to the bottom of this, the Priesthood of Arkay will reward you. Take my key and be careful... Tread lightly in the Hall. We don't know what's in there.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
The player enters the crypt within the dwemer ruins. A voice rings out.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Not many would walk blindly into a crypt, smelling of steel and blood, but not fear. I feel the hunger inside of you. Gnawing at you. You see the dead and your mouth grows wet. Your stomach growls. It's all right. I will not shun you for what you are. Stay. I will tell you everything you have forgotten.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
Soon a woman runs up.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You were young when you first tasted human flesh, weren't you? A brother or sister had died? An accident, of course. Then the hunger set in. Curiosity. What's the harm in just one bite? It's okay, now. You've found a friend who understands you. You can let go of your guilt. Guilt? What are you talking about?",CHARACTER,Eola,female
I'm not a cannibal. What are you trying to do to me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore. Namira, the Lady of Decay, accepts you for what you are. She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetite without judgment.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
Where is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's inside Reachcliff Cave. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here. Meet me there. We will fight our way to Namira's embrace together. Until then, tell the people of Markarth that their dead won't be disturbed, anymore. We have bigger plans ahead.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
I want no part of this.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very well. But should the hunger call out to you, I'll be waiting outside Reachcliff Cave. Tell the people of Markarth that their dead are safe. My work is done here.",CHARACTER,Eola,female

You've returned. What happened in the Hall of the Dead?,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
Your cannibal has been taken care of.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I don't need to know the details. Blessings of Arkay to you for your help. The Hall of the Dead is now safe.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male

Just tell me who needs to die.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A priest, filled with the taste of an easy life. Brother Verulus, from Markarth. Give him this gold. Tell him you need Arkay's help exploring an old cavern for treasure. And when he stands in Namira's presence, she will take care of the rest. Say hello to Verulus for me.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
"One returns to the rump roast...err, priest.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have need of a priest in my travels.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You are looking for Arkay's protection while you delve some dank tomb, I take it? My duties keep me busy in Markarth. I don't know if I can help you.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
There would be treasure to share... (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Treasure, you say? I suppose the Jarl won't mind if I'm gone for a little while. Lead on.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
"You know, in the Priesthood of Arkay, we have a joke about an empty pocket being better than a full grave.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
I'm willing to pay. ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's no small amount of coin, friend. I suppose I can come with you for a short adventure. Lead on.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
"I'm just not up for it, sorry. I'd rather stay here, have a glass of wine, and perform my rites to Arkay in peace.",CHARACTER,Verulus,male
You're coming with me. Now. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I think you need to calm down before I summon the guards.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
"Never mind, then.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Arkay watch over you.,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
"They return to Namira's shrine. In the short time the player's been gone, the Red-Arm, Nimphaneth, Sanyon, Lisbet -- are waiting for the cannibal feast.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Who... who are you? What's going on?,CHARACTER,Verulus,male
Priest of Arkay. I'm your friend.,CHARACTER,Eola,female
"Yes. I'm your friend, and I've invited you to dinner.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
"Why don't you lay down and rest, while we get the meal ready?",CHARACTER,Eola,female
Come with me. Our feast is about to begin.,CHARACTER,Eola,female
"The player can talk to the other citizens before proceeding, which reveals how cannibalism has secretly informed their lifestyles.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm so glad Eola invited you to dinner.,CHARACTER,Lisbet,female
Wait. I know you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
One of my customers? Did you know I inherited the store from my late husband? Shame what happened to him. He had such good taste.,CHARACTER,Lisbet,female
I remember my first feast. I envy you.,CHARACTER,Banning,male
Wait. I know you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, yes. The courier. I guess you know my secret ingredient for that spiced beef, now.",CHARACTER,Banning,male
Now this is going to be a good feast.,CHARACTER,Hogni Red-Arm,male
Wait. I know you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"""The bloodiest beef in the Reach!"" Ha ha ha.",CHARACTER,Hogni Red-Arm,male
You've brought us quite the meal.,CHARACTER,Nimphaneth,female
"Ah, the new disciple. I hear you have quite the appetite.",CHARACTER,Sanyon,male
The player goes over to where Eola has led the hypnotized priest.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The meal is on Namira's table. Go ahead. Carve.,CHARACTER,Eola,female
"As instructed, the player kills Verulus.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
He looks so...sweet. Go ahead. Have the first bite.,CHARACTER,Eola,female
Brother Verulus's still warm body lies before you.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The player eats. This elicits a chat with the Daedric Lord herself.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Mortal. I am Namira, the Lady of Decay. Your consumption of the blood and bile of Arkay's own is pleasing to me. I give you my ring. Wear it, and when you feast on the flesh of the death, I will grant you my power.",CHARACTER,Namira,female
"Thank you, my Lady.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Wallow in your wretchedness, my newest champion.",CHARACTER,Namira,female
That's a lot of work for such a little thing...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your mockery will be the end of you. And on that day, another servant will feast on your entrails and discover a ring clenched in her teeth. Be grateful for what time I give you until then.",CHARACTER,Namira,female
I knew when you walked into the Hall of the Dead that you were special. And here you are. Champion of Namira. Keeper of her ring. You're everything I hoped you would be.,CHARACTER,Eola,female
"Thank you, Eola. For everything.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's an honor, Champion. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
I feel sick.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There, there. It will pass. Going too long without a proper meal can make the stomach weak. Feel free to stay and mingle with your new coven, if you have the strength.",CHARACTER,Eola,female
You started the coven of Namira?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No. This coven has existed for thousands of years. Namira is a goddess. She has been worshipped since time began. I'm honored to be leading the latest generation of Namira's faithful. Those who have embraced what they are.,CHARACTER,Eola,female
"The city of Dawnstar is having trouble sleeping, and eventually, one learns a talking with villagers.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
It's a curse! It has to be! I've got to get out of this town.,CHARACTER,Irgnir,female
"Irgnir, get a hold of yourself. They're just dreams. Please tell her, Erandur.",CHARACTER,Fruki,female
"Listen to your friend, Fruki. They are just dreams, my dear. I assure you that it is quite normal.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
It's the same dream over and over. You think that's normal? It's evil I tell you!,CHARACTER,Irgnir,female
"Erandur, she has a point. You keep telling us no harm will follow these dreams, but they must be an omen.",CHARACTER,Fruki,female
Give him a chance to speak. He's trying to help us.,CHARACTER,Thoring,male
"Everyone, please. I'm doing what I can to end these nightmares. In the meantime all I ask is you remain strong and put your trust in Lady Mara.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
I...I will. Thank you...,CHARACTER,Irgnir,female
The player approaches.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"What troubles you, my son?",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
What's wrong with everyone around here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"What could you do, anyway? Dreams aren't real.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"These dreams are manifestations created by the Daedric Lord Vaermina. She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares not unlike a cough marks a serious illness. I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Don't be ridiculous. Dreams are harmless.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In any other circumstance, I'd agree with you. However, these aren't normal dreams. The Daedric Lord Vaermina's voracious hunger for memories is responsible for these visions. The nightmares are an echo of her presence as she feeds.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Then leave. This isn't your problem.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Turn my back on these people when their lives could be at stake? I should say not. Those dreams are not just visions, they're a footprint left by the Daedric Lord Vaermina as she drains these people of their memories!",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
What's your plan?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple. Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard?",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"What do you mean, ""return""? You've been there?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic. I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's problems.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
I trust you. How can I help?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Wonderful! My lady Mara will be quite pleased! Nightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
I can't trust you. You're hiding something.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Your concerns are understandable; trust is a very difficult commodity to come by these days. I can only give you my word as a Priest of Mara that my intentions are honorable.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"Sorry, I can't.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I understand. If you should change your mind, I'll be here.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Who is the Daedric Lord Vaermina?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Vaermina resides in a strange realm known as Quagmire...a nightmarish land where reality shifts upon itself in seemingly impossible ways. From her citadel at the center, she reaches forth to collect our memories, leaving nothing in return apart from visions of horror and despair.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
What does she do with the memories?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Who can say? Perhaps she collects them for display like works of art in a nonsensical art gallery. Whatever the case may be, her intentions are far from benevolent. I promise to answer all of your questions. Follow me.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
The two walk outside. The destination looms on a nearby cliff.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Follow me, it's this way. It feels good to finally have a chance to help these people. Helplessly watching them suffer's been difficult. The tower on that hill is our destination. People around here call it the Tower of the Dawn. I'm not familiar with the tower's history, but it was deserted for quite a long time before Nightcaller Temple was established inside. When the temple was active the priests would rarely be seen in Dawnstar. They preferred to live a solitary existence. The temple's been abandoned for decades now. Ironic isn't it...a ruin within a ruin? There's a small shrine to Mara I established inside the tower's entry hall. I was hoping to seek spiritual guidance from Her.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They arrive outside the temple.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Before we enter, I must warn you about the dangers that could be lurking within. Years ago, this temple was raided by an orc war party seeking revenge...they were being plagued by nightmares just like the people of Dawnstar.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Were they successful?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. Knowing they could never defeat the orcs, the priests of Vaermina released what they call ""The Miasma,"" putting everyone to sleep.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Why is it dangerous if they're asleep?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm concerned that when this place is unsealed, the Miasma will dissipate and they'll awaken; both orcs and priests alike.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
What does the Miasma do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Miasma was created by the priests of Vaermina for their rituals. It's a gas that places the affected in a deep sleep. Because the rituals would last for months or even years, the Miasma was designed to slow down the aging process.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Is the gas dangerous?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sadly, yes. The longer an individual is exposed to the Miasma, the more the mind can become damaged. Those who've been under the effect of it for extended periods of time have been known to lose their minds entirely. In some cases, a few never awoke at all. Once we get inside, all will become clear.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They enter the vestibule.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Give me just a moment, and I'll have this open.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"He burns part of the wall, revealing the sealed portion of the temple.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Now I can show you the source of the nightmares. Over here.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"At the bottom of the temple, they spy Vaermina's relic still active after the last few decades.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Behold the Skull of Corruption, the source of Dawnstar's woes. We must reach the inner sanctum and destroy it. Come, there's no time to lose.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"In the stairwell, only to find a mystical barrier blocking passage downward.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Damn it. The priests must have activated this barrier when the Miasma was released.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Looks difficult to breach.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Impossible actually. Hmm, I wonder... There may be a way to bypass the barrier, but I must check their library and confirm it can be done.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
You seem to know an awful lot about this place.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I suppose there's no point in concealing the truth any longer. My knowledge of this temple comes from personal experience. I was a priest of Vaermina.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Why keep it a secret?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"When the orcs invaded the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters here to die.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
You should have told me the truth.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, you're right. I should have, but I didn't know what to say. When the orcs raided the temple, I fled. I left my brothers and sisters behind to die.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
I knew it! You're a liar!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"And what would you have me say? Sorry for following the misguided teachings of a mad Divine? Sorry for stealing memories from children? Do you realize when the orcs attacked, I was only concerned for myself? I fled...and left my brothers and sisters behind to die. I've spent the last few decades living in regret and seeking redemption from Mara. And by Her Benevolence, I will right my wrongs.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
All right. I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I still have my key to the library. Whenever you're ready, let's move on.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
How can the Skull be affecting Dawnstar?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Lore holds that the Skull of Corruption holds a constant hunger for the memories of others. The Skull has been out of touch for so long, I fear it's gained the ability to reach out on its own and try to feed. What it does with these memories is just conjecture and an argument for scholars and historians to this very day. We mustn't tarry...the Skull needs to be destroyed as soon as possible.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They head back upstairs.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
It's just up here. Be careful...we're certain to find more of the awakened within.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They unlock the library...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This library used to be filled with arcane volumes. Now look at it; almost everything's been burned. I hope the tome we need is still intact.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
...and clear out the Miasma-addled sleepyheads.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Barring any more interruptions, perhaps we can locate the information I need.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
What am I looking for?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We're looking for a book of alchemical recipes called ""The Dreamstride."" The tome bears the likeness of Vaermina on the cover. It should be here somewhere.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
It's on a pedestal upstairs.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Found it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Let me take a look... Mara be praised! There is a way past the barrier to the inner sanctum. It involves a recipe for a liquid known as Vaermina's Torpor.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Is that some kind of potion?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. The Torpor grants an ability the priests of Vaermina called ""The ""Dreamstride""; using dreams to travel distances in the real world.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
That's impossible.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I assure you, the Dreamstride is well known in Vaerminian Lore.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
That's amazing!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Quite amazing, yes. Alchemy and the blessings of a Divine distilled down into an ingestible liquid. Sadly, I have yet to see it function in person.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"I'm going to be the test subject, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As a sworn priest of Mara, the elixir won't work for me. The Torpor will only work for Priests or Vaermina, or the unaffiliated.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Sounds dangerous. How can you be sure?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I will not lie to you, there is some risk involved. The last time the Torpor was imbibed could have been decades ago. But I swear upon Lady Mara that I will do everything within my power to prevent any harm from befalling you.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Forget it! It could kill me!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, all my research points in the opposite direction. This is the exact liquid the priests would drink. The only question in my mind is whether you will be granted The Dreamstride. Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a bad aftertaste. I swear upon Lady Mara that I would never let any harm befall you.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Do you know where we can find the Torpor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I believe there is a laboratory in the east wing. If we proceed there, we should be able to locate a sample. The laboratory adjoins the library. I'm hoping we'll find a sample of the Torpor left undamaged.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
The player can inquire further...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What will the Dreamstride feel like?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'll be viewing the memory of another through your own eyes and with your own body. Those around you will perceive you as normal and you will find the words you utter may not be your own. Thanks to all of these odd principles, there is quite a lot of debate about whether this is really a dream or just the machinations of Vaermina.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
How will I know when to awaken?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I will watch over you as you slumber to ensure your safety. If I deduce anything is amiss, I will use my arts to bring you back. Otherwise, I am uncertain what will end your Dreamstride. Perhaps when Vaermina's curious appetite has been filled.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They clear out the lab.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now that they've been dealt with, we need to find the Torpor.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
How will I know what it looks like?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It should be in a small bottle, very similar to a potion. I'll begin searching up here. The Torpor should be in a tall bottle with a dark liquid. If you find it, bring it to me.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
The Torpor is on a shelf nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I found the Torpor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm relieved you found a bottle intact; this place looks as though it were ransacked by the orcs. So...I've taken us this far, but you need to guide us the rest of the way. Drink.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Here? Now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Dawnstar's fate rests in that tiny bottle. The longer we wait, the more damage Vaermina could be doing to those poor people. I understand your hesitation, but I promise you that it works.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"The player drinks and sees through the eyes of a priest, decades earlier, stand near the Skull of Corruption.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The orcs have breached the inner sanctum, Brother Veren.",CHARACTER,Thorek,male
We must hold. We can't allow the Skull to fall into their hands.,CHARACTER,Veren,male
"But...no more than a handful of us remain, brother.",CHARACTER,Thorek,male
Then we have no choice. The Miasma must be released.,CHARACTER,Veren,male
"The Miasma? But, brother...",CHARACTER,Thorek,male
"We have no alternative. It's the will of Vaermina. And what about you, Brother Casimir? Are you prepared to serve the will of Vaermina?",CHARACTER,Veren,male
I've made my peace. I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"Then it's decided. Brother Casimir, you must activate the barrier and release the Miasma. Let nothing stop you. Brother Thorek, we must remain here and guard this Skull with our lives, if necessary.",CHARACTER,Veren,male
Agreed. To the death.,CHARACTER,Thorek,male
"Then let it be done. Farewell, my brothers!",CHARACTER,Veren,male
"As Casimir, the player bolts upstairs through the fighting, pulling the chain the Torpor has indeed worked as it should. The barrier is deactivated.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
It...it worked. Mara be praised! You vanished after drinking the Torpor and materialized on the other side. I've never seen anything quite like it.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
It was remarkable... As if I were really there.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"How I envy you. I can only imagine the excitement of seeing history through the eyes of another! Sadly, I am resigned to just reading of its wonders through my research of the Skull.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
It served a purpose.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"After what you just experienced, are you not amazed? I am at a loss for words.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Are you mad? I could have died!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I thought I was clear regarding the dangers that awaited you within the Dreamstride. However, this hardly matters any longer as you appear to have exited unscathed.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
We can discuss it later. We need to proceed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Indeed. My reverence for Vaermina's machinations should not take precedence over our mission. My apologies. The inner sanctum lies ahead. We must reach the Skull and put an end to Dawnstar's troubles. Lead on, my friend.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They reach the final room. Thorek and Veren appear.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Veren...Thorek...you're alive!,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"No thanks to you, Casimir.",CHARACTER,Veren,male
"I no longer use that name. I'm Erandur, Priest of Mara.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
You're a traitor. You left us to die and ran before the Miasma took you.,CHARACTER,Veren,male
No. I...I was scared. I wasn't ready to sleep.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"Enough of your lies! I can't allow you to destroy the Skull, Priest of Mara.",CHARACTER,Veren,male
Then you leave me no choice!,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
They kill the two.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"How could you, Erandur...",CHARACTER,Veren,male
They walk to,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Vaermina speaks to the player's mind after the barrier is removed.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"He's deceiving you. When the ritual's complete, the Skull will be free and then Erandur will turn on you. Quickly! Kill him now. Kill him and claim the Skull for your own! Vaermina commands you!",CHARACTER,Vaermina,female
"The player can kill Erandur and take the Skull, but there's no extra chatting the Skull is destroyed.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Forgive me if I don't appear relieved...this temple has taken its toll on me.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Are you going to be all right?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In time, I believe I will.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"So we're done, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Yes. The Skull has been destroyed and Dawnstar is safe.,CHARACTER,Erandur,male
How about some compensation?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Being a humble servant of Mara, I have little in the way of gold or coin, but perhaps I could offer you something better...companionship. I'd constructed a meager shrine to Mara in the antechamber where we entered. My intention was to spend the rest of my years here, burying the past and praying for forgiveness. But instead, I wish to offer my services to you. If you ever with to journey with me, I'll be here.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
Thank you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There's no need to thank me. What you did was for the people of Dawnstar. If anyone should be thanked, it should be you.",CHARACTER,Erandur,male
"In Whiterun, the player overhears a rumor from the Bannered Mare barkeep.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Been hearing some strange tales of the Jarl's children. Say the one's turning wicked, and the others have an ill-favored look to them. Best to keep clear.",CHARACTER,Hulda,female
Jarl Balgruuf is spoken to on the matter.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I heard there's trouble with your children.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, my youngest son. He's a dark child. I don't know what to do with him. He was always a quiet lad, but lately...something has changed. He's become brooding. Violent. He won't say a word to me, but I don't know how I upset him. If you could speak with him. Draw out the truth. I would be immensely grateful.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"The son, Nelkir, is nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Your father said to speak to you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So the disgusting pig sent you to bother me? One day, I'll tear his face apart so he can leave me alone. My father doesn't know anything about me. But I know about him. And about the war. More than he might think.",CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
What sorts of things?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I know that he still worships Talos. That he hates the Thalmor almost as much as the Stormcloaks do. That he worries about being chased from Whiterun. That he...that I'm...that I don't have the same mother as my brother and sister.,CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
How do you know these things?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
This castle is old. Lots of places nobody's been in a long while. Places where you can overhear things. See things. And the Whispering Lady.,CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
Who's the Whispering Lady?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She won't tell me her name. I've gotten good at listening to keyholes. At the door in the basement, I hear her talking to me. I thought I was caught, but she started telling me even more secrets. But I can't open the door.",CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
Where is this door?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In the basement. Trust me, you'll see it. I bet she'll talk to you, too.",CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
"One searches the pantry, finding a half-hidden door near the shelves, faded with age. One tries to open it; a woman's voice speaks from beyond.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
(Listen at the door),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"At last. I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will. The child is spirited, but lacks...agency.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
Is there someone behind the door?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Regrettably, I cannot reach your plane so directly. But I forgive you for not knowing who I am. Few hear my whispers anymore. I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers. I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal. The boy was good at sussing out secrets. You, I expect to take a more active role.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
What could the boy not do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The boy is good at sussing out secrets, but the corruptibility of children is ultimately too limited for my purposes. You, though, I expect will prove far more malleable.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
Who are you to expect anything?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I forgive your not knowing my name. Few can hear my whispers anymore. I am Mephala, the Lady of Whispers. I tug at the web of connections between mortals. Love, hatred, loyalty, betrayal.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
I'm not so easily molded.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You may think so. But in the end, you mortals will always flit like fire with the winds of your desires and conveniences. And those winds issue from my whispers.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
What do you want me to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"First, you must open this door. A piece of my power has been locked away behind it, and even my eyes cannot see past the seals. I'd much rather it be in the hands of an ambitious and talented person such as yourself.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
I don't want to help you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Suit yourself. But those who listen at doors always wonder what is beyond them. Eventually your curiosity will drive you back to me.,CHARACTER,Mephala,female
How do I open the door?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The whole of Whiterun is ripe with paranoia and tensions. The Jarl's court is right to fear the power I hold behind this door. The Jarl trusts few, and they will be his undoing. The dark child knows of what I speak. Let him guide your path.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
Nelkir is sought out again.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You...you know the Whispering Lady, don't you. I can tell.",CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
Do you know how to open the Whispering Door?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I told you, I know everything about this castle. For some reason that door is special. Only two people can open it, Balgruuf and Farengar, the court wizard. How you get it from them is up to you. Nobody would notice if Farengar went missing, I promise you.",CHARACTER,Nelkir,male
"After getting the key, one returns to the door. Behind it is a small room the blade. The Dragonborn picks it up.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Excellent work. Now, I trust you're sharp enough to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know. It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal. To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit. Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master. Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in a song of your grandeur.",CHARACTER,Mephala,female
"Through many means, usually overhearing, one can learn that Aventus Aretino, repeating the rites/mantra:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
The player goes over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You've come at last! I knew you would!,CHARACTER,Aventus,male
Are you all right?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It worked! I knew you'd come, I just knew it! I did the Black Sacrament, over and over! With the body, and the...things. And then you came! An assassin from the Dark Brotherhood!",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
"I'm sorry, boy, but I'm not who you think I am.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course you are! I prayed, and you came, and now you'll accept my contract!",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
"Yes, of course... The Black Sacrament...",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It took so long. So very long. But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You don't have to say anything. There's no need. You're here, so I know you'll accept my contract.",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
Contract?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My mother, she...she died. I...I'm all alone now. So they sent me to that terrible orphanage in Riften. Honorhall. The headmistress is an evil, cruel woman. They call her Grelod the Kind. But he's not kind. She's terrible. To all of us. So I ran away, and came home. And performed the Black Sacrament. Now you're here! And you can kill Grelod the Kind! • Please don't kill Constance Michel! She really is kind. • Please hurry! To be honest, I'm kind of lonely here. As much as I hated getting sent to Honorhall, I really miss my friends there...",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
If Grelod is already dead:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Grelod? As it turns out...I already killed her.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You did? Really? This is the best news I've ever gotten! I mean, I knew the Dark Brotherhood was good...just not that good! You killed the old hag before I even asked! Oh, and please, take this as payment. It's an old family heirloom, supposed to be pretty valuable. It should fetch you a nice price. Thank you again!",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
If Grelod is alive and one inquires further...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Grelod is the headmistress of Honorhall Orphanage. But not for long.,CHARACTER,Aventus,male
"Assassinations don't come cheap, boy.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I have a family heirloom you can have. Supposed to be sort of valuable. I hope that's all right.,CHARACTER,Aventus,male
Tell me about your mother. What happened?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She got sick, last winter, when the snows came. And she just...she never got better. Not all year. One night she just fell asleep and... never woke up. So now I'm all alone. And the Jarl said I had to go to Honorhall Orphanage. It's not fair!",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
"Are you sure about this, boy? Murdering this woman?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Someone like Grelod doesn't deserve to live one more day. She's a monster.,CHARACTER,Aventus,male
The player travels to Riften and enters the orphanage. Grelod is yelling at her young wards in the main room.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?,CHARACTER,Grelod,female
"Yes, Grelod.",CHARACTER,Kids,neutral
"And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Ever! Nobody needs you, nobody wants you. That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you will always be here, until the day you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world. Now, what do you all say?",CHARACTER,Grelod,female
"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.",CHARACTER,Kids,neutral
"That's better. Now scurry off, my little guttersnipes.",CHARACTER,Grelod,female
The player walks over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What do you want? You have no business being here.,CHARACTER,Grelod,female
"The Dark Brotherhood has come, Grelod.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The what? Why how dare you! I will not be intimidated in my own orphanage! Get out! Get out this instant!,CHARACTER,Grelod,female
Aventus Aretino says hello.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aretino? Why that little bastard! You tell him I'm coming for him! And when I find him, it will be the beating of his miserable life!",CHARACTER,Grelod,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What are you staring at, you worthless piece of gutter trash? I simply must start locking the doors again...",CHARACTER,Grelod,female
You don't scare me.,CHARACTER,Grelod,female
"You're trying to frighten me, hmm? Do your worst!",CHARACTER,Grelod,female
Think you can intimidate me? In my own orphanage? Ha! Not bloody likely.,CHARACTER,Grelod,female
"The player kills Grelod, delighting the oppressed orphans. Examples:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Someone has killed Grelod! Ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Hroar,male
Grelod is dead! Aventus did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Runa,female
Hooray! Grelod the Kind is dead at last! We're saved!,CHARACTER,Samuel,male
Yay!,CHARACTER,Francois,male
The player returns to Aventus.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well? Grelod the Kind. Is she...you know?,CHARACTER,Aventus,male
Grelod the Kind is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aha! I knew you could do it! I just knew it! I knew the Dark Brotherhood would save me! Here, just like I promised! This should fetch you a nice price. And thank you. Thank you again.",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
Aventus says some funny things if spoken to again.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'll go back to the Orphanage in a while. I'll give them time to, you know...clean up the mess.",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
"When I grow up, I'm going to be an assassin. That way I can help lots of children, just like you!",CHARACTER,Aventus,male
"After completing Innocence Lost, then sleeping, the player will wake up in a shelf, watching the protagonist.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Sleep well?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What? Where am I? Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Does it matter? You're warm, dry...and still very much alive. That's more than can be said for old Grelod. Hmm?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
You know about that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Half of Skyrim knows. Old hag gets butchered in her own orphanage? Things like that tend to get around. Oh, but don't misunderstand. I'm not criticizing. It was a good kill. Old crone had it coming. And you saved a group of urchins, to boot. Ah, but there is a slight...problem. A problem? (Remain silent)",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
I don't think I like where this is going...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You see, that little Aretino boy was looking for the Dark Brotherhood. For me, and my associates. Grelod the Kind was, by all rights, a Dark Brotherhood contract. A kill...that you stole. A kill you must repay.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
You want me to murder someone else? Who?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well now. Funny you should ask. If you turn around, you'll notice my guests. I've ""collected"" them from...well, that's not really important. The here and now. That's what matters. You see, there's a contract out on one of them, and that person can't leave this room alive. But... which one? Go on, see if you can figure it out. Make your choice. Make your kill. I just want to observe...and admire.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
I'll have no part of this insanity.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that is a shame. But what you fail to realize is that you involved yourself in this ""insanity"" when you took Grelod's life. You made your choice. Now it's time to face the consequences of your actions. You don't leave this shack until someone dies.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"All right, I'll do it. I'll kill one of them.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"See, I knew we could resolve this civilly. A debt owed must be repaid. You understand that. Well, get to it then. Pick your guest, and send the poor fool to the Void. I'll give you the key to this shack, and you'll be on your way.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Am I to take your silence as acceptance? Then you know where we stand. Make your kill, and we're square. Repayment of your debt is but a discreet knife thrust away.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"If the player lets the option time out, or tries to exit dialogue, instead:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'll cut right to it. You murdered the old woman in the Orphanage. You owe the Dark Brotherhood a kill. I've come to collect. One of these poor sods has a contract out on their life. Which one is it? Any idea? Make your choice. Make your kill. And you get to walk away.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"The player can talk to the three bound, gagged individuals nearby: Vasha, Alea Quintus and Fultheim the Fearless.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Whoever this is, clearly we got off on the wrong foot. Ah, but no worries. This is not the first time I have been bagged and dragged. Come now. Whatever the problem, we can talk about it like civilized folk, hmm?",CHARACTER,Vasha,male
Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ahhh...Vasha, at your service. Obtainer of goods, taker of lives, and defiler of daughters. Have you not heard of me? Perhaps I will have my people carve my name into your corpse, as a reminder.",CHARACTER,Vasha,male
Would someone pay to have you killed?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Me? Ha! Are you serious?,CHARACTER,Vasha,male
"Answer me, or I'll paint this room with your blood! (Intimidate)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fool! Don't you get it? I live in the shadow of death every day. A knife in the doorway, a nocked arrow on every rooftop! If one of my enemies wouldn't pay to have me killed, I would take it as a personal insult.",CHARACTER,Vasha,male
"Come on, you can tell me. We're all friends here. (Persuade)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He he he he he he. The real question is, ""Would someone pay to have me killed...again."" A day goes by without someone trying to gut me in the street, I get disappointed. Tell you what. You release me, and I promise my associates won't hunt you down like an animal and butcher you in the street. It is a win-win.",CHARACTER,Vasha,male
Get these things off me! Cowards! Stealing a woman from her home! For shame!,CHARACTER,Alea,female
Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"None of your damned business who I am! If you're going to kill me, just do it already! As Mara as my witness, if I didn't have this hood on right now I would spit right in your face...",CHARACTER,Alea,female
Would someone pay to have you killed?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Excuse me? What kind of question is that?,CHARACTER,Alea,female
One last time: Would. Someone. Pay. To. Have. You. Killed? (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm kneeling here with my hands bound and a sack over my head, and you have the gall to ask me that? What do you think, genius?",CHARACTER,Alea,female
It's all right. Just tell me what I need to know.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband. I don't have the time or the patience to be ""nice"". Do some people look down on me? Have I made some enemies? You're damn right. I don't have time for this nonsense. I've got a home to keep and children to feed. Now let me out of here!",CHARACTER,Alea,female
"I...I can hear you talking out there. Please, let me go. I've done nothing to you. Is this about that raid last week? I told Holgrim there was no honor in killing sleeping men, but he wouldn't listen! It wasn't my fault, I swear!",CHARACTER,Fultheim,male
Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My name is Fultheim. I'm a soldier. Well, mercenary, really. You know, a...a sellsword. I've lived in Skyrim all my life. That's all! I'm a nobody, really. So can't you just let me go?",CHARACTER,Fultheim,male
Would someone pay to have you killed?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? Oh gods, I don't want to die...",CHARACTER,Fultheim,male
"Answer me, or die! (Intimidate)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Please! I don't know! I mean, I'm a soldier. I've killed people. When I was ordered to. Maybe there were some times...some times I got carried away? But war is war. Right? Nobody could blame me for that. Could they?",CHARACTER,Fultheim,male
Shhh... Don't be afraid. You can tell me. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay, well...I guess it's possible. I've been selling my sword arm for years now. Killed a lot of people. Could be someone wanted revenge. But... But you're not going to kill me. Right? What did I do? Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry.",CHARACTER,Fultheim,male
"If the player chooses to kill one or more victims, Astrid will comment on the chosen victims. Seven responses total.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• Oh ho. The whimpering Nord, eh? Yes, yes, I can see how you'd come to that conclusion. Interesting choice. • Ah, the feisty goodwife. Quite the mouth on her. Someone must have wanted her dead... right? • The conniving Khajiit. Cat like that was sure to have enemies. It's no wonder you chose him. • The blubbering barbarian and the tenacious mother. Must have been one of them, right? • Hmm. The fearless wife and mother, and the underhanded Khajiit. Had to be one of them, right? Interesting choice. • The timid warrior and the sly Khajiit. Must have been one or the other, right? • Well, well, aren't we the overachiever? Three possibilities, three victims. Must have been one of them, right? So why take chances...",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So who was it? Who had the contract?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh. No, no, no. Don't you understand? Guilt, innocence, right, wrong... Irrelevant. What matters is I ordered you to kill someone, and you obeyed.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"You told me to kill, and I killed.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Indeed. For you, my friend, seem to understand what's truly important. When I give an order to spill blood, you follow it. No questions. No remorse.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. When most would speak, you listen. You think. You understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders. To kill.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So...I'm free to go?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course. And you've repaid your debt, in full. Here's the key to the shack. But why stop here? I say we take our relationship to the next level. I would like to officially extend to you an invitation to join my Family. The Dark Brotherhood. In the southwest region of Skyrim, in the Pine Forest, you'll find the entrance to our Sanctuary. It's just beneath the road, hidden from view. When questioned by the Black Door, answer with the correct passphrase: ""Silence, my brother."" Then you're in. And your new life begins. I'll see you at home.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"If the player killed Astrid instead of a gagged victim, she gives a line before the quest fails and ""Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!"" begins.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well done...,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Eventually, the player enters the Sanctuary. Astrid is waiting.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, at last. I hope you found the place all right.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So what happens now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, what happens now is you start your new life in the Dark Brotherhood. You're part of the Family, after all. This, as you can see, is our Sanctuary. You won't find a safer place in all of Skyrim. So get comfortable.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"I am honored to be part of your Family, Astrid.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Our Family, my dearest. Our Family. Together, united as one, the Dark Brotherhood can accomplish anything. But you must be anxious to get to work. I'm arranging a job, but need a bit more time. For now, go see Nazir. He's got several smaller contracts.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
When do I get to kill someone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Soon, my dearest. Soon. I'm arranging a job for you, but I need some more time. For now, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmmm... Yes, the silence suits you. Gives you an air of mystery. Now, down to business. I'm arranging a job for you. But in the meantime, go talk to Nazir. He may have some smaller contracts to tide you over. Soon, the Night Mother will arrive. And things around here are sure to get even more interesting. Ah, but one last thing. A welcome home present. The armor of the Dark Brotherhood. May it serve you well in all your...endeavors.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Who is the Night Mother?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Unholy Matron, the Shrouded Lady, the Mistress of the Void. She goes by many names. Ages past, Sithis gave a woman five children. She killed them to win his favor, thus becoming the Night Mother. If you believe that sort of thing. Today, she's...well, she's a skeleton. An ancient corpse. But, more importantly, a corpse that's being brought to this Sanctuary by her Keeper.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So the Night Mother is being brought here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. A few months ago I received word from the Night Mother's Keeper that he had arrived in Skyrim from Cyrodiil. The Night Mother's crypt, in Bravil, was destroyed. A result of the chaos caused by the war with the Thalmor. That forced a relocation. I don't know where the Keeper has been these past few months, but I recently received another letter. He's bringing the Night Mother here. Soon.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What if I get caught killing someone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Try not to? But I do realize sometimes it's not that easy. You may want to make a statement, or a contract may require a public killing. Murder is, obviously, a very serious crime, and a very high bounty will be put on your head in the hold where the act was committed. You can run, obviously, but you'll still have a price on your head. If a guard attacks, you can attempt to yield by sheathing your weapon. If the guard accepts, you can serve your time in a cell, or pay off your bounty. We've all gone through it. We do what we must to survive. But, there is another option. Some members of the Thieves Guild in Riften can get their bounties...erased. For a price. Something to think about.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Where do the contracts come from?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They used to come from the Night Mother. Potential clients would perform the Black Sacrament, and she would hear their prayers. The Night Mother would communicate this to the Listener, who would then dispatch a Speaker to arrange the contract with the client. But that was a long time ago. There hasn't been a Listener in years, not since Cyrodiil was overrun in the war with the Thalmor. But people don't know that. So they still perform the ritual...and we eventually hear about it. When someone wants us, we find out.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Are there any rules I should be aware of?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Used to be the Dark Brotherhood was bound by Five Tenets, but we stopped following those years ago. All those rules, all that discipline, and look where the Dark Brotherhood ended up. We're the last of our kind, and we live the way we see fit. Bottom line -- respect your Family. Do that, and everything else will fall into place.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This Sanctuary has been my entire life since I was a young woman. That's when I discovered my, shall we call it ""aptitude,"" for elimination. I had an uncle, you see. He made certain...unwanted advances. So I killed him. And liked it. Then, I killed again. And liked it even more. And so on. I was recruited by the Dark Brotherhood and have been here ever since. I met my husband Arnbjorn, rose to leadership. And now here we are. Be sure and introduce yourself to your new Family members. They're all very eager to meet you.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy!,CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. ""Ooh, you're such a pretty little girl. Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?"" Oh yes, please kind sir! My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley. ""Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth...your teeth! No! Aggghh!!""",CHARACTER,Babette,female
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Oh Babette, but you are so wicked.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Ah, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry...",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know. Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came ""this"" close to turning that priest inside-out. Damned messy.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"And what of your latest, Arnbjorn? Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!",CHARACTER,Babette,female
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Festus,male
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style. But now he's dead...and I have a new loincloth.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Festus,male
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,CHARACTER,Babette,female
"The player can do introductions with all the other members. This is optional, when they appear, give the same answer, excepting Nazir's.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well, well. It's raw meat. Oh, my beautiful wife has told me all about you. Let me guess -- Astrid failed to mention I'm her husband? She has a tendency to do that. Doesn't want the others thinking she plays favorites. (Remain silent) It's nice to meet you, Arnbjorn.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"You know nothing about me, or my abilities.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'll give you a week before you end up dead in a ditch.,CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look. If you're trying to get to know me -- don't. I don't like you, and I never will. It's nothing personal. But... My wife trusts you, and I trust her judgment. So you can't be all bad. Here's what you need to know: I'm a werewolf. I like killing things. I love Astrid. I hate annoying people. And the color blue gives me a headache.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"I might ask the same of you. For you are more than mortal. You are moon-born. You are wolf. So, you're a Companion, then? I can't imagine you got your gift anywhere else. I hope you have better luck with them than I did. Oh yes, I was once brother to the Companions. Let's just say they found my methods ""unsettling"". The Dark Brotherhood, obviously, feels differently.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"There you are! Astrid's told me all about you. Heard she pulled the ole ""Choose your victim"" gag with you. Ah, I love that one... Don't let my appearance throw you off. I'm older than you. A lot older. Getting bitten by a vampire when you're ten will do that to a girl. (Remain silent) It's nice to meet you, Babette.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
I will kill anyone who stands in my way. Anyone.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're going to love it here. We have a lot of fun, and we look out for each other. Just like any family.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm just a little girl! The Dark Brotherhood killed my mama and papa, and then they took me captive! Please, please help me! Rather convincing, don't you think? In truth, I'm no more a little girl than you are. I was once, of course. Three hundred years ago. Vampirism tends to keep one remarkably...fresh. Can't wait to hear all about the next person you murder.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Yes, yes, you're the new Family member. Let's make this easy -- consider me the cranky old uncle nobody talks to. You go your way, I'll go on mine. There's too much of an obsession these days with knives and arrows. You can kill someone just as easily with a well- -placed spell. (Remain silent) It's nice to meet you, Festus.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"Fine. I'm not here to make friends, old man.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hmph.,CHARACTER,Festus,male
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. I like to say I was born with a wand in my hand. Well, not literally -- you can see how painful that would have been for mother. But I was a prodigy! Casting simple spells by one, completing complex incantations by three. Resurrecting corpses by seven! Ha. When I was thirteen, I accidentally burned down the family home. A bit of lightning gone awry. Ah, but soon after I mastered my gifts. Completely. I went on to teach at the College -- left after two years. Too simple. Too safe. None of them truly understood the glory of the Destruction school... Remember, fireballs. You can never go wrong.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"New brother. May I offer my most sincere welcome to our Family. Does death not come to us all? Is it not a certainty? I am, therefore, honored to be doom's herald. To play some part in a being's inevitable end. (Remain silent) It's nice to meet you, Gabriella.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
I am an assassin without equal. I belong here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You certainly have a strange energy about you. I look forward to following your progress.,CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What a curious question. Well, I enjoy moonlit nights, taking long walks on the beach, knitting and unicorns. In fact, I once took a seaside stroll, on a moonlit night, and discovered a unicorn... which I proceeded to stab in the throat with a crochet needle. I'm a woman of refined, yet simple tastes. Until next time, brother.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"Welcome, my brother. Welcome to our Sanctuary. You have made the right choice joining us, I assure you. Me, I have been part of the Dark Brotherhood from the day I first hatched. I am Shadowscale, you see. Born under the sign of the Shadow. (Remain silent) It's nice to meet you, Veezara.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The Dark Brotherhood will return to greatness. With my help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You just trust in Astrid, follow her orders, and you'll do fine here.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Once, I was a Shadowscale. An assassin in service to the King of Black Marsh. Trained by the Dark Brotherhood since the day of my hatching. Ah, but that was a lifetime ago. Today, I am the last of my kind. My order is extinct. Now, I happily serve Astrid, and this Sanctuary. I am a trained killer, and once again have been given purpose. Life is good. Stay safe.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male

"So, you're the newest member of our dwindling, dysfunctional little Family. I've heard quite a bit about you.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
It's a pleasure to meet you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Save the niceties for now. I have no intention of getting invested in someone who may be dead tomorrow. If you're still breathing in a few weeks, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"You will hear more, I assure you.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ooh, cocky. I give you three days before you screw up and someone runs a knife across your throat. But who knows? I've been proven wrong beofre.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ahh, going for the mysterious and brooding thing, hmm? That may work for your targets, but you'll find I'm not so easily impressed.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Astrid said you'd have some work for me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Did she, now? Well, as it turns out, there are a few lingering we haven't had the chance to complete just yet. And more, dribbling in from time to time. I'll assign them to you as they become available. To be completed at your leisure.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Sounds simple enough.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It is. These aren't particularly glamorous assassinations, I'll be honest. Don't pay much, either. But they'll keep you busy. Just do them as you're able. There's no real time limit -- the targets aren't going anywhere. You can turn each one in as it's completed, or wait and turn in the whole group when all the targets have been eliminated. Whichever works for you.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, well, I'm a Redguard, as I'm sure you've noticed. Though not like most of my kind in Skyrim, that's for damned sure. I am a child of Hammerfell, born on the sands of the mighty Alik'r. In that great desert, blood is a shade of crimson I can scarce describe. My past is long and storied, and not altogether proud. The Dark Brotherhood saved me from myself. And I have never looked back.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
I'm ready for the first set of contracts.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well then, let's get started. I've got three available right now. Your targets are the beggar Narfi, an ex-miller named Ennodius Papius, and Beitild, a mine boss. When you've completed all those, we'll see if I might have some more.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Tell me about Narfi.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He's a hapless beggar living in some ruins just outside the village of Ivarstead. Easy even for you.,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Tell me about Ennodius.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He lives just outside Anga's Mill, in the woods. He was once the miller. Now Papius is just a paranoid recluse who thinks someone is out to get him. And he's right.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Tell me about Beitild.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
She separated from her husband several months ago. Now the two run competing mining operations. Beitild's angry and desperate. A fighter. Happy hunting.,CHARACTER,Nazir,male

Nazir will comment on each contract when it's completed.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Narfi is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Congratulations. You slaughtered an emaciated beggar in cold blood. You are truly an opponent to be feared. Here's your payment.,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Ennodius is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. And I hope you were careful in that lumber mill. Those splinters and rusty nails can be quite nasty. Your payment, for a job well done.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Beitild is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course she is. I hear the mining business is extremely cutthroat. And those hours...they're murder. I could do this all day. Here's your payment.,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"After at least one contract is done, returning to the Sanctuary reveals a new of some. The player stumbles upon them mid-argument.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely...punishment?,CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets ""punished"".",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Oh be quiet, you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil. Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper. Understood...husband?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Hmph.,CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
The crowd disperses.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, there you are. Good, I was done speaking to that muttering fool anyway. We've got some business to discuss.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Do you have a contract for me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I do indeed. You must go to the city of Markarth, and speak with the apothecary's assistant. You'll probably find her in the Hag's Cure, when the shop is open. The girl's been running her mouth, wants an ex-lover killed. She's apparently performed the Black Sacrament. Her name is Muiri. I need you to talk to her, set up the contract, and carry it out.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Anything else?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Just do whatever the contact wishes. Be professional, represent us well, and get the job done. Since it's your first contract, I'll let you keep whatever Muiri pays. She'll be generous, I'm sure. They always are.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"The other DB members can be asked to comment on the current contract and the insight into the mission, so I'll list it anyway.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Just be yourself. Eliminate the targets any way you see fit. Quiet, loud, quick, slow -- whatever you feel is best. Occasionally I'll give you a contract with certain parameters. Stay within them, and you'll earn yourself a bonus.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Very little. You have my word on that. The Night Mother represents a chapter in the Dark Brotherhood's history that has long since been closed. Today we live by our own rules. We're the last Sanctuary in all of Tamriel, and only by forgoing the old ways have we survived this long. My only worry is her ""Keeper."" I'm not sure what Cicero expects to gain by bringing the Night Mother here, but he'll soon learn this is my Sanctuary.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yeah. Follow my wife's orders, and don't do anything stupid.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
The witless fool and his pet corpse? Take a guess.,CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"You're headed to the Hag's Cure, right? It's a good shop. You should examine their wares. Never pass up the chance to buy a good potion... or poison. And one more thing. Have fun. You'll be committing a dark deed, but there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy yourself. You're only young once. Trust me, I know.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Two hundred years ago, I would have lain down my life for the Unholy Matron. But that age has long since passed. Astrid is my matron now.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Yes. Just because you're now a professional assasin, don't think you have to skulk around in the shadows like a skeever and stab people. Do what I do. Walk up to your target, introduce yourself, melt their skin off, and then run like the wind. Works every time.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"Their arrival is the best thing that's happened to this Sanctuary in years. Astrid is an effective leader, but we've been rudderless for too long. Scrounging for contracts, abandoning the Tenets. The Dark Brotherhood has been reduced to a group of common cutthroats. Frankly, it's embarrassing.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"You're being sent to meet with the contact directly, is that correct? What a most unusual occurrence. Astrid usually performs this duty herself. I can only assume she wants to test the full breadth of your abilities. So. Be polite, and professional, and represent us well.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"Without the Night Mother, there is no Dark Brotherhood. The Matron deserves our unwavering support and respect. Though I admit, I find her Keeper a bit too exuberant for my liking.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"You must speak to that Muiri woman, correct? I have heard rumors in Windhelm. She was recently implicated in a thievery, along with her lover. The lover will likely be your target. If memory serves me correctly, he leads a group of bandits. So this may be rather interesting for you.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Truthfully? I'm not entirely sure. It's not that I don't have the utmost respect for Sithis, and the Night Mother, and the ancient ways. I do. But I've never been much for religion. I kill because it's what I've been trained to do. It's all I know. So long as Astrid is happy, I'm happy.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"The contracts I dole out are fairly simple -- go to a location, and kill the target. But this is different. The jobs Astrid gives you will be more important, and usually more complex. Just keep your wits about you. And for Sithis' sake, don't get killed.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"I don't like mimes, minstrels, thespians, acrobats, jugglers, troubadours or tumblers. Flutists give me a headache. I particularly hate jesters. As a rule, I'm also not crazy about the corpses of old women. For the Night Mother, I'll make an exception. But Astrid is the only mistress I serve.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male

You're the man with the wagon! Transporting his mother...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am! I am! But not just my mother. Our mother, hmm? The Night Mother! Oh yes! • And you helped me! You helped poor Cicero! You talked to Loreius, got him to fix my wheel! Oh, you may have pleased me, but you have surely pleased the Night Mother. And our mother, she will never forget. • But you disappeared! You were there...then you weren't! Did you mean to help out poor Cicero or not? I'm left to wonder... Ah, it doesn't matter. What's done is done, right? Cicero is here! As is the Night Mother! Joy of joys!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male

"Another member of the Family! Hello, hello. So very good to meet you.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"It's good to meet you too, Cicero.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"Keep your distance, jester, and we'll get along just fine.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Do you mistrust poor Cicero? I am, as you say, just an innocent jester. A fool! Oh, but my work is not foolish, no. For I am our mother's Keeper.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oooh... So silent. So menacing. A true assassin of the old ways. Cicero likes you. Oh yes, Cicero likes you, indeed.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
Why did you come to the Sanctuary?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Night Mother's crypt in Bravil was...desecrated. The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present. So Cicero brought our Lady to her new home. Here! This is the only Sanctuary left in all of Skyrim, you see. Such was my...honor. As Keeper.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
Who is the Night Mother?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? Who is the Night Mother? Oh! Oh, you jest! You jest with gullible Cicero! You of course know that the Night Mother is our Unholy Matron. The undying spirit of a great woman who birthed the children of Sithis. And killed them. In his honor.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
Tell me about Sithis.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmmm... That's like telling you about the cold of space, or terror of midnight. Sithis is all those things. He is...the Void.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
What are the duties of a Keeper?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, Cicero takes care of our Lady's body. Oils it, preserves it, keeps it safe. Makes sure nobody disrespects our Matron's coffin.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
What can you tell me about yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Me? Oh, Cicero is just the Keeper! I...keep! I look after our matron, you see. The Night Mother. I keep her clean, and protected, and happy... But I am not the Listener. Oh no. There is no Listener. Not yet! But some day, some day, some day I pray that one will come to hear her say... The words.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
The Listener? What's a Listener?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, well, the Listener is the only person the Night Mother speaks to. It is the highest honor attainable by a member of the Dark Brotherhood. Of course our Lady is dead, so she doesn't talk with words, since her lips are...rotted. But inside the Listener's head. I hear it's...intimate. Ah, but there has not been a Listener in years and years. Our Lady has not chosen Cicero, and certainly not Astrid. Or...anyone. But some day... Farewell, farewell!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male

Why are you looking at me like that?,CHARACTER,Muiri,female

"The Dark Brotherh... Oh. Oh! I...my goodness, you're really here! The Black Sacrament. It actually worked?",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
Obviously. Now tell me what you need.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What I need? What I need is for Alain Dufont to die! I want him hunted down and murdered like the dog he is! (Remain silent) I'll need more to go on than that...,CHARACTER,Muiri,female
"By Sithis, I need details. Get to the point.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I didn't know when we were...with each other...but Alain is actually a leader of a band of cutthroat bandits. They're holed up in some old dwarven ruin -- Raldbthar. It's near Windhelm. They use it as their base. It's where they stage their raids. I want you to go to that ruin, find Alain Dufont, and kill him. I don't care about his friends. Do whatever you want with them. But Alain has to die!",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
"Actually, Alain Dufont is already dead. I killed him.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? Alain is...is dead? I...I'm grateful. It's just this...this isn't at all how I imagined things would play out. There was Alain, but I was considering more, and... Ah, well. Dead is dead. Right? My thanks to you, assassin. Here's the gold I was going to pay you for the job. You earned it, after all.",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
It will be done.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Excellent. Once Alain is dead, I'll pay you. In gold. I've saved up a bit. I hope that'll do. But, well... There is one more thing. If you're interested?",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
I'm listening.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you can...I want you to kill someone else, as well. You don't have to -- it's not part of our deal. But if you do...I'll pay you even more. It's Nilsine Shatter-Shield, in Windhelm. If Nilsine dies, too...I'll make it worth your while.",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
Tell me the full story. Why do you want Alain dead?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I went to Windhelm to see the Shatter-Shields. They were old and dear friends, and...in mourning. Friga was killed recently. Murdered... I met Alain at the tavern, while I was...drinking my sadness away. He was handsome, and charming. He said I was the ""beautiful lily"" of his dreams. Alain made all the pain just...go away. But it was all lies! Alain used me. He ruined my name, destroyed my friendship with the Shatter-Shields... Do you know why Alain was in Windhelm? He heard about Friga's murder. He wanted to befriend the family in their grief ...and rob them blind. Alain used me to get close to my friends. And now they all think I'm some kind of...monster. Alain Dufont took my life. And now I'm taking his.",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
And Nilsine Shatter-Shield? Why must she die?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't you see? I was like a daughter to Tova. A sister to Nilsine and Friga. But the family refuses to believe my innocence. No matter what I say. Couldn't they understand that I was used? That I was grieving for Friga, too? No...they treated me like garbage, threw me away. With Nilsine dead, maybe then Tova will realize what she's lost, hmm? Maybe then she'll see that I was just as much a daughter as the others. And if not, may she drown in her own tears.",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
Is there anything else?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I planned to kill Alain myself, you know. Nilsine, too. But lost my nerve. I even brewed a special poison, Lotus Extract. Maybe you could use it? Just coat your weapon with it. Then...you get the idea. Make them all pay for what they've done to me...",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
The player confronts Alain.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well. You must have all those annoying gods on your side to have made it this far, whoever you are. Even I have to admit, that's pretty impressive.",CHARACTER,Alain,male
If the player goes to Nilsine Shatter-Shield...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What? Did...you need something?,CHARACTER,Nilsine,female
Muiri sent me. She is quite unhappy...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Muiri? I can't believe my family trusted that backstabbling little strumpet. You tell her she's dead to us. You hear me? Dead!,CHARACTER,Nilsine,female
Do you hear that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's the sound of your sister, screaming in the Void...",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What kind of cruel, horrible person are you? My sister was murdered. Do you have any idea what that's like? What I'm going through?",CHARACTER,Nilsine,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You just going to stand there, gawking? Go away. You're starting to ...frighten me.",CHARACTER,Nilsine,female
The player returns to Muiri after slaying Alain.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well, what news? Is Alain...",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
Alain Dufont now lies dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That bastard got exactly what he deserved. • But last I heard, Nilsine is still alive. So I guess you decided not to kill her as well. I have to admit...I'm disappointed. Here's the payment for killing Alain. And nothing for letting Nilsine live. Just remember, that was your decision. • And...I heard about Nilsine. You have more than fulfilled your part of the bargain. Please, take this -- as payment, and a symbol of my affection. I'll never forget you.",CHARACTER,Muiri,female
"When the quest is over, it's back to the Sanctuary.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, you're back. So, how went our first real contract? A bit more exciting than what Nazir's been offering, I'd wager.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
I did what had to be done. Nothing more.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course, dear. Of course. And, from what my little ravens tell me, you handled yourself quite well.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
I live only to serve. Hail Sithis!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, very good. Very good indeed. You, my dear, are going to fit in here quite nicely...",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very well. I respect your discretion. Now, I need your assistance with a matter of a more...personal nature.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Is something wrong?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's Cicero. Ever since he arrived, his behavior's been... Well, erratic would be an understatement. I do believe he is truly mad. But it's worse than that. He's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones. Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Astrid, you're being a bit...paranoid.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maybe so, but healthy paranoia has saved this Sanctuary before, and my gut's telling me the demented little fool is up to something.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"By Sithis, we must stop them!",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So you understand my fear. If Cicero's planning something, and conspiring with one of our own, it would be disastrous.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You must understand. If Cicero is turning the others against me... against us... Our Family would not survive such division.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What do you want me to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Dear brother, I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting. It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look. Like inside the Night Mother's coffin.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
But that seems so...disrespectful.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Be that as it may, we have no other choice. You need to remain unseen! Now go, before they meet.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, the coffin. It's perfect.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They'll never think to check it. Who in their right mind would hide inside? Now go, before they meet.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No objections, then? Good. Go now. Before they meet. And report back to me with whatever you learn.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Any idea who would conspire with Cicero?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's the real question, isn't it? The jester enters, seals the door, and the conversation begins. So someone must be waiting for him inside. Any one of us could enter that chamber silently. Unnoticed. But who amongst us would dare conspire against the Sanctuary? The very thought breaks my heart.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What do you think Cicero is planning?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Isn't it obvious? As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to rule of this Sanctuary. Cicero will cite our independence as the need to rever to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even. Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Is there anything else I should know?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I don't believe so. But I'll be able to instruct you further after you've returned from the chamber. It depends on what you learn. And make haste! You must be in place before Cicero and his...ally arrive! They could be planning another meeting any time! Go. Quickly! Hide in the coffin before Cicero and the traitor meet.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
The player can talk to the other DB members about Astrid's conspiracy theory. Cicero doesn't appear for questioning this time.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"She said that? If I find anyone working against my wife, or this Sanctuary, I'll beat them to death with their own severed head. Of course, they'd probably already be dead... But you know what I meant!",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Oh! Well, I hope she doesn't suspect me. I mean, I've spoken with Cicero a bit, and he's quite charming. But I'd never go against Astrid. Never.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Ha! And would that surprise anyone? This Sanctuary's a mess. Wouldn't surprise me if somebody's talking to the fool on the sly. Making deals. And no, before you ask, it's not me. I know which side my bread is buttered on.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"To what end? Usurping Astrid's authority as leader of the Sanctuary? Hmmm... Yes, I can see her concern. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"You're joking. While I can understand if some Family members wish to honor the Old Ways once more, surely no one would oppose Astrid's rule.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Does she? Listen, brother... Astrid is my mistress, and I worship the ground she walks on. But this Cicero business has her a bit...paranoid.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"At Astrid's behest, the player hides in the coffin. As the door shuts, one the other door.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Are we alone? Yes...yes...alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan. The others...I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex...perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child... What about you? Have you...have you spoken to anyone? No... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and the saying! And what do you do? Nothing! Not...not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys! You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you... ...sweet Night Mother.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"At that moment, the corpse the player's facing glows slightly, and one hears the Night Mother's voice speaking directly into the mind.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Poor Cicero. Dear Cicero. Such a humble servant. But he will never hear my voice. For he is not the Listener.,CHARACTER,Night Mother,female

"Oh, but I will speak. I will speak to you. For you are the one. Yes, you. You who shares my iron tomb, who warms my ancient bones. I give you this task -- journey to Volunruud. Speak with Amaund Motierre.",CHARACTER,Night Mother,female
"Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Tell Cicero the time has come. Tell him the words he has been waiting for, all these years: ""Darkness rises when silence dies.""",CHARACTER,Night Mother,female

"The Night Mother spoke to me! She said ""I am the one.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
She...spoke to you? More treachery! More trickery and deceit! You lie! The Night Mother speaks only to the Listener! And there is...no... Listener!,CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Wait! She said to tell you, ""Darkness rises when silence dies.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She...she said that? She said those words...to you? ""Darkness rises when silence dies""? But those are the words. The Binding Words. Written in the Keeping Tomes. The signal so I would know. Mother's only way of talking to sweet Cicero... Then...it is true! She is back! Our Lady is back! She has chosen a Listener! She has chosen you! Ha ha ha! All hail the Listener!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Astrid enters the hall, having heard the jester's happy shrieks.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over! Are you alright? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me! Oh, no. She spoke only to him! To the Listener!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"When I heard Cicero screaming, I knew you'd been discovered. I feared the worst. Are you all right?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, I'm fine.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then what in Sithis' name is going on? Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Is this just more of the fool's rambling?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
I...I don't know. It happened so fast.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay, let's all take a deep breath. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother, but she spoke to you? Please tell me this is some kind of sick joke.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You look like you've just seen a ghost. Please tell me you haven't. Cicero said he spoke to the Night Mother...but she spoke to you?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"It's true. The Night Mother spoke to me. She said I was ""the one"".",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? So Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else. Just...the Night Mother's body? And the Night Mother, who, according to everything we know, will only speak to the person chosen as Listener...just spoke. Right now... ...to you?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Yes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
By Sithis. And...what did she say?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"I must speak to someone named Amaund Motierre, in Volunruud.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Amaund Motierre? I have no idea who that is. But Volunruud...that I have heard of. And I know where it is.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So I should go to Volunruud? I should talk to this man?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmm? No. No! Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but you take your orders from me. Are we clear on that? The Night Mother may have spoken to you, but I am still the leader of this Family. I will not have my authority so easily dismissed. I...I need time to think about all this. Go see Nazir -- do some work for him. I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter further.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
One can pick Cicero's brain about Listener duties...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served mother well, I have!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
What exactly does a Listener do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, the Listener, well...listens. The Night Mother speaks to you. Guides you on your path. But when the Night Mother speaks, the Listener must obey. You must! For her word is the will of Sithis. And Sithis is the Dark Brotherhood incarnate.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
Will the Night Mother speak to me again?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha! Surely you're pulling Cicero's leg! Wait...the Listener is serious? Oh. Well of course the Night Mother will speak to you again! She might speak now, or later, or...I don't know! But speak she will! The Night Mother is part of you now! You get to hear voices inside your head! The rest of us should be so lucky.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Cicero, did you want to be the Listener?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh... Well...yes. I did. I did indeed. I tried to listen. Tried so hard. But the Night Mother never spoke to poor Cicero. The silence became almost...maddening. Oh, but that was then! This is now! You're the Listener, and the Night Mother chose you for a reason, I'm sure! Cicero will remain the happy Keeper. Are you excited? Oh, you should be. Things are finally looking up!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
One goes to Nazir.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Astrid wanted me to see you about some more work.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well then, your timing couldn't be better. As it turns out, I've got two new contracts. One rather easy assignment, and another that should prove quite a challenge. Your first target is an orc bard named Lurbuk. The other is a vampire by the name of Hern. Happy hunting.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Tell me about Hern.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He's a vampire, and has blended into human society for years. He's never far from his female companion, Hert. Also a vampire. The contract is for the male, Hern. But you'll probably have to contend with the female, too. So for Sithis' sake, watch yourself.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Tell me about Lurbuk.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He is, by all accounts, the worst bard in Skyrim. Apparently, so many people sought his death, Astrid had to hold a lottery to determine the client. You've got people to kill, my friend. Best get to it.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male

"Sing me a song, bard. A song of fear, and death!",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmmm... All right... How about this? ""Shadow creep and, and...phantoms leap! A man got...he got scared. And the demons dared! To um...visit upon him all which they feared!"" Brilliant, I know. It's a gift.",CHARACTER,Lurbuk,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What's the matter, friend? Khajiit got your tongue? Maybe you need a little ditty to loosen your gob, hmm? ""There once was a stranger, with eyes full of danger, he spoke not a word, but his meaning was heard... Sing on, sweet Lurbuk, sing on!""",CHARACTER,Lurbuk,male
They find Hern at Anga's Mill in Falkreath.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well now. What have we here? A lost little lamb?,CHARACTER,Hern,male
"I know what you are, nightspawn.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well then, you won't be leaving here alive!",CHARACTER,Hern,male
Assassin versus vampire. A fight for the ages.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, so the Brotherhood has come for old Hern, has it? Well then, let us meet as equals.",CHARACTER,Hern,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. Don't say much, but there's a strange aura about you. You walk in the shadow of death... Leave here. Leave here and never return.",CHARACTER,Hern,male
"After the kills, one returns to the Sanctuary.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We need to talk. (Remain silent) Of course, Astrid. What is it?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Has the time come? Will I now serve the Night Mother?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look. Something is happening here. I'm not entirely sure what that something is, but... Well, we need to find out. If the Night Mother really did give you an order to talk to a contact, we'd be mad to ignore it. And I think we both agree, Cicero's brought quite enough madness to this Sanctuary. So go. Go to Volunruud. It's a crypt, pretty far to the northeast. Talk to this Amaund Motierre. And let's see where all this leads, hmm?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Nazir will comment on completed contracts at this point.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Hern is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No sarcasm this time. You faced a vampire, and lived to tell the tale. Well done. And if you contracted Sanguinare Vampiris, be sure to get that taken care of. Else you'll end up like our own Babette. Unless, of course, that was your goal all along. Here's your payment.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
Lurbuk is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Wonderful. The only good bard is a dead one, as far as I'm concerned. All that singing and...mirth. Your payment, as per the usual.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"The player can also ask Family members about the current Volunruud contract. Cicero has no lines in this regard, though.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Oho! The Listener wants my counsel! I thought you were above the opinions of mere mortals, now that you commune with dead old women.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"The man you need to speak with, his name is Motierre? That's a very old and powerful Breton family, firmly established in Cyrodiil. Most curious...",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"So you're the Listener, hmm? Well that hardly seems fair. You just got here. The Night Mother should have spoken to me. Any idiot could see that. But, I will serve gladly, as that is my lot in life. Now let's see. Ah yes, Volunruud. It's an old crypt, infested with Draugr. So plan accordingly.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"If the Night Mother truly spoke to you, if you really are the Listener...your destiny was written in the Void. Astrid is right to fear your power.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"You may be the Listener, or you may just be a lunatic who's started hearing voices. Either way, Astrid is still your mistress. Not the Night Mother.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Just remember Astrid's commitment to her Sanctuary, to her Family. A Family that now counts you as one of its own. Honor Astrid above all others.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"The player goes to Volunruud, finding the client a short ways inside.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
By the Almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing...it worked.,CHARACTER,Amaund,male
"The Night Mother heard your pleas, Motierre.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, um... So it would seem. Well, I won't waste your time.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
"You have opened the door to darkness, little man.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, I know. I know. But I'm so glad you're here. Please, allow me to state my business. Surely your time is as valuable as my own.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Right, then. You prefer to listen, is that it? Well, you must represent the Dark Brotherhood. I certainly wasn't expecting anyone else. So, I'll cut right to the chase. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experience in, well, centuries.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
Go on.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied. I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably find it enjoyable. But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target. The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of... ...the Emperor.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
Leaders rise and fall. Business is business.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, wonderful. You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
You want us to kill...the Emperor. Of Tamriel?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That is correct. What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is...what you do? No? You must understand.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's a shocking request, I know. But it is within the purview of what you Dark Brotherhood types do. Isn't it? If history is to be believed? You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. It's as if the very stars have finally aligned. But I digress... Here, they need to be delivered to your, um...superior. Rexus. The items.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
"Rexus, the bodyguard, hands over the notes.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here. Here.,CHARACTER,Rexus,male
Rexus will now give you two items which must be passed along to your superior. The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable -- you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.,CHARACTER,Amaund,male
The player can question Amaund further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Was there...something else you need?,CHARACTER,Amaund,male
"Who are you, Motierre? Who are you, really?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I performed the Black Sacrament, contacted you people, because I thought you guaranteed discretion. Is this no longer so?",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
Why do this? Why have the Emperor assassinated?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In the year 3E 41, Emperor Pelagius Septim was murdered in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City. Cut down by a Dark Brotherhood assassin. His killing ushered in, shall we say, a necessary change in Imperial policy. There are those now who wish for a similar change. I am sorry, but that's all I'm at liberty to say.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
We'll require...significant compensation. Can you pay the price?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, my furtive friend. When Emperor Titus Mede II lies dead, there will be gold...a fortune in gold. But so much more! It is said that the Dark Brotherhood, in recent times, has been in decline. That you lack the power, wealth, and respect of days past. Is it not so? If you do this, if you kill the Emperor... Oh, how the masses will fear and respect you.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
You can trust your servant to keep this secret?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, Rexus is no mere servant. He has been with the Motierre family since I was a child. I trust the man with my life. You must deliver those items to your superior. And I...I must get out of this foul place.",CHARACTER,Amaund,male
The player returns to the Sanctuary.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You're back. Good. All right, so? Did you meet this Motierre? What did he want?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Motierre wants us...to kill the Emperor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You're joking.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Show Astrid the amulet and sealed letter),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What's this?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
The letter explains it all. The amulet is for expenses.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By Sithis, you're not joking. To kill the Emperor of Tamriel...the Dark Brotherhood hasn't done such a thing since the assassination of Pelagius. As a matter of fact, no one has dared assassinate an Emperor of Tamriel since the murder of Uriel Septim, and that was two hundred years ago...",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Surely the Night Mother wouldn't misdirect us...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, she certainly wouldn't. And...for whatever reason, she chose to relay Motierre's information to you. I don't know exactly what's going on here, if you're the Listener, or this is some kind of fluke, or what. But what we now have before us...",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So we'll accept the contract?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're damn right we'll accept it. If we pull this off, the Dark Brotherhood will know fear and respect we haven't seen in centuries. You think I'd abandon an opportunity to lead my Family to glory? But this is all so much to take in. I need time to read the letter, and figure out where we go from here. And this amulet. Hmmm...",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What are you thinking?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm thinking we need that amulet appraised. I want to know where it came from, how much it's worth, and if we can actually get away with selling it. And, there's only one man who can give us what we need -- Delvin Mallory. He's a fence, a private operator. Works out of the Ratway, in Riften. Give me the letter. Bring Mallory the amulet. Find out everything you can, and sell it if he's willing. He'll offer a letter of credit -- that's fine. Delvin Mallory and the Dark Brotherhood have...history. He can be trusted.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"The player finds Delvin in Riften's subterranean bar, the Ragged Flagon. He responds differently if the player's unaffiliated with the Guild.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Somethin' you need? Anything for the Guild.,CHARACTER,Delvin,male
"Ah, now you must be lost. Best ya scurry off while you're able. The Ratway, well, it has a habit of swallowin' up the uninvited.",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
"Actually, I'm here on Dark Brotherhood business.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Dark Brotherhood requires your services.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh. Oh I see. • Well now, how is Astrid doin' these days, uh? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up. Ah, but we can discuss that later, yeah? What does the Brotherhood need? • Well, you're makin' friends, ain't ya? So, uh...how is Astrid doin' these days? Tell her to stop by some time. We can have a drink. Catch up. Ah, but business! Of course. What kind of business?",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
What can you tell me about this? (Give Delvin the amulet),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let's see... Where oh where did you get this? Don't answer -- I don't want to know. This is an amulet of the Emperor's Elder Council. Specially crafted for each member. Worth a small fortune. Ain't somethin' you'd give up lightly. Look, it ain't my business ta tell the Dark Brotherhood its business, but if you killed a member of the Elder Council, you'd better belie--",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
Will you buy it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Buy it? This? An Elder Council amulet? Oh yes. Oh yes, indeed. Wait just a moment... Here. It's a letter of credit. Usable, by Astrid only, for any service or item I can provide. As per our standard arrangement. You bring that back to your lovely mistress. With my regards.",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
The player returns to the Sanctuary.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Good, you're back. Well, what did Mallory have to say? Is the amulet authentic?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, and specially made for members of the Elder Council.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Elder Council... Oh, now that explains quite a bit. Motierre, you naughty, naughty boy. Hiring the Dark Brotherhood to help you rise beyond your station. Delicious. Was Mallory willing to buy the amulet?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
He was. Here's a letter of credit.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Splendid. Then we're ready to begin. Or, specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the Night Mother spoke to. Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
A wedding?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake...stab the bride. Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding. And they say romance is dead.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Who's the target?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Her name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude. The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want. Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus. Now go. And give my best to the bride.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Enough talk. Just tell me who to kill.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very well. The target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude. The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Remember, we want people to notice. Kill Vici while she's addressing her guests, as is the custom, and I can promise a bonus. Now go. And give the bride a special kiss, from me.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your target's name is Vittoria Vici. She oversees the East Empire Company's business holdings in Solitude. The wedding is being held in that city, at the Temple of the Divines. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want. Vici is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus. Now go. And give the city of Solitude a celebration they're not likely to forget.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Can you provide any more details on the contract?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is a public kill. How you do it is entirely up to you. Arrow to the throat? Knife in the belly? Your choice, so long as it's loud and messy. Because of the current political climate, people are going to assume the murder is related to the bad blood between the Legion and Stormcloaks. In any event, when Vici dies, it's going to be complete pandemonium. Best have your escape route planned out in advance.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What's Vici's connection to the Emperor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"An excellent question. Vittoria Vici is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, Titus Mede II. Vici has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the Stormcloaks. Their union is a step toward reconciliation. So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process -- it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire. The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to Skyrim to deal with the aftermath...and he'll find the Dark Brotherhood waiting.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Why isn't the Emperor attending the wedding?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. He had a trip to Skyrim planned for months, and canceled at the last minute. Much to his cousin's dismay. Seems the Emperor realized his presence would necessitate a more direct role in the ongoing hostilities. A role he was, obviously, unwilling to take. All that will change with his cousin's murder. Everyone will think it was motivated by the conflict between the Imperial Legion and Stormcloaks. And the Emperor will be forced to come clean up the mess. Off to Solitude with you. Time to give the Emperor some real motivation to visit Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"As usual, the other Family members can comment on the current contract.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You got to kill a soft little woman on her wedding day? What's next? Murdering a crippled orphan in his sleep?,CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"It's no fair. I love weddings. Astrid should have given this contract to me. Instead, she's got me visiting cities, assessing security. How boring. But listen, I think I can help you. The wedding reception is outside the Temple of the Divines, right? In Solitude? If so, the bride will probably address the crowd from the balcony. It overlooks the courtyard. Well, there's an old statue there. I've seen it. Hanging right over where she'll be standing. Old means weak. Weak means it could fall. Hmmm?",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Ah, killing her will be easy. She'll be so happy, she'll never see it coming. I should know, I killed a bride once. It was our honeymoon. Tepid, I said! The bathwater should be tepid! Lukewarm is not tepid! Close, maybe, but there is a difference! Stupid cow.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of surveying the site of the reception. There's a small parapet, just opposite the balcony, that would prove an excellent spot for a long-range kill. I left something there for you. If you're inclined to take that approach.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
Slaughtering the Emperor's cousin? At her wedding? Those guards will be out for blood. Wouldn't surprise me if the crowd jumped in too.,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Your contract sound simple, which means it certainly will not be. Getting into that reception will be easy, but have you thought about getting out?",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The player goes to the wedding. If Vici is approached formally...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What an amazing day this has been. I hope you've been enjoying the festivities. I'm...I'm just so overwhelmed. Such kindness...for me.,CHARACTER,Vittoria,female
The Stormcloaks say hello!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh! Well, you tell your Stormcloak friends ""hello"" right back at them! This is a day of healing! Legion, Stormcloaks -- all are welcome here!",CHARACTER,Vittoria,female
Hail the Imperial Legion!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha ha ha ha! Yes, yes indeed! Hail the Imperial Legion! Hail the Stormcloaks! Hail Solitude and the Eight Divines! On this glorious day, we honor everyone! Ha ha ha ha!",CHARACTER,Vittoria,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, no need to be shy! My day is your day! Please -- eat, drink, make merry! We're all friends here!",CHARACTER,Vittoria,female
Vittoria will also make a speech from the balcony. For posterity:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Good people of Solitude. I just wanted to thank you all for being here. To thank you for sharing this wonderfully happy day with myself, and my new husband. Today, the problems of Skyrim are not my problems. Nor are they yours. Today we are joined in peace and happiness. So please, enjoy yourselves. I thank you all again for making this the best wedding a woman could ask for.",CHARACTER,Vittoria,female
"After the kill goes down, panic erupts.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What in the...? Vittoria! No!,CHARACTER,Asgeir Snow-Shod,male
Aiiiieeeeeeee!,CHARACTER,Nura Snow-Shod,female
No! Noooooo!,CHARACTER,Alexia,female
The bride has been murdered! Somebody help!,CHARACTER,Pantea,female
"If the player is detected, Veezara may appear.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Astrid ordered me to keep an eye on you. Figured you could use a hand when the chaos erupted. I'll try to hold them off as best I can. You get back to the Sanctuary.,CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Either way, the player returns to Sanctuary.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ha ha! The news is everywhere! Vittoria Vici, the Emperor's cousin, butchered at her own wedding! Well done! Let's see his eminence try to ignore this. (Remain silent) She bled like a stuck pig.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, the blushing bride now serves Sithis in the Void.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"With Vici's murder, you've started us down a path the Dark Brotherhood hasn't traveled in centuries. The assassination of an Emperor. And now, your reward. A unique spell to summon a legend of the Dark Brotherhood. His soul serves us now in death, as his body once did in life.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Ah, and of course, the bonus, for killing Vici while she addressed her guests, as instructed. Gold...simple and pure. Spend it as you will.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Unfortunately, in your zeal, you failed to eliminate Vici while she addressed her guests, as directed. I'm sorry, but your bonus is forfeit.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Now then, time to proceed to the next stage of the plan. Go and speak with Gabriella. She's been helping me arrange your next contract.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"If Veezara appeared in Solitude, he'll comment on it back at the Sanctuary.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, you're back. It was good to fight alongside you. I'm sure people won't be forgetting that wedding anytime soon, hmm?",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The player locates Gabriella.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Dear brother. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
She did. What are the details?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"With the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection. You are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on him, implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
I understand. Gaius Maro will die.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Gaius Maro will die! Hail Sithis!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim. Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest. Oh, and one final thing...",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
Yes?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"To earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun. Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
What will killing Gaius Maro accomplish?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Killing Commander Maro would do no good. Someone would merely replace him. No, we need him to remain in charge. But...distracted. Weakened. Implicate and kill his son Gaius, and the commander will be grief-stricken and humiliated, his family name ruined. The security plan will then fail. Best yet, the Emperor will be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking an assassination plot had already been discovered and foiled.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
Tell me about Dragon Bridge.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's a small town, with one rather unique feature -- it houses Skyrim's only Penitus Oculatus outpost. It was established by Commander Maro when he first arrived in Skyrim, several months ago. When he began preparing for the Emperor's initial visit.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
Do you know Gaius Maro's schedule?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, so your best plan is to follow him after he leaves Dragon Bridge. However, there is one other option... We know there's an actual written travel schedule, somewhere in the Penitus Oculatus outpost. Securing that would, obviously, be most beneficial... Walk in Gaius Maro's shadow, and deliver to him the judgment of Sithis.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"All uninvolved Family members can give their two cents, except Cicero.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I've taken the liberty of visiting the cities, and spreading some nasty rumors about Gaius Maro. To make his treachery that much more believable.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"What's the matter, Listener? The Night Mother not feeling very chatty these days? You need help from your flesh and blood lessers? You've got to track a man, kill him, and then frame him for a crime. This contract's perfect...for me. Clearly, my lovely wife made a mistake.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Normally I talk to a victim before I end his life, but I wouldn't recommend it this time. Maro will be alert to danger. Talking may spook him.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Remember, your target is Gaius Maro, the son. Not Commander Maro, the father! We need him alive. But the son... Ha! Scorch his face off!",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"Killing Gaius Maro in a city will be challenging because of all the guards, but fights, even murder, are fairly common. Killing him secretly will certainly make things easier on you, but if there are witnesses, so be it.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Astrid had me investigate the Penitus Oculatus. Their members are highly trained, effective warriors. Be on your guard, brother.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The player goes to Dragon Bridge. Gaius is talking with his pops.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Father, you worry too much. I'll be fine.",CHARACTER,Gaius,male
"I know you will. But all the same, remember everything I said. Stay alert, and when you get to the cities, make your observations and move on.",CHARACTER,Commander Maro,male
"I understand. But you're being paranoid. I'm inspecting security, not charging off into battle. There's not a lot that can go wrong.",CHARACTER,Gaius,male
"Son, when the Emperor's safety is concerned, anything could go wrong. Off with you, now. And good travels.",CHARACTER,Commander Maro,male
"Farewell, father. I'll return as soon as I'm able.",CHARACTER,Gaius,male
"Well, this is it, then. Look after yourself, Gaius. You're doing your duty, and I'm proud of you. But you'd better come back to me. You hear?",CHARACTER,Faida,female
"Oh, Faida. I may travel alone, but you know I carry you always in my heart. I'll see you soon.",CHARACTER,Gaius,male
If Gaius is ever approached for conversation...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Keep back, citizen. I have important business I must attend to.",CHARACTER,Gaius,male
"After I kill you, I'm going to kill the Emperor.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What? Filthy assassin! We'll see who lies dead!,CHARACTER,Gaius,male
Traveling alone can be so dangerous...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"After the kill, one returns to Gabriella.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, at last. I've been anxiously awaiting your return.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
Gaius Maro is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I know. As does Astrid. • You have done well, and have earned both your reward, and a bonus, as I may have mentioned. • And you've earned your payment, though the bonus is forfeit, as I'm sure you're aware. But you should know that we have a more pressing matter to deal with. It's...Cicero. There's been an incident. You should proceed into the Sanctuary. I'll let Astrid explain.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
The player enters the main hall to find Babette tending to a wounded Veezara.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Just try to relax, Veezara. Let the elixir do its work. You'll feel better, shortly.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Achh... Thank you, dear. You are most kind. The jester's cut feels as bad as it looks, I'm afraid.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Damn it, this never should have happened! We knew better. We knew better, and still we let our guards down. Agh!",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"I'll admit, even I'm having a hard time disagreeing with you...",CHARACTER,Festus,male
The player walks over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Maro is dead, I know. But we've got bigger problems right now!",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Gabriella mentioned something about Cicero...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The fool went absolutely berserk! He wounded Veezara, he tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"It's true, I'm afraid. Cicero was a little whirlwind, slashing this way and that. It would have been funny, if he weren't trying to murder us all.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"Don't forget the ranting and raving. About the Night Mother, how she was the true leader of the Dark Brotherhood and Astrid was just a ""pretender.""",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Look, we've got to deal with this situation. You've got to deal with this situation.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What do you want me to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life! But first...find my husband. Make sure he's all right. After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left...Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild. Search Cicero's room. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone. Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Bested by a fool. Who's the fool now, hmm?",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Hush, Veezara. You were very brave. Astrid may well be dead if not for you.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"She's right. I'll be forever in your debt, dearest brother. Now be quiet. Just...just rest.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Everyone present can comment on Cicero's latest annoyance, both when starting dialogue and when asked directly. Astrid has additional replies.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
That twisted jester will pay for what he's done...,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Isn't there any way to work this out?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look, the Dark Brotherhood is a family. This Sanctuary is a family. And, we've always welcome those...shunned by society. Werewolves, wizards, eternal ten-year-old vampires...what does it matter? In truth, I've rarely met a lunatic I haven't liked. Cicero's problem isn't his madness. It's an adherence to an ancient, outmoded way of life. The Night Mother's ways...simply are not our ways. He just couldn't accept that. And now he'll have to pay the price.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Did something set Cicero off?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, nothing. At least nothing I'm aware of. Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation. Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense. Cicero may have heard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother. It's possible I was...not entirely respectful. But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of the Sanctuary. Cicero must pay with his life. There is no other option. Damnable jester...",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
I believed in Cicero. But he's betrayed us all.,CHARACTER,Babette,female
Cicero destroyed any sympathy I may have had for him when he wounded Veezara. Kill the fool and be done with it. Go. Do what has to be done.,CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Boy, did you miss all the excitement.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"All right, so maybe I was wrong. Maybe Cicero coming here wasn't the best thing that could have happened. But even I didn't anticipate this. Well, you know the old saying. When life gives you lemons... ...go murder a clown. Burn that little jester alive.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"It was a truly terrifying scene. Beautiful, in some respects.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"I feel only pity for Cicero. He must die, of course, but can any of us truly blame him for his actions? We mocked him, disrespected the Old Ways. Our actions were shameful. Surely the Night Mother weeps this day.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
Should have figured the little lunatic would completely snap.,CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Going after Cicero now would be a fool's errand. That little jester is currently being digested in Arnbjorn's stomach, mark my words.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
It only hurts when I laugh. He he he. Oww...,CHARACTER,Veezara,male
"Yes, do not underestimate Cicero. A man like that, small and foolish, is easy to mock. To underestimate. Don't make the same mistake I did.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The player finds writings in Cicero's quarters. Astrid is notified.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Have you found something?,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, Cicero's journal.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good, good. Does it say where he may be headed?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, an abandoned Sanctuary in Dawnstar. I have the passphrase.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Dawnstar Sanctuary? Whatever for? Never mind, it doesn't matter. You need to leave. Now. Every moment counts, so I want you to take my horse. His name is Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool. Let's just say he's...one of us. Find Arnbjorn. Make sure my husband's all right. And then send that jester's twisted little soul to the Void, in as many pieces as possible.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What do we know of the Dawnstar Sanctuary?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, it's ancient. Apparently one of the first Sanctuaries in Skyrim. It hasn't been used by the Brotherhood in close to a hundred years. If you say Cicero has gone there, then it stands to reason that he's familiar with the place. That means you'll be fighting him on his own ground. Tread carefully.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
The player finds the target Sanctuary carved into a hill near Dawnstar. A wounded Arnbjorn sits outside in a pool of his own blood.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Should have figured Astrid would send you.,CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
You're hurt.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What gave it away? Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, got to admit that little jester's good with that butter knife. But don't worry, I gave as good as I got.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
Where's Cicero now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In there! Through the door. Some old Sanctuary, by the looks of it. I would have followed him, but I don't know the phrase.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
I know the phrase. I'll get Cicero -- you go home.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right, you convinced me. Doubt I'll be much good to you, anyway. The little fop cut me pretty deep. But I slashed him good. Pretty sure I severed an artery. Don't know what you're going to find in there...but you can probably just follow the blood. Do me a favor and kill that little jester twice. Just to make sure.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"The player gains entry with the ""Innocence, dear Brother"" passphrase. The glacial lair.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Listener! Is that you? Oh, I knew you'd come. Send the best to defeat the best. Astrid knew her stupid wolf couldn't slay sly Cicero.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Oh, but this isn't at all what mother would want. You kill the Keeper or I kill the Listener? Now that's madness.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Ouch! Pointy pointy! My home is well defended. I always have been a stickler for details. Get it? ""Stick-ler."" Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I slay me!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"You're...still alive. Cicero respects the listener's abilities, of course, but could you at least slow down a bit? I'm not what I used to be. Heh.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Brrr! Chilly! You'll enjoy this. Not an original part of the Sanctuary, per se. Let's call it a ""forced addition."" Forced by what? Oh, come and see!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"All right, so Cicero attacked that harlot, Astrid! But what's a fool to do, when his mother is slandered and mocked? Surely the Listener understands!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Cicero admits, he thought the Listener would be dead by now. Heh. Maybe we can just forget all this? Hmm? Let bygones be bygones? What do you say?",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"If it's any comfort, I do feel slightly bad about Veezara. Stupid lizard got in my way! But please tell me that hulking sheepdog has bled to death.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
And now we come to the end of our play. The grand finale.,CHARACTER,Cicero,male
The player finally confronts Cicero as he's bleeding out by a fireplace.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You caught me! I surrender! Ha ha ha ha.,CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"There is only one cure for your madness, Cicero. Me.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, I like that! Very good, very good! Creative! But killing me would be a mistake! Oh yes. You would displease our mother, hmm? For she's your mother too, isn't she...Listener? Walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell the pretender Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! One little itty bitty lie!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
"Time to die, traitor!",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Traitor? Me? Silly assassin. So confused, so confused...and they say I'm mad! If I'm a traitor, so are you! Have you not heard the maiden's voice? Are you not the Listener? So walk away! Let poor Cicero live! Tell Astrid you did the job! Stabbed, strangled, drowned poor Cicero! A tiny white lie for a dark assassin!",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, you prefer to listen, eh? Of course, of course! The Listener listens! A joke! A funny joke! I get it. Then listen to this -- don't kill me. Let poor Cicero live! I attacked the strumpet Astrid, I did! And I'd do it again! Anything for our mother! Return to the pretender, tell her I'm dead! Tell her you strangled me with my own intestines! Ha ha! But lie! Yes, lie! Lie, and let me live! Do what you will. Cicero has no fight left. In the end, Sithis will judge us both.",CHARACTER,Cicero,male
If one kills him:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Coming...Mother...,CHARACTER,Cicero,male
One returns to Astrid afterward.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Arnbjorn is safe, and for that you have my thanks. But what of the fool? Is Cicero dead?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"Yes, Cicero is dead. / Yes, Cicero is dead. (Lie)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Excellent. Once again, you've proven yourself a born assassin. Tell you what. Why don't you hold onto Shadowmere a while longer? He's a fine steed, and hasn't been ridden as nearly as much as he should lately. And now that this Cicero mess has been mopped up, we can get back to the matter at hand, hmm?",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Right. So what's my next task?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There's just one more target before we strike out at the Emperor. Have you by chance heard of the ""Gourmet""? Read his cookbook? It's become quite a phenomenon. The Gourmet is scheduled to cook for the Emperor at a special dinner. You'll kill him, steal his Writ of Passage, and assume the roll of master chef. Festus has been spearheading this part of the assassination plan. He's close to discovering the identity of the Gourmet. You should report to him.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Arnbjorn has additional dialogue at this time.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There you are. Look, I...I just wanted to say thanks for coming to find me. Back in Dawnstar. Crazy jester finally met his match, am I right?",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
One visits Festus for more info.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There you are. Took your sweet time dealing with Cicero, hmph? Now let's get down to business. Astrid told you about the Gourmet, I hope?",CHARACTER,Festus,male
That I need to kill him and take on his identity?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Quite so. But first you'll need to learn who he is. Assuming, of course, that the Gourmet actually is a ""he."" Could be a woman for all we know.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
So you don't even know who the Gourmet is? Wonderful.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't be so petulant!,CHARACTER,Festus,male
Do you have any idea how I might find out?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, indeed I do! Indeed I do!",CHARACTER,Festus,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You know, maybe I was wrong about you after all. Anyone who's smart enough to shut up and listen can't be all bad. In my, um, investigations, I came upon this. It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see! Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
And this Anton Virane knows the Gourmet's true identity?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I believe so. Therefore, you need to obtain that information from Virane -- who the Gourmet is, and where he can be found. Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him. Loose ends and all that. Next, you'll have to... Are you still paying attention? (Remain silent) Of course, Festus. Please continue.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"Oh, I'm waiting with bated breath...",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place. Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better. Now off with you!",CHARACTER,Festus,male
What else can you tell me about the Gourmet?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Nobody knows his true identity. Well, nobody except Gaius Maro, and you've already taken care of him. I do know the Gourmet was classically trained in traditional Breton cuisine in High Rock. So that's where he must have met Anton Virane. In any event, our anonymous chef shares a passion for food with all of Tamriel. And that anonymity will prove the Emperor's undoing.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
Tell me about this cookbook.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"""Uncommon Taste."" It was published a few years ago, and became a sensation throughout the Empire almost overnight. The recipes were hailed as both practical and decadent. I've made a few of the Gourmet's dishes myself, actually. His roast mutton with Redguard berry sauce is to die for. But his chocolate pate gives me the runs.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
So the Gourmet is in Skyrim?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Gaius Maro, on orders from his father, arranged for the Gourmet to come to Skyrim months ago. To serve as the Emperor's personal chef. But the Emperor cancelled his journey at the last minute. Maro was smart, kept the Gourmet around, in case things changed. And so, the Gourmet has remained in seclusion, somewhere in Skyrim...on indefinite hold. Probably feels like a prisoner. But you'll fix that. Remember, the Markarth Keep. That's where you'll find Anton Virane. Probably cooking up all of the Gourmet's recipes, passing them off as his own.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
Those unrelated will chime in if asked about the job.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Believe it or not, Festus likes you. He senses your power, your potential. Follow his instructions to the letter, and you may even earn his respect.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"The last thing you need is my help. Listener or not, you have proven yourself time and again. To Astrid, to the Family...and to me.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
"Yes -- don't kill the Gourmet! Oh, I know you have to, but it makes me sad all the same. I love the Gourmet's recipes. The world will soon be a blander, last flavorful place.",CHARACTER,Babette,female
"You've been directed to dispose of the Gourmet's body, is that correct? I often find water to be a suitable hiding place. A lake, a pool...the sea.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"Hmph. I wouldn't worry too much about this Virane giving you the information you need. Give him a good scare, and he'll squawk like a Hagraven. That said... If your attack on Virane is witnessed, those Markarth guards are going to be none too happy...",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Hmmm... Well, assuming this Gourmet is just a cook, it will probably be an easy kill. Just be discreet -- alerting others will be the real threat.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The player visits the cook in Markarth's Understone Keep.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Yes, yes, for the hundredth time, I am a Breton. I was born in High Rock. And then I came here. I am not a Reachman! (Remain silent) Ah yes, High Rock. Home of exquisite Breton cuisine...",CHARACTER,Anton,male
"I know who you are, Anton Virane. And where you're from.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Who are you? What do you want?,CHARACTER,Anton,male
The Gourmet. Who is he? Where is he?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The...the Gourmet? Never! I don't know what led you here, but nothing will betray my trust. I'll take the secret of the Gourmet's identity to my grave.",CHARACTER,Anton,male
"For the Dark Brotherhood, that can be easily arranged. (Intimidate)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Dark Brotherhood? Now...now wait a minute. Let's not be hasty. I mean, surely my friend wouldn't want me to endanger my own life. Right? Look, his name is Balagog gro-Nolob. He's an Orc! The Gourmet's an Orc! He's staying at the Nightgate Inn! That's all I know! Now...now you'll let me go. Right?",CHARACTER,Anton,male
"Of course, Anton. Thank you. (Lie)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay. All right. Wonderful. You're welcome! I'll just be on my way, then...",CHARACTER,Anton,male
"I'm afraid not. Loose ends, and all that.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. Oh, please no...",CHARACTER,Anton,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
So...we're done?,CHARACTER,Anton,male
The player visits the Gourmet after disposing of Anton.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Whatever it is, I'm sure I can't be of help. I'm just here on... holiday.",CHARACTER,Balagog,male
You served your last meal...Gourmet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Gourmet? Why I... Um... Oh dear. You're going to kill me now, aren't you?",CHARACTER,Balagog,male
"Soon, the Emperor will die. Murdered, by the Gourmet.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? The Emperor? But I... Oh. Oh, by the gods, no. No, you can't do this. You can't!",CHARACTER,Balagog,male
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, well. Perhaps someone else in the village can assist you. Please, you're starting to...frighten me.",CHARACTER,Balagog,male
The player returns to the Sanctuary after stealing the Gourmet's writ.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, the prodigal murderer returns. And the Gourmet?",CHARACTER,Festus,male
Dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
If the job was done to the letter:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So I gathered. It seems a certain Orc has disappeared. Which means you not only killed the Gourmet, but disposed of the body as well. You've got the Writ of Passage too, I see. Splendid, splendid... Ah, and word has come in from Markarth that the keep's cook has met an untimely demise. You performed your duties to the letter. (Remain silent) You would expect any less from the Listener?",CHARACTER,Festus,male
All I've ever wanted to do is serve this Sanctuary.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. I was wrong about you. I see that now. Maybe we all were. Here's your payment. And...a little something extra, as well. From me. Consider it my way of apologizing. For being so damned curmudgeonly! It's called the Nightweaver's Band. I wore this for years. I want you to have it now. It'll give your magic and sneakiness some much needed ""oomph."" Now, you better get a move on and see Astrid. It's time! Time for the final stage of this grand and glorious operation!",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"If the job was done, but the body wasn't hidden:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Good, good. And you've got the Writ of Passage, too, I see. So there's that. I also received word from Markarth. It would seem Anton Virane has suffered an untimely fate, as well. Good. But unfortunately, that inn is abuzz with the news of somebody killing one of their guests! What, hiding the body was too much for you to handle? Bah! Useless. Here's your gold. Now go see Astrid. The time to move against the Emperor has finally come. Sithis help us all.",CHARACTER,Festus,male
The player reports to Astrid.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So it's done. You've killed the Gourmet. And now Titus Mede II is as good as dead.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
So it's time? We're ready to assassinate the Emperor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Oh yes. And I've decided you will have the honor.,CHARACTER,Astrid,female
"I won't disappoint you, Astrid. Or the Dark Brotherhood.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, I have the utmost faith in your success, believe me. So let's begin.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
The Emperor will die! For Sithis and the Night Mother!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. For Sithis...and the Night Mother. You are the Listener after all, hmm? So let's not waste any more time.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. Look at you. So calm. So confident. I do believe you were born for this task. So let's begin. Go now to Castle Dour in Solitude. Present the Gourmet's Writ of Passage to the officer in charge, Commander Maro. I'm sure you remember him. You'll gain unrestricted access to the kitchens, and then the Emperor. You're posing as a chef, so you'll be able to poison his meal rather easily.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Which poison I should use?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Here, take this -- it's called Jarrin Root. All it takes is one taste, and the effects are quite immediate. The Emperor will be serving Sithis before he even knows he's dead. Once Mede has been killed, escape through the upper door, and across the bridge. I've ""arranged"" for it to be unguarded once the alarm is sounded. Now go, my friend. Go, and fulfill your destiny as Listener.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
What else can you tell me about Jarrin Root?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's a rare plant, found only on the island of Stros M'Kai. It can be served like any vegetable -- cut up, put in a salad, perhaps boiled in a stew. One taste will lead to nearly instant death, so don't even think about it.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
Anything else before I set off?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It took all the favors, bribes, and blackmails I could muster, but I've secured your exit out of the keep. Just follow my instructions, and the Dark Brotherhood will be back on top. All thanks to you... Listener.",CHARACTER,Astrid,female
If one inquires to the other Family members before leaving...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You get to kill the Emperor. The bloody Emperor. You'd better enjoy this one. You owe us all that much. So make it bloody, painful, and spectacular.",CHARACTER,Arnbjorn,male
Don't take any chances with this one. Use the Jarrin Root to poison the Emperor's food. You're disguising yourself as a chef -- it only makes sense.,CHARACTER,Babette,female
"Ah, good to see you, brother. Gearing up to kill the Emperor? Exciting times. Exciting times, indeed. Well... While it's true I prefer sorcery's more destructive nuances, we mustn't forget the many spells with simpler, more practical applications. Sure, you poison the Emperor, but what then? Why not summon an atronach and cause some chaos? Or turn invisible and slip away? Use your imagination!",CHARACTER,Festus,male
"What an honor, the assassination of an Emperor. And all because you are the Listener, favored by the Night Mother, anointed by Sithis. I am so very happy for you. If not a bit...envious.",CHARACTER,Gabriella,female
"Yes. You're killing the Emperor himself. The Dark Brotherhood will get one shot at this, and you've been given the honors. So don't screw up.",CHARACTER,Nazir,male
"Astrid has arranged for your escape, no? Then you have nothing to worry about. Get in, kill the Emperor, and get out. Then, we celebrate.",CHARACTER,Veezara,male
The player heads for Castle Dour to see the commander. Penitus Oculatus agents are chatting outside.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"This city is crawling with Imperial Legion, and you know what? I'm still nervous. Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the Stormcloaks in line. No way I trust them with the Emperor's life.",CHARACTER,Agent 1,male
You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of threat.,CHARACTER,Agent 2,male
"I suppose. But what about the old man? Son killed, family name ruined...and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think he's even fit for duty?",CHARACTER,Agent 1,male
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best the Penitus Oculatus has ever produced. You should be half the man he is.,CHARACTER,Agent 2,male
"You misunderstand. It's just...I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll. That happened to me, I'd be a wreck.",CHARACTER,Agent 1,male
Maro is nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Stop right there. The tower is off limits until further notice.,CHARACTER,Gaius Maro,male
(Show Maro the Gourmet's Writ of Passage),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What's this now? ...order of his eminence... ...possessor of these papers...the ""Gourmet""... By Azura. The Gourmet! I...I'm sorry! I didn't realize! We...we had no idea when to expect you, you understand.",CHARACTER,Gaius Maro,male
You're not dressed as I would have expected...,CHARACTER,Gaius Maro,male
Your clothes... of course... I should have realized...,CHARACTER,Gaius Maro,male
"But please, don't let me keep you. Proceed to the kitchens straight away. Gianna, the castle chef, has been eagerly awaiting your arrival.",CHARACTER,Gaius Maro,male
The player tracks down Gianna.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Not another delivery. I told you people, our stocks are fine. Now put whatever you have over there, then get out!",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
You misunderstand. For I am...the Gourmet!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The...Gourmet? Oh! Finally! When I heard the Gourmet was being brought in to cook for the Emperor, I could hardly believe it. It's just...",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
Yes?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"• You're a Nord! I never would have guessed it! But where in the world did you learn to cook like that? Here in Skyrim? Or maybe somewhere less... • I guessed right!

"If the player already has the hat on, the delay is skipped.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Enough! The Gourmet is here to cook, not talk! Let us begin.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh! Yes, but of course. Ahem. The Emperor has requested your signature dish -- the Potage le Magnifique. I've taken the liberty of getting it started. But the cookbook only says so much, and everyone makes the Potage differently. I would be honored if we could make it...the Gourmet's special way. The base broth is already boiled. We can get started right now. So... Which ingredient should I add next?",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
Carrots.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Carrots? Really? Okay... What next?,CHARACTER,Gianna,female
A sweetroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ooooh...how decadent. I never would have guessed it. What next?,CHARACTER,Gianna,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, I get it. This is a test, right? You want to see how well I know the Potage le Magnifique. Well then, I think a pinch of frost salts should do the trick, right? Now what?",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
The next ingredient is...vampire dust.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Vampire dust? Seriously? Hmm... Yes, I guess I can see how that would add a more...earthy texture. And, oddly enough, we do have some on hand... All right, what next then?",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
You must now add a splash of mead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, of course. I suspected as much.",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My choice, then? Very well. I think we should add some Chaurus eggs. For additional flavor.",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
We shall now add...a giant's toe!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
A...giant's toe? You're...sure about that?,CHARACTER,Gianna,female
I said a giant's toe! Do not question the Gourmet!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course! I...I'm sorry. One giant's toe... There. What, um... What next?",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
One nirnroot.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Really? Oh, I use Nirnroot as a special seasoning all the time as well. What a wonderful idea. Okay, now what?",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ooookay... Um... Let me see. Thistle? Yes, let's try that. Just a sprig or two...",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
You must now add...a septim.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A Septim? As in...a gold coin? Really? Ah, I see now. The would give the Potage le Magnifique a slightly metallic -- but delicious -- aftertaste. Simply Brilliant. I have to say, the stew seems done.",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
Diced horker meat.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmmm...horker. So delicious. I swear, is there a soul alive who doesn't enjoy the taste of... Sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away. There we go, one cup of diced horker meat. I have to say, the stew seems done.",CHARACTER,Gianna,female
(Remain silent),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

We're done. Let us serve...the Potage le Magnifique!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Excellent. They should be ready for us now.,CHARACTER,Gianna,female

So was I, when a member of your ""Family"" came to me with the plan. We worked out a deal, you see. An exchange. I get you, and the Dark Brotherhood gets to continue its existence. But you know what? I've changed my mind. How about this? I kill you, and butcher each and every one of your miserable little friends? Your Sanctuary's being put to the sword right now.

What kind of security should I expect?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Surely you're joking? This is the true Emperor, not some half-Septim lookalike. He'll be surrounded by elite bodyguards, I'm sure. You'll have your work cut out for you.

"No, it's not as simple as that, but the Jagged Crown would be a potent symbol for his cause to rally around. But, if we found it first...",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
And we gave it to Elisif?,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"In the absence of the Moot, it would further legitimize her claim.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"Perhaps... I'm entrusting you with what resources I can spare. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be a waste of time and men...",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
It won't be a waste.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Make sure you take the Auxiliary here. You can send him back when you get there and find nothing but old bones and cobwebs.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The Stonefist's no fool. He's found the Crown. But we'll get to it first.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Rikke notices the player's waiting.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome back, soldier. I'm glad you made it in one piece. I'll send men to garrison the fort right away. You did well. I'm impressed. But before we go any further, it's time for you to officially join the Legion. Speak with General Tullius. He'll administer the oath.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"In joining the Legion, you'll be taking an oath binding you to the service of the Emperor and thus to every citizen of the Empire. Are you prepared to make that commitment?",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"Actually, I'm not sure. I need to think about it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see... Well, the Legion will still be here when you change your mind. Rikke believes in you. And I'm starting to see why. Consider this. What greater glory than to serve the Emperor and his citizens here in Skyrim, in these days of greatest need?",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
I'm ready to take the Oath.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

He'll get you outfitted. Now, if I'm not mistaken, Legate Rikke has a special assignment for you.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Rikke is sought out.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome to the Legion, auxiliary. Listen up. Ulfric's right-hand man, Galmar Stonefist, has located what he believes is the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. We're going to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it. The rest of my men are already assembling outside Korvanjund. I'll meet you there as soon as as I finish up here.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
One can question the Legate further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's the Jagged Crown?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A legendary crown, dating back to King Harald's time, or before. A powerful relic of a golden age, long since passed. Legend has it that the crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and is said to increase the power of the wielder. Whatever the truth, if Ulfric get's his hands on it, it would be a powerful symbol around which to rally support for his cause.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
How do we know the crown is in Korvanjund?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, to be frank, we don't. Its location was lost with King Borgas, when the Great Hunt killed him while off on his Alessian campaigns. Supposedly, his body was brought back to Skyrim and secretly buried with the crown. Knowledge of that location was lost, in the Wars of Succession. But my agents report that Galmar is pretty damned convinced Korvanjund is the tomb of King Borgas. I know Galmar. We fought in many wars together. He's not a sentimental man taken to fancy. If he believes the crown is there...he's likely found it.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Why do you fight for the Empire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am a loyal citizen to the Empire. My parents were Legionnaires, and I've followed in their footsteps. But more importantly, I am a daughter of Skyrim and wish to see her made whole again.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"Don't Stormcloaks call themselves ""sons and daughters of Skyrim""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've been a daughter of Skyrim all my life. I love this land and her people. So do all the Nords that serve the Empire. Ulfric, too, once. He wasn't always a self-serving ego-maniac. He fought in the Imperial army in the War against the Dominion. But Ulfric and his ""Stormcloaks"" are deluding themselves. If there's any hope of a long term victory against the Dominion, it's in the Empire. The rebels are only inflaming the tension and weakening the Empire by distracting it from its ultimate aim.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Do you consider the Thalmor enemies?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I consider this conversation over.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
So you have no problem with the treaty that bans the worship of Talos?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm a soldier, not a politician. And my personal beliefs are not yours to question.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
What will it take to end the war?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I hope Ulfric will come to his senses. But I fear he's in too far to stop now. Likely only Ulfric's death, or the overthrow of the Jarls supporting him will end this. Either way, much blood will be spilt.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
The player finds the ruin of Korvanjund near Windhelm. Rikke's team waits.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's the situation?,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"The Stormcloaks were already camped around the entrance when we got here. They don't know we're here yet, though.",CHARACTER,Imperial Soldier,male

She notices the player.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Looks like the damned rebels got here first. No matter, we have the element of surprise. Prepare to move out.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female

This isn't a damn summer picnic! Hurry up. We need to hit them before they know we're here.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"I'm ready, ma'am.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Follow me. Listen up, legionnaires. Those Stormcloaks are here for the same reason we are. Ulfric the Pretender wants that crown, but we're not going to let him have it. I realize some of you may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and will not hesitate to end your lives either. General Tullius is counting on us to bring back the Jagged Crown, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Let's show these rebels what real soldiers look like.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
They slay the Stormcloak vanguard and enter the ancient tomb.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Everybody ready? We charge on my signal. Time to show what you're really made of. For the Empire!,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
The nearest Stormcloaks are defeated.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You two, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Stormcloak reinforcements taking us by surprise. Everyone else, with me.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"A ways in is a long, thin stairway.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"But there isn't any other way through, Legate.",CHARACTER,Imperial Soldier,male
"Let's not jump to conclusions, soldier. The Legion always finds a way. I'd rather take a moment and look around than walk blindly into an ambush. Auxiliary, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting. There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"The player sneaks ahead, overhearing Stormcloaks.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You hear anything?,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 1 (ambush Jagged Crown),male
"No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut it or you'll ruin our ambush.",CHARACTER,Stormcloak 2 (ambush Jagged Crown),female
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 1 (ambush Jagged Crown),male
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 2 (ambush Jagged Crown),female
Hardly likely.,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 1 (ambush Jagged Crown),male
Just shut up and keep out of sight.,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 2 (ambush Jagged Crown),female
"The player kills them before they can ambush the Legate's men. Later, the group encounters a draugr's corpse.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What in the nine holds is that?,CHARACTER,Imperial Soldier,male
Is this what killed that Stormcloak over there? Can't be. It looks like it's been dead for a hundred years.,CHARACTER,Imperial Soldier,male
Steady now. The Legion has faced down worse than a few dusty old bonewalkers. We're not leaving here until we get what we came for. Now let's keep moving.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"Further on, they find a tunnel full of reliefs and murals.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
And this must be the Hall of Stories.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Oh...I've heard of this. The walls are supposed to show the history of the ancients who built this place.,CHARACTER,I. Soldier 1,male
Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?,CHARACTER,I. Soldier 2,male
One thing at a time soldier. Focus on our primary mission. We're searching for the crown.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
They find dead Stormcloaks near the puzzle-locked door.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Looks like we weren't the first ones here, either. Even if these carvings tell us where the crown is, I'm sure we're going to have to find a way through this door. See what you can figure out auxiliary, I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
The player finds an Ebony Claw laying near a corpse.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Hmm...what is that? Some kind of stone claw? I wonder what it's used for?,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"Using the claw's clues, one removes the puzzle impediment.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Good job! Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. Let's move out!,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
They reach a large chamber.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Alright legionnaires! Spread out and see what we've got. Auxiliary, do what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open. This may sound obvious, but do you see a lever anywhere?",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
The player finds a handle on the floor above.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Alright, let's move, men! We've got more...",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
The gate opening summons all the draugr from their coffins.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

Here's the Jagged Crown. Legate Rikke sent me to deliver it to you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Nothing I couldn't handle.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate Rikke.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
We lost a lot of good men. I hope it was worth it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's not for you to decide. Soldier. I wouldn't have sent you in the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The Stormcloaks were there ahead of us.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as perhaps I should have. But at least we ended up with the damn crown. Now then... I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun. We have it on good authority that Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl, however, refuses the Legion's support. This missive should convince him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence for the Jarl's eyes only.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male

I have an important message from General Tullius.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times must I deny him? Well? Out with it.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Ulfric plans to attack Whiterun. The General wants to lend Legion troops.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"• Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants. For now, give the papers to my steward. • I see... Give the papers to my steward.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
I was given strict instructions. For the Jarl's eyes only.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes. Just give me the letter. I presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good. • Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard? • Hmm...these are interesting reports...",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Once the nearby dragon problem is dealt with, the Jarl will look Tullius' note over with a bit more interest.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"As in all things, my lord, caution...I urge us to wait and see.",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
Prey awaits.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
I am of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
You plan to march on Windhelm?,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or to declare his intentions.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
He'll do no such thing!,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
He was rather straight forward with Torygg.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"That ""boy"" was High King of Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him. Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his ""Stormcloaks"" to do it for him.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place of your own men?,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
It seems cowardly.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The chests of gold didn't hurt.,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
Dammit! This isn't about gold!,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
It's time to decide.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.",CHARACTER,Proventus,male

Finally.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"• You there. I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the esteemed Jarl of Windhelm. Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak. • I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm sending you to Windhelm. Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
An axe?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe. If he returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps it, then we are at peace.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"And you think Ulfric will let me just walk in there, no trouble?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty man, but he's also a Nord that honors our traditions. Keep your wits about you and you won't be harmed. And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing, I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Should I say anything to him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Men who understand one another need not waste words. There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe. Ulfric will know my meaning.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Understood.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. Good...,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The player accepts.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male

"Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
i've brought a message from the Jarl of Whiterun.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around. Oh. What's this? Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity you've chosen the wrong side... You can return this axe to the man who sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain...visitors. I expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near future...,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
You've killed the High King. Why make war on your own people?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk, it makes us weak. I must now show them the path that will lead us back to our strength. There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat without threshing the chaff. The Empire and the Jarls who back them must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
You will be stopped.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried about.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
If you prefer I took my men and left...,CHARACTER,Cipius,male
No. Of course not. Just -- don't let me down Cipius. We'll need to set up water brigades to combat the flames.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male

Why side with the Empire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire. He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can.

"Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more cautious, eh? Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars are won by talented and exceptional individuals. I'm raising you to Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank. You've earned it.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"What are my new orders, sir?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for the Stormcloaks lined up.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
What exactly will I be doing in the field?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Yes sir.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
For the Empire!,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"The player next reaches the camp, south of Ivarstead and the Throat of the World. Rikke has once again spearheaded the operation here.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

"You're going to Riften. My spies report the Jarl's steward, Anuriel, has arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if made public. I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and use it to gain a measure of her ""cooperation."" This will require stealth and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging through her Steward's private quarters.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
I'm not sure. I need to think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
I'll get proof...and Anuriel's cooperation.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. I can always count on you, can't I?",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
One visits Riften's Mistveil Keep and finds an incriminating letter in the steward's bureau. Then it's time to threaten her.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Recognize this? (Show her incriminating letter),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not here. Come with me. Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.,CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
She leads the player to her chambers.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? Well, what is it you want?",CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
You rebels are doing a fine job destroying yourselves. Soldiers running errands?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting... I have no strong love for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire, either. This war of yours makes it different for a resourceful woman to advance her interests. Perhaps we can find a way for both of us to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?",CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
What if this letter were made public?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It would ruin me. I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible for her to admit that. Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces once offended. Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement?",CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
What kind of agreement did you have in mind?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?,CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
Go on. I'm listening.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've come to an agreement.",CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
"And what about something for me, right now? (Persuade)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well I...I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I? Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?",CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
How much are we talking about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Enough to make a significant difference in the war.,CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
"All right, it's a deal. Where can I find this shipment?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far. It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men. Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.",CHARACTER,Anuriel,female
The player delivers the news to the legate.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Something to report?,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Anuriel says there's a shipment of coin traveling to Windhelm...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful. It just so happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and together see if you can't overpower the caravan.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
The troops are near Shor's Watchtower. Hadvar is helping them.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I remember you...you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have you with us. How are you?",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
"I'm all right, I guess. How are you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good to hear.,CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
I've been better. And you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh? I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun. You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there... Do the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
Only a beast kills without feeling.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I suppose you're right...they say it gets easier... I'm not sure if that's a good thing...,CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
"If you hadn't killed them, they would have killed you.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's what I keep telling myself. But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
There's an enemy wagon loaded with coin and weapons. We need to capture it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now. So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?,CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
I blackmailed Anuriel for the information.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy. Lucky for us, that wagon recently had a little accident.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
It doesn't matter.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is. That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road! We're outnumbered, but I have a plan. You got here just in time.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
What's the plan?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking their camp. Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows. With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
"I have a better plan. You wait here, and I'll take care of it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like things have gotten out of hand.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
Let's wait a little longer.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Let me know when you're ready.,CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
Ready. Let's go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good.,CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
If they agree to fight as a team...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word. Fire!",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
The player kills the sentry quietly.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

"Either way, after slaying the Stormcloaks:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We make quite a team, eh? I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You get back to camp with news. Have them send some men -- with a new wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
One goes back to Rikke.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

"Your objective is Fort Greenwall. Meet the soldiers preparing for the attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we will garrison the fort. Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
I'm not sure. I need to think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
That fort is as good as ours.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I knew I could count on you, soldier.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"As before, one goes visits the fort and slays its Stormcloak inhabitants. As they lie bleeding, it's time to revisit the general for due accolades.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather nervous with us so close to his door step.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
"What are my new orders, sir?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
What exactly will I be doing in the field?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Yes sir.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Gods be with you.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
For the Empire!,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
The player can inquire about the hostilies' state.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How goes the war?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops garrisoned at home. By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll be there to stop him.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
What will it take to end the war?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ulfric Stormcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male

"Your objective is Fort Kastav. The rebels are keeping some of our men prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage. I've sent men to scout the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort. They won't be expecting an attack from the inside. This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you can handle it?",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
I'm not sure. I need to think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
That fort is as good as ours.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"Upon arrival, the player finds the scouting party is lead by Hadvar.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to icicles! What are we even doing up here? Guess Tullius wants to make sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for Eastmarch. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull this off.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
What's the plan?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in snow. I don't think they know it's there. From the look of it, I'd bet it leads straight into the prison. I need you to sneak in there, and free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard. We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
I'm on it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Talos preserve you.,CHARACTER,Hadvar,male
I'm not much for sneaking.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have faith in you. But, if you find more trouble than you can handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear fighting.",CHARACTER,Hadvar,male

"All right! It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak rebellion! You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring us to this point. Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the rubble to face justice. Because this is the end for them, the Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and crafty. But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and devastating. The Emperor will be paying close attention to what happens here today. Men who distinguish themelves will be well rewarded. Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the Legion! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!",CHARACTER,Tullius,male

No... But I belong to her.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male

Everyone goes outside to the waiting Imperial throng.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the walls of the Imperial City. Let this day be a final warning to all who would still call themselves Stormcloaks. We are turning the city over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man. Many of you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here. In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and compensation to the widows of your fallen comrades.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male

I hate giving speeches.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male
It wasn't so bad.,CHARACTER,Rikke,female
I hope we haven't just created a martyr.,CHARACTER,Tullius,male

"I pray you're right, Legate. In the meantime, we'll continue to root them out and put them to the sword.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
He turns to the player.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

Tullius can be asked about the aftermath.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now that Ulfric is dead, will there be peace?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but by in large, the people here desire peace. What I'm not so sure about is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll kee that between the two of us, alright?",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Will you return to Cyrodiil now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years. Can't say I'll ever get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords...but, I've come to respect them. The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Is there anything further I can do for the Legion?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you elsewhere. That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on you travels, kill them. With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all to the sword.",CHARACTER,Tullius,male
Rikke can be asked about the aftermath.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now that Ulfric is dead, will there be peace?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to fight us, and bring misery to the people...but they are few in number. The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to have their families return home. And they should enjoy it while they can...I suspect all of Tamriel will againb e called to arms in the not too distant future.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
What's next for the accomplished Legate Rikke?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments. I may understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best. This is the land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part in making it strong again.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
Is there anything further I can do for the Legion?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world. If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the hills.",CHARACTER,Rikke,female
"Like the Imperial side, one overhears talk of joining the Stormcloaks, based Stone-Fist, will be talking.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"If he's not with us, he's against us.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
He knows that. They all know that.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
How long are you going to wait?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful statement, don't you think?",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Soon.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them with will need the support of our armies.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
We're ready when you are.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed all the better. But if not...,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
The people are behind you.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Many I fear still need convincing.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Then let them die with their false kings.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The people are still weighing things in their hearts.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
What's left of Skyrim to wager?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
They have families to think of.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their families.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil. I fight for their wives and children, who's names I heard whispered in their last breaths. I fight for we few who did come home, only to find our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces. I fight for my people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves! I fight so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing. I fight...because I must.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you will be High King. But the day words are enough, will be the day soldiers like us are no longer needed.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
The player walks over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Only the foolish or the courageous approach the Jarl without summons... Do I know you?,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I believe we've already met.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Is that so...? Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I was at Helgen.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ahhh. Yes... Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I helped Ralof escape. He said he'd vouch for me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man. But he hasn't returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak with Galmar.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
I was set free. I could've gone anywhere. I came here to fight the Empire.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak with Galmar. I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it out of Helgen. Seems we're all branded villains these days... So long as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"If one is far enough in the main quest, Ulfric may instead say this, before giving the usual chatty options:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war? Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Yes, sir.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
That's not why I'm here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar. What does bring you to me?",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
One finds Galmar nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through that, you're likely worth something to me. But first, tell me. Why's a foreigner want to fight or Skyrim?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Skyrim is my home.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I want to fight the Empire. I'll bleed for the chance to do so.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much as I do, that I can work with.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
That's why I'm here. I want to join.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much you can take. I have a little test for you.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I can handle anything you throw at me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's what I like to hear. So long as you can back up those words with steel.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
What kind of test?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The kind men use to measure themselves. I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
What's at Serpentstone Island?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's where men have tested their mettle for ages. There's a strange rock formation there, built by the ancients. Something about that place attracts the Ice Wraiths. You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and I'll have the proof I need about you.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Does every recruit have to do this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but more importantly, it will prove your commitment.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm going alone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not so sure of yourself after all?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"At the end of the day, every warrior is alone. Before you can stand next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm not sure about this.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a Stormcloak.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm off to kill that Ice Wraith. I'll be back soon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We'll see about that, won't we?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"The glacial island is found off the northeast coast of Skyrim. Sure enough, Him and the Jarl are discussing another matter fervently.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Tell me again why we're wasting time and resources chasing a legend. We don't even know it exists!,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Damn the Jarls.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
They demand the Moot.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
And damn the Moot! We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put Torygg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on a silver plate.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
A crown doesn't make a king.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"No, but this one...",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
If it even exists.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause. Think about it. The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before jarls and moots. Back to a time when a king was a king because his enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him. Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
You're certain you've found it?,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
When have I ever been false with you?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you. Fancy a crawl through a moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
It'll be there. You'll see.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
They finish talking. Galmar walks over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think we'd be seeing you again. I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak material. It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Are you saying you sent me out there to die?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your resolve. I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me wrong. And I respect that. Now, if were done being sentimental, it's time for you to take the Oath.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Oath?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim. You must also pledge unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her people.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Isn't it enough that I want to fight Imperials?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that doesn't make you a Stormcloak. We're not just fighting Imperials. We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king she deserves.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I need to think it over.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation for Imperial sympathies. Come back when you're committed to the cause, or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm ready to take the Oath.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's the spirit.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
The player agrees to take the oath.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What's the Jagged Crown?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Have you not heard that ancient verse? ""Maw unleashing razor snow, Of dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe, The High King in his Jagged Crown."" Going way back to King Harald's time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It was the symbol of his might and power. The crown is made from the bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion of the power of every king who has worn it. True or not, who would dare deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his brow?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
How do you know the crown is in Korvanjund?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian campaigns. But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following Wars of Succession. Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King Borgas -- Korvanjund. If the crown exists, it will be there.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
You anticipate danger?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what profane arts those elves cursed his remains. Curses nonwithstanding, the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers, are they not? But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure you.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male

"Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together, eh? I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my blood, and I don't care who knows it.",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good advice, I'd say. But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and nothing's going to stand in our way.",CHARACTER,Ralof,male

"Hail, Galmar.",CHARACTER,Stormcloak Soldier (Ilfhild),female
What's the situation?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their fires.",CHARACTER,Stormcloak Soldier (Ilfhild),female
"Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip in and send them to their graves that way.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Galmar sees the player's arrived.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet. Ready to spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Hold on. I need a minute.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter. Get yourself ready!,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm ready. Let's go get them.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's what I like to hear. Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence. Their spies must have found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us to have it. But they won't stand in our way. I know some of you are ex-legion and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you. Keep your wits about you and watch your shield brother's back. Ulfric Stormcloak is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what we are going to do. Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their guts on the ground before they even know we're here.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
They slaughter the gate guards and slip inside undetected.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one they're just waiting for us on the other side.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
But there isn't any other way through.,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 1 (with Galmar),female
"You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in there. We'll stay here and watch your back... Not so sure? Oh, then perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh? You there, Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to help as soon as we hear fighting. There may be some way to get through on the level above. Hurry!",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"Using the upper route, the player reconnoiters, overhearing two sentries.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You hear anything?,CHARACTER,Imperial 1,male
"No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now shut up or you'll blow our ambush.",CHARACTER,Imperial 2,male
I don't like it. What are they waiting for?,CHARACTER,Imperial 1,male
Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.,CHARACTER,Imperial 2,male
Hardly likely.,CHARACTER,Imperial 1,male
Just shut up and keep out of sight.,CHARACTER,Imperial 2,male

Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 2 (with Galmar),male
No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 1 (with Galmar),female
Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than the Imperials could. We're not leaving until we get what we came for. Now let's keep moving.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"They progress deeper into the crypt, coming upon the tunnel and puzzle lock.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Ah! The Hall of Stories...we must be getting close now.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Oh...I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of the ancients who built this place.,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 1 (with Galmar),female
Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets we'd uncover?,CHARACTER,Stormcloak 2 (with Galmar),male
One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings show a crown?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
An Imperial corpse is nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got. Even if one of these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to have to find a way through that door. See what you can figure out, Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know if you find something.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
The corpse has a claw nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Hmm...that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what it's used for.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male

Draugr pop out of the coffins.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes me a drink. We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find anything else useful.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
The headgear is delivered to Ulfric personally.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here's the Jagged Crown. I believe you owe Galmar a drink?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Damn him -- the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Nothing I couldn't handle.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets back.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
We lost a lot of good men. I hope it was worth it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it. Also, never doubt me or Galmar.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
The Imperials were there ahead of us.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere. Never forget that... I trust you gave them a thrashing? Now then... I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to the Jarl of Whiterun. Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
An axe?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim. Give the man my axe. If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means war.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Should I say anything to him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Men who understand each other often have no need for words. There are but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe. Balgruuf will know my meaning.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Understood.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"The Jarl's sought out at Dragonsreach, the hilltop castle overlooking his fair city.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak asked me to deliver this axe to you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that. • But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to wait. For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at best. Now I believe you have some business to conclude with my court wizard? • I suppose it's time I give him an answer... Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"As in all things, Lord, caution...I urge us to wait and see.",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
Prey waits.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
I'm of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
You plan to march on Windhelm?,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could expect!,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
He was rather straight forward with Torygg.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"That ""boy"" was the High King of Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to challenge my rule in the old way, let him. Though I suspect he'll prefer to send his ""Stormcloaks"" to do it for him.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove his army's.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean, if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with the Empire.",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place of your own men?,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
It seems cowardly.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told. And we had to like it.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
The chests of gold didn't hurt.,CHARACTER,Proventus,male
Dammit! This isn't about gold!,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
It's time to decide.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"Oh, he's serious. But so am I.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Finally.,CHARACTER,Irileth,female
So about this axe... You can return this axe to our friend. The esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it. Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Are we writing a letter, Lord?",CHARACTER,Proventus,male
"Yes, to General Tullius. I need to make a few things clear before I accept these Legionnaires of his.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
One returns to Ulfric with the grim tidings.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The Jarl of Whiterun returns your axe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then I was wrong about him. You were right Galmar.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Again?,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm in no mood to joke.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Whiterun is only a means to an end.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric... Whenever you are.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Is a man ever ready to give the orders that will mean the deaths of many.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must. But you are that man, Ulfric. You've been that man before, and you'll be him again. And these men and women -- they call themselves Stormcloaks because they believe in you... They are the meanest, toughest sons of bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this. They want this as much as you do. Perhaps they want it more.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"You're certain we're ready? Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered by Legionnaires. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they still stand.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"We're ready. And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls down with my bare feet! -- if you would only ask me to do it!",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"And I'm sure you could do it, too. Alright. This is it.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Yes!,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"Send the word. ""A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun.""",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords flashing.",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
So it begins. Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the front lines. I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that battlefield. I need you there.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Yes, sir!",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fight well, or die well.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
Many will die by my hand.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in. Talos be with you!,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack. Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
The player travels to the Stormcloaks' catapult-filled camp in Whiterun's countryside.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"This is it, men!",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What is that?",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
"They storm the gates, destroying the chevaux-de-frise and approaching the Dragonsreach.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Halt in the name of the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater!",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my own sword.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Stay back, lord!",CHARACTER,Irileth,female
"Soon, the jarl is brought to heel.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Enough! That's enough. I surrender...I surrender. Peace! Everyone stand down. That's an order. Stand down!,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"Hostilities over, a prominent Whiterun citizen enters the castle.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Balgruuf!,CHARACTER,Vignar,male
Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls... Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
You think this is personal? The Empire has no place in Skyrim... Not any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.,CHARACTER,Vignar,male
"A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what then? We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people should know that.",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
"If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul? We should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor. Skyrim needs a High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will do the same.",CHARACTER,Vignar,male
"Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it? How many of those corpses lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend? What about their families?",CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Enough! Both of you! There is a burning city out there that needs a government.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
"He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order.",CHARACTER,Vignar,male
This isn't over. You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
He turns to the player.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to regret this day.,CHARACTER,Balgruuf,male
Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.,CHARACTER,Ralof,male
The victory is soon reported to Ulfric.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good. We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep. We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has seeped into your heart. Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
What's our next move against the Empire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit. But I also want you to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
What exactly will I be doing out there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male

Go with the gods.,CHARACTER,Ulfric,male

Reporting in.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're going to Fort Neugrad. They have some of our boys locked up there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage. I've sent some men to scout the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort. They'll never suspect an attack from the inside. This won't be easy. But that's why I'm sending you. You got the grit to get this done?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
I'm not sure. I need to think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than fight for the people of Skyrim?",CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Nothing I can't handle.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We all have faith in you.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male
Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.,CHARACTER,Galmar,male

Good to hear.,CHARACTER,Ralof,male
I've been better. And you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make things better, eh? I guess I'm doing all right. I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they promoted me after Whiterun. You know, some nights when I close my eyes, I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there... Do the men you killed still haunt you? Mine do...",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
Only a beast kills without feeling.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I suppose you're right...they say it gets easier... I'm not sure if that's a good thing...,CHARACTER,Ralof,male

So what's the plan? / What's the plan?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Straight to business with you, huh? Well, it just so happens I have the perfect mission for you. We found a cave under the lake. With luck, it'll lead into the prison. I need you to sneak in there, free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the prisoners, head out to the courtyard. We'll stand guard out here and rush in as soon as we hear fighting. Should be fun.",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
I'm on it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You should wait until night fall before trying to sneak in.,CHARACTER,Ralof,male
Talos preserve you.,CHARACTER,Ralof,male
I'm not much for sneaking.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I have faith in you.,CHARACTER,Ralof,male

News is brought to Ulfric.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you thus. The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it and the people...but I've kept a little something to offer you in appreciation. Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and sisters. And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd like to offer you a home in Windhelm.

But, if confronted with proof of his belief, you might be able to ""persuade"" him to aid our cause, indirectly of course. Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?

Suffice it to say, he is no friend of Markarth, and no friend of mine. My first and only loyalties are to my nephew, and to this city.",CHARACTER,Raerek,male
What if this were made public?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Thalmor would need to make an example of me...I'd be thrown into prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations. I'm the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city.",CHARACTER,Raerek,male
Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Enough to make a significant difference in the war.,CHARACTER,Raerek,male
"All right, it's a deal. Where can I find this shipment?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch them before they get far. It'll be a fairly slow moving caravan. The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men. Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.",CHARACTER,Raerek,male

Ralof is found once again at the meeting spot.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hey there! I was wondering when I'd run into you out here. The Reach is a beautiful but dangerous place, eh?

You have the look of purpose in your eyes.",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
There's an enemy wagon loaded with coin and weapons. We need to capture it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day now. So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know that?,CHARACTER,Ralof,male
I blackmailed Raerek for the information.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in handy. Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now. Just up the road!",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
It doesn't matter.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is. That wagon recently had a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road. We're outnumbered, but I have a plan. You got here just in time.",CHARACTER,Ralof,male
What's the plan?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate ourselves overlooking the camp. Next, you'll infiltrate their position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows. With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a little.",CHARACTER,Ralof,male

It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would have us deny our gods and our heritage. It was you who fought your kin who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price of our freedom. But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim, for our right to fight our own battles... To return to our glory and our traditions, to determine our own future!

I do!,CHARACTER,Elisif,female

No, you're free to roam. I suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere.

"So, do I call you High King now?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be better for all that way. But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting like it. There's much to do.

Though the biggest threat, of course, is the elves.",CHARACTER,Ulfric,male
"Now that we've defeated the Imperials, will there be peace?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

What's next for the mighty Galmar Stone-Fist?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You know, make sure they're generally following orders. Can't say I'm looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for their new armies. The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the elves soon enough.

Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg. Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is no justice in the world.,CHARACTER,Elisif,female
"So, do you still claim to be High Queen of Skyrim?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his widow, I am in no position to claim such a title. Ulfric Stormcloak is victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line. It seems I will never take my rightful place as High Queen.",CHARACTER,Elisif,female

"Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to buy.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What a waste of time.,CHARACTER,Madesi,male
Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.,CHARACTER,Brand-Shei,male
"As the crowd disperses, Brynjolf seeks the player out.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Looks like I chose the right person for the job. And here you go... your payment, as promised. The way things have been going around here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What's been going on?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose that's just how it goes. But never mind that, you did the job and you did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from...if you think you can handle it.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I can handle it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Alright, then. Let's put that to the test. The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern called the Ragged Flagon. Get there in one piece and we'll see if you really have what it takes.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"The money's nice, but I don't know.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look, I'll make this simple for you. The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern called the Ragged Flagon. When you make up your mind, come find me there and we can talk about your future.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
No way. It was wrong to do those things.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up. The group I represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern called the Ragged Flagon. When you come to your senses, find me there and we'll discuss your future.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Defeating the foes in the Ratway, the player reaches the hidden tavern 'neath the city. Brynjolf and some of his cohorts are discussing the player.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Give it up, Brynjolf...those days are over.",CHARACTER,Vekel,male
"I'm telling you, this one is different...",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"We've all hear that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.",CHARACTER,Dirge,male
"It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer... you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!",CHARACTER,Vekel,male
"Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Well, well...color me impressed, lad. I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again!",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Getting here was easy.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize! So...now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I almost got killed!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used to it. Now, if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Don't know why I bothered. This place is a mess.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for this line of work. Our methods require secrecy and discretion. Now, if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Deadbeats? What'd they do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay. I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Sounds good. Who are they?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga. Do this right and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
How do you want me to handle it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored. A word of warning, though...I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Consider it done.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Will I get a cut?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own. Now, if you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What's Haelga's story?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue to the Divine which she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage and she'll cave.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Any tips about Keerava?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for her family. Talk to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something out of him. They're...well-acquainted, if you catch my meaning.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Any help with Bersi?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find. The key is that ugly dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change his attitude.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
The player goes to see Bersi Honey-Hand at his pawn shop.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have a message from Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Wha...what? Oh, it's one of you people. So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?",CHARACTER,Bersi,male
"Simple. You don't pay, bad things happen.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Petty threats and fist-waving are not going to sway me. You people are all talk and everyone knows it!,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
We can protect ourselves. Trust me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are run out of Riften.,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
I think you know what it is.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even protect yourselves? Ridiculous!,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
We can protect ourselves. Trust me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
(same as above),CHARACTER,Bersi,male
I've had enough of this.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to leave!",CHARACTER,Bersi,male
I think you need to shut your mouth. (Brawl),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm going to make you sorry for this!,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
If Bersi is beaten up:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Please, no more! I'll pay, I'll pay! Here.",CHARACTER,Bersi,male
If the urn is destroyed.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Stop! That's priceless!,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
Oh my word!,CHARACTER,Drifa,female
No! That urn was priceless!,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
You want me to break anything else?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash anything else. Here! Take your gold and leave me in peace.,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
If the urn is destroyed before speaking to Bersi:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I can't believe you're doing this! Stop! No! That urn was priceless!,CHARACTER,Bersi,male
That was from Brynjolf. Get the message?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can't believe you did that! You people are monsters! You demand payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves! Here, take your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.",CHARACTER,Bersi,male
"If Bersi is the last of the three left, he'll already be intimidated:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?",CHARACTER,Bersi,male
I have a message from Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not to worry about it anymore. Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed. Here, take it.",CHARACTER,Bersi,male
The player goes to Haelga's bunkhouse.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have a message for Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get blood from a stone.,CHARACTER,Haelga,female
This isn't about the money anymore.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be reasonable. I'll...I'll pay next month.",CHARACTER,Haelga,female
We've run out of patience.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the sewer. You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you a single coin.,CHARACTER,Haelga,female
Then you'll pay in more than just coin. (Brawl),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ha! We'll see about that.,CHARACTER,Haelga,female
If Haelga is beaten up:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Here...take your damn coin and get out of here!,CHARACTER,Haelga,female
If her Dibella statue is taken.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have left!,CHARACTER,Haelga,female
I have a message from Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You...you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?,CHARACTER,Haelga,female
"So, should I drop this statue down a well?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not Lady Dibella! No, please! I can't lose her! I get the message. Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!",CHARACTER,Haelga,female
"If Haelga is the last of the three, she'll already be intimidated.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"It's you! Please, don't hurt me!",CHARACTER,Haelga,female
I have a message from Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city. Please, there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have the payment!",CHARACTER,Haelga,female
"The player goes to shakedown Keerava, an Argonian at the bar.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have a message from Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I've already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single coin!,CHARACTER,Keerava,female
It was never a request.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's seen to that.",CHARACTER,Keerava,female
I'm finished wasting my time talking to you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good, and take this little message back to your bosses: I'm not paying any of you a single septim...ever! Now get out of my inn!",CHARACTER,Keerava,female
Don't say I didn't warn you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Come on, give it your best shot!",CHARACTER,Keerava,female
If Keerava is beaten up:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Please, stop! I'll pay up! Take it.",CHARACTER,Keerava,female
"If one learns about Keerava's family from Talen-Jei, another Argonian:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Are you ready to pay Brynjolf what you owe?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn.",CHARACTER,Keerava,female
Maybe I should visit that farm in Morrowind...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
How could you possibly know about... Please. My family means too much to me. Don't hurt them.,CHARACTER,Keerava,female
Then pay up and I'll forget about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have no more trouble from me.,CHARACTER,Keerava,female
"If Keerava is the last of the three, she'll already be intimidated.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have a message from Brynjolf.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I'm sorry, yes? Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear.",CHARACTER,Keerava,female
"With all three merchants shaken down, the player returns to Ragged Flagon.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all, you did it clean. I like that. Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can be expensive.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Here's what they owed us.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return. Here you go, I think you'll find these quite useful.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
He gives some potions as recompense.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"What's next, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Judging from how well you've handled those shopkeepers, I'd say you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you in our outfit.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"If there's more gold where that came from, I'm in.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood...the telltale sign of a practiced thief. I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Before we go, I have to ask...",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What's on your mind?,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Word is your outfit isn't doing well. True?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned about. Tell you what: you keep making us coin and I'll worry about everything else. Fair enough?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Fair enough.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll show you what you're all about.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Brynjolf leads the player through a hidden door into the Thieves Guild's real domain, a cistern beyond the Ragged Flagon. The guildmaster is waiting.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Mercer? This is the one I was talking about...our new recruit.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf. Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich. You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions... you do what we say, when we say. Do I make myself clear?",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Yes, I understand.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
I'm not sure.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again, are we clear on all of this?",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Rules? We're thieves. What's the point of rules?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all of this?",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Wait a moment... You're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it. Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients. However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands, and shut us out. He needs to be taught a lesson. Brynjolf will provide you with the details.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Hmm? Oh, yes... Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Mercer walks off.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin, so don't disappoint me.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
So how do I get my cut of the spoils?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a profit by killing. You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some extra jobs your way. Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon...she'll set you up with your new armor.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Tell me about the Goldenglow job.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's run by some smart-mouth wood elf named Aringoth. We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of his estate's hives,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What's the catch?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground. That important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Who cares, we're the Thieves Guild.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly. Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Makes sense.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What's so important about these clients?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly. Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What should I do about Aringoth?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him. The Guild has a lot riding on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I need more details about Goldenglow.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal. Then out of the clear blue, Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was...well, angry, to put it kindly. So we send in Vex to find out he's hired a bunch of mercenaries to guard the place.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Mercenaries? Not Riften guards?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire island. In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should talk to her about it before you go.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
How do I destroy the bee hives?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their one weakness is flame. Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften we mean business than a huge column of smoke.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Why not level the entire estate?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll give you one good reason: Maven Black-Briar. Burn all the hives and she'd have to import for Black-Briar Meadery, which would cut into her profits.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Maven Black-Briar is the influential client?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing. If the workers had a dispute, we rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments. In return, Maven allowed us to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"So, how dangerous is it to cross her?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Let me put it to you this way: nothing happens in Riften without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend the rest of the fourth era in prison.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
The player prepares to leave.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take prisoners.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Optionally, one can ask Vex about her encounter.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I heard you ran into trouble at Goldenglow.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph, yeah, I did. That wood elf s'wit...he's a lot smarter than I expected. Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard? There must have been eight of them in there. It was like he was daring us to come and get him.",CHARACTER,Vex,female
Any tips to get me in there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the northwest side of the island. That's how I slipped in there. Should still be unguarded.",CHARACTER,Vex,female
If the player finds Aringoth upstairs:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Worthless mercenaries. I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow me to get away with this, but I had little choice.",CHARACTER,Aringoth,male
I just want the key to your safe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat.",CHARACTER,Aringoth,male
What makes you think I won't? (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I don't believe you. That's not your way.,CHARACTER,Aringoth,male
Then I'll take it off your corpse!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Give it your best shot!,CHARACTER,Aringoth,male
Forget it. I'll just open it myself.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard for!,CHARACTER,Aringoth,male
If the player returns to Brynjolf after destroying too many hives:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You've made a mess and Maven is furious. I told you not to burn more than three of the hives! I've smoothed things over with her for now, but you can forget your cut.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Sorry. Here's what was in the safe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
If the player returns to Brynjolf after doing a satisfactory job:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Yes, and here's what was in the safe.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let me take a look at what you found. Aringoth sold Goldenglow? What's that idiot thinking? He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out. If only the parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol. Any idea what that may be?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
No idea.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and ask Mercer. But for now, you're off to speak with Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by name.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Good, it's about time I met her.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I thought I did the job like you asked...?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Sure, but will I come out of there alive?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd be calling the Dark Brotherhood. It's just business.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What does Maven want from me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way. • Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine. • Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve quite a bit of gold for her people.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Speaking of which...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course...your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad. Keep doing right by us and there'll be plenty more where that came from.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Dragonborn tracks down Maven in Riften. If the player fouled things up:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So you're the one who burned down Goldenglow Estate. Do you have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to cost me? I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face here.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
"My apologies, Lady Maven.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's assurance you won't botch another assignment. He claims you possess some sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find that hard to believe.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
If the player did the Goldenglow job right:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
I'm the best at what I do.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Is that confidence I hear...or arrogance? Strange how often they're confused.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Sorry you're disappointed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is exactly what I'm talking about. Once again Brynjolf sends me someone with no backbone, no determination.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
How about we skip the conversation?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me anyone I can rely on.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
You have no faith in the guild?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Faith? I don't have faith in anyone. All I care about is cause and effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray area.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
You won't have that problem with me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I hope not. This is an important job. I have a competitor called Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business. I also want to know how they got the place up and running so quickly.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Where do I begin?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and ask for Mallus Maccius. He'll fill you in on all the details.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Who runs the Honningbrew Meadery?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Some layabout named Sabjorn. Been a thorn in my side for the last few years now.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Sabjorn seems like more than just friendly competition.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he did. In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to market and a chunk of my profits with it! I can't imagine where he found the gold to take it to market so quickly.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
So get rid of him and he's no longer a threat.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close. Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
Why strike now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of honey that I need to make my mead. Sabjorn could use this interruption to his advantage and take a larger share of the market. I can't have that.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
How did you become Allied with the Thieves Guild?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit. I dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does to its own people.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be sorry.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
The player travels to Whiterun's inn.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Can't a man drink in peace?,CHARACTER,Mallus,male
Maven said you're expecting me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do. Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's Captain of the Guard, and we're going to poison the mead.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
You have the poison?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn to give it to us. The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what I mean?",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
How do I fit in?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand. He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also going to dum it into the brewing vat.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
Clever.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you to get in there and get it done. Now get going before Sabjorn grows a brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.,CHARACTER,Mallus,male
How do I get to the brewing vats?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests infesting the meadery. There's an entrance to it in the basement storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over. I've already removed the boards so the meadery would be infested. That's where you should start.,CHARACTER,Mallus,male
What about just going in through the brewery?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way, go right ahead.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
Why are you doing all this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone! He treats me like a slave...I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
"There's more to this than a debt, isn't there?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for life. Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in jail, she's going to take over his meadery. And guess who gets to run the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
Why bother poisoning the nest for Sabjorn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One way or another, we don't want the pests coming back. Consider it just more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you need to clear them out. Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
The Dragonborn goes to the meadery. Dead rats lie near the serving counter.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
Is something wrong?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Are you kidding me? Look at this place. I'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard. If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
I might be able to help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness of your heart, would you? I hope you're not expecting to be paid until the job's done.",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
That's the only way I operate. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
"You better, or I yell ""skeever."" (Intimidate)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions. Here's half. You get the rest when the job's done. My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
Just pay me when the job's done.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
"How do I ""permanently"" clear the vermin?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished. If you plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming back.",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
You've got a deal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
I haven't finished the job yet.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Why are you standing here then? I've told the Captain of the Guard we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here any minute.,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
You mentioned someone named Mallus?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back. Nothing like free labor to make operating costs cheaper. Now I've got to clean up this mess.,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
"After killing the rats and the human living with them, the mead is poisoned. The Dragonborn returns for his payment.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Job's finished.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were finished.,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
What about my pay?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I suppose you can wait around if you must.,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
"Well, Sabjorn, now that you've taken care of your little pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?",CHARACTER,Caius,male
"Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet...I call it Honningbrew Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
"Oh, come now. This is mead, not some wine meant to be sipped and savored. By the Eight?! What...what's in this?",CHARACTER,Caius,male
I...I don't know. What's wrong?,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
You assured me this place was clean! I'll see...see to it that you remain in irons for the rest of your days!,CHARACTER,Caius,male
"No, please! I don't understand...",CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
"Silence, idiot! I should have known better...to trust this place after it's been riddled with filth.",CHARACTER,Caius,male
I beg you...please! This is not what it seems!,CHARACTER,Sabjorn,male
You...you're in charge until I can sort this all out.,CHARACTER,Caius,male
It will be my pleasure.,CHARACTER,Mallus,male
And you...you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly your memory cleans in the city's prisons. Now move.,CHARACTER,Caius,male
"Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
I said move!,CHARACTER,Caius,male
"Farewell, Sabjorn.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
Caius and his prisoner leave.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I don't think that could have gone any better. Anything else you need before you head back to Riften?,CHARACTER,Mallus,male
I need to get a look at Sabjorn's books.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh? You're welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his papers stashed in his desk. Here, this should help.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
What are you going to do with this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery as soon as possible. That was Maven's part of the deal. She's put me in charge of keeping the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do. If you're in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
You never mentioned that lunatic living in the tunnels.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the job. Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later. Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.",CHARACTER,Mallus,male
"After finding a promissory note, it's time to report back to the Guild.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I trust you have good news for me.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Job's finished. Here's the information you requested.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that can identify Sabjorn's partner is this odd little symbol.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Yes. I've seen that symbol before.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret starting a war with me. You should bring this information to the Thieves Guild immediately. There's also the matter of your payment. I believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
Back at Brynjolf's...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Yet very fortunate for Maven.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works. Maven sent word that you'd discovered something else while you were out there. Something important to the Guild?,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
The same symbol from Goldenglow was involved.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn. Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven and the Guild.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Is there anything we can do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side. He wants to meet with you right away. And if I were you, I'd hurry. I've never seen him this angry before.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
The player finds Mercer at his usual desk in the cistern.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, there you are. I've consulted my contacts regarding the information you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that symbol.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
I found the same marking at Honningbrew Meadery.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It would see our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
You admire them?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for years. I'm surprised it reached this point. Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Maybe we should recruit them.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You just, but they've been able to avoid detection for years. They're obviously well-funded, driven and patient. Just don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Clever or not, they need to die.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient and have been able to avoid identification for years. However, don't mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
How can we make them pay?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a mistake. The parchment you recovered mentions a ""Gajul-Lei"". According to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts. His real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Where do I begin?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude. I'm betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and that he can finger our buyer. Get out there, shake him down and see what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have any questions. Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
If one goes to get extra info:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian couldn't find his tail with both hands. Don't get me wrong. He could scam a beggar out of his last septim...but he's no mastermind.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Think he'll give me trouble?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You have your work cut out for you.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
So how do I get him to talk?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his attention. If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use it as leverage.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Betrayal or not, I'll let him live.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire story. Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape off his boot.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
He's going to owe us for this betrayal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, he does indeed...and with his fingers in the East Empire Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt. If I'm not being clear enough, that means we don't want him killed. For now, just keep on his tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape off his boot.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"If he's betrayed us, I'll kill him.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, no, Mercer wants him alive. For now. Stubborn or not, he's the only contact we have at the East Empire Company. Just keep on his tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape off his boot.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
East Empire Company? Who are they?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry. The Emperor himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly unlimited resources...so don't get their feathers in a ruffle.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"If I get information from Gulum-Ei, what then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer. Nothing else is more important. If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding out on us and hs more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find that information quite valuable as well.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
You think Gulum-Ei will give me trouble?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There are thieves and there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all. He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. The cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying. Keep your eyes on him; he's quite crafty.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
How is Gulum-Ei an asset to the Guild?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company warehouse. He helps maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of Solitude. That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores. He isn't exactly in the Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the warehouse. Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we are.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
The Argonian is found at Solitude's Winking Skeever tavern.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, what do we have here? Hmm...let me guess. By your scent, I'd say you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
I'm here about Goldenglow Estate.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods, you've come to the right person.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
You can drop the act now...Gajul-Lei.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, wait...did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies. I'm sorry to say I know very little about that...bee farm, was it?",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
You acted as a broker for its new owner.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every deal I handle.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Identify the buyer and we'll forget what we know. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and word gets around, it could ruin me!",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
What would it take to identify the buyer? (Bribe),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying to get my hands on. I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace. Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Give me the buyer's name or I'll kill you. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything? You kill me and your only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart for business.,CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
"Dragonborn steals a case of wine from the jarl's palace, then returns.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have the Firebrand Wine.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk. Good. Can't have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can we? Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need to pay you something for the goods.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
You're trying to bribe me now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life. As far as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know. I was approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for something big. She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate. I brought him the coin and walked away with her copy of the deed.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Did she say why she was doing this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the job. I'm sure you understand. However, I did notice she was quite angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
That's it? No name or anything?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how much coin we carry.,CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
I think you're lying to me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the answers. Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
The broker leaves and gets tailed into the East Empire Warehouse. Gulum-Ei fact he's soon confronts him over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now, there's no need to do anything rash... This isn't as bad as it seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly! Please...he'll have me killed!",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Mercer doesn't have to know.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I see you wish to be reasonable. Perhaps I misjudged you. The name of the person you want is Karliah.,CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
"Tell me first, and then I'll decide.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Alright, alright... It's Karliah...her name is Karliah.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Tell me now or I'll kill you where you stand!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything. It's Karliah...her name is Karliah.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
You say that name like I should know it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Mercer never told you about her? Karliah is the thief responsible for murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
And you're helping her?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Help...? No, no! Look, I didn't even know it was her until after she contacted me. Please, you have to believe me!",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Where is Karliah now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't know. When I asked her where she was going, she just muttered ""where the end began"". Here, take the Goldenglow Estate deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more to him alive.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
"I'll keep quiet about your scam, but you owe me.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now you're speaking my language. Tell you what, if you need any stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good money for them. Consider me your new friend in the north.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
I'm keeping the deed. Any objections?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be bringing me nothing but trouble anyway. Karliah didn't even want it, she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Why did Karliah purchase Goldenglow Estate?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me. But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the Thieves Guild where it hurts.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
How would that hurt the guild?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb. If the owner cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the picture...which she can't afford. If I was Maven, I'd blame the Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
Which makes Maven lose faith in us.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support. This Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this. Now, you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?",CHARACTER,Gulum-Ei,male
The player returns to the Guild.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"He said Goldenglow was purchased by a ""Karliah"".",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, it...it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades. This is grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with again.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Gulum-Ei also told me she was a murderer.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Karliah destroyed everything this guild stood for. She murdered my predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild. After we discovered what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just vanished.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Why has she returned?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We watched each other's backs. I know her techniques, her skills. If she kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her. If only we knew where she was...",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Gulum-Ei told me she said, ""Where the end began.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered Gallus...a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum. We have to go out there before she disappears again.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
We?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her. Here's your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
The player goes to Snow Veil Sanctum in Winterhold.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Good, you're finally here. I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain Karliah is still inside.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
You saw her?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it...she won't be using it to escape. Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside while she's distracted. Take the lead.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
You want me to lead?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge. You're leading and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Understood.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a blade. The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning her that we're here.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
How did Gallus die?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Twenty-five years ago, I was standing outside these very same ruins. Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why. When I arrived, Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound, an arrow pierced his throat. Before I could even draw my blade, her second arrow found its mark in my chest.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
So Karliah took on both of you alone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element of surprise. I was lucky...she missed my heart by mere inches. I staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
And Gallus?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into an opening atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man. To this day, I've regretted letting her escape, even if it had meant I died trying. I owed Gallus that much.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
What happened after Gallus died?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to claim Gallus' former position as Guild Master. Sides quickly formed behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
And you were a part of this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was gone. Fortunately, I perservered and the other groups were either killed or they left Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
And what of Karliah?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The in-fighting had taken months to subside, which gave her time to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks. I spent thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but it was as if she had simply vanished...like I said before, she was the best.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Tell me about Karliah.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
She was a stubborn Dunmer...always had to do everything her way. But she was also the best...bringing in more coin a month than some thieves heist in a year. Gallus trusted her too much and let her get too close.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"So, they had a relationship.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him for the kill. Gallus would call her his ""little nightingale"". He was absolutely smitten by her.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Why did she kill him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an iniquitous act. One thing's certain: I intend to find out before she draws her last breath.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Isn't murder Dark Brotherhood territory?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves. We both agree it's best to keep these matters in-house. Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
They arrive at the ruins' locked entrance.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes impenetrable. This one doesn't look too difficult. Quite simple, really. I don't know what all the fuss is about these locks. All it takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill. That should do it. After you.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
The two head inside.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The stench in here...this place smells of death. Be on your guard. Pull the chain over there and watch out for the spikes. Looks like Karliah reset all the traps.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
They fight off boatloads of awakened draugr.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Karliah always was a nimble minx...slipping past these draugr must be child's play for her. We're on the right track. She's been through here as well.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"After more fighting, a long passage is revealed.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
That door up ahead...looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
They come to a door requiring a specific claw object.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint. Without the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm sure Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own. Fortunately, these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite simple, really.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
He opens the door easily.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"As they enter the next room, the player is dropped to the floor by a hidden Mercer and Karliah play out.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Give me a reason to try.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"""To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies."" It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
You always were a quick study.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
Did you forget the oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Enough of this mindless banter! Come, Karliah! It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Instead, she drinks an invisibility potion.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence. But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
She slips away. Mercer goes and stands over the player.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself. Karliah has provided me the means to be rid of you, and this ancient tomb becomes your final resting place. But do you know what intrigues me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you. Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"He stabs the player, walking away as they bleed out. Later, the player wakes up in front of the Sanctum. Karliah is there.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly. How are you feeling?",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Hold on...you shot me!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out. Had I intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Why save me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had a clear shot. I made a split-second decision to get you out of the way and it prevented your death.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Then I'm in your debt.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
More than you'll ever realize.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Why should I believe you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue. I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
You should have shot Mercer instead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I promise you, the thought crossed my mind. The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough for a single shot. All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Why capture Mercer alive?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done. He needs to pay for Gallus' murder.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
How will you prove it now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply for irony's sake. Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal from Gallus' remains. I suspect the information we need is written inside.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Well, what's it say?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've never seen before.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Perhaps it could be translated.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Enthir...Gallus' friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course... It's the only outside Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his Nightingale identity.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"There's that word again, ""Nightingale"".",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There were three of us: Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were an anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften. Perhaps I'll tell you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold with the journal and get the translation. Here, take these as well, they may prove useful for your journey.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Can't you come with me to Winterhold?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus' remains to lay to rest. I promise to join you there as soon as I can.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Tell me about Gallus.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone respected him and followed him without question. It was Gallus who inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a razor-sharp point. I owe everything to him. We were...very close.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
You were lovers?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what happened to him.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Why didn't you kill Mercer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name across his network of contacts. For twenty-five years I ran, never sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks. Mercer doesn't need to die...he needs to feel the cold sting of fate as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Might not have a choice next time.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I won't hesitate. Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Enthir is found at Winterhold's inn.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Yes, yes, what is it?",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
I've been sent by Karliah.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Karliah? Then she's finally found it. Do you have Gallus' journal?,CHARACTER,Enthir,male
"Yes, but there's a problem.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A problem? Let me see it. This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but always too clever for his own good. He's written all of the text in the Falmer language.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
Can you translate it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. However, I know someone who might. The court wizard of Markarth, Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal translated. A word of warning: Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his research. Getting the information won't be easy.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
What exactly is a Falmer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
So they were like your kind?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly rivaled our own.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
What drove them underground?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland. The Falmer retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the dwarves, who ended up betraying them. This betrayal made them what they are now...horrible, blind monstrosities with a burning hatred of any but their own kind.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
They sound more like victims to me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
You appear to despise them.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of my acquaintances. They're animals...they show absolutely no pity or remorse.,CHARACTER,Enthir,male
Then I'll make it a point to hunt them down.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish to see them avenged. If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on the subject. Should be on my table.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
What can you tell me about Gallus?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of academia...I was devastated when he was killed. I suppose that risk always coexisted with his line of work; I just never thought his luck would run out.,CHARACTER,Enthir,male
He was an academic yet he chose a different path. Why?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, for the thrill, of course. He was quite clear that he felt more in his element climbing through a window than hunched over a dusty tome.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
How did you meet him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to break into my laboratory. I was about to show him the error of his ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research notes. I was astounded and it in turn lead to a conversation. Who'd have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
Why did Gallus scribe his journal in Falmer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel that even recognize the language? I'm fairly certain he was planning some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer language. Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the details.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
Where did he acquire the knowledge to use it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you, to Markarth and Calcelmo. I'm only hoping whatever means he used to learn the language will still be available to you. Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
The player finds Markath's court wizard.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important. What are you doing here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or guards.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
"I was looking for you, actually.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always bother me when I'm trying to finish my research? You idiot. Do you even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me! I...I'm sorry, I...I got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very...stressful work, and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
I hear you're the authority on ancient Falmer.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of completing my magnum opus on the subject. I'm calling it ""Calcelmo's Guide to the Falmer Tongue"". It will revolutionize the way we understand those ancient beings.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
Perhaps I could view your work?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim! You must be mad to think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.,CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
Even after everything I did for you and Faleen?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in improving my affairs of the heart. If you wish, you may enter my tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories are still off-limits. That's the best I can offer.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
But I'm a great admirer of your work. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline. Being an admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research a secret.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
What will it cost to change your mind? (Bribe),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with, but I can assure you personal wealth is our lowest priority.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
Grant me access or you'll regret it. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Do you realize that at the snap of my finger, I can bring the entire Markarth city guard to my defense? You best rethink this course of action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
Forget it. Maybe I'll come back later.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more comfortable discussing my findings with you.",CHARACTER,Calcelmo,male
"The Dragonborn enters the museum, then slips into the laboratories. He can overhear Aicantar, Calcelmo's nephew, in the distance.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You heard me, captain -- our work must not be disturbed. Kill any intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one through.",CHARACTER,Aicantar,male
"...As you say, sir.",CHARACTER,Wizards' Guard,male
"After some slipping through the guard detail, the player sneaks into the coming in.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Yes, I'm positive I heard something!",CHARACTER,Aicantar,male
"I...oh, alright. If there is a thief, he won't leave this tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?",CHARACTER,Aquilius,male
I'll deal with my uncle. Just...go! Scour this place from top to bottom!,CHARACTER,Aicantar,male
The Dragonborn escapes and returns to Enthir in Winterhold. Karliah's there.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
This should help translate Gallus' journal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this, so I simply won't. A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
It's quite the tale.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I undertstand. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here, please. Hmm... This is intriguing, but highly disturbing. It appears Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months. Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an ""...unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.""",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
Does the journal say where this wealth came from?,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.,CHARACTER,Enthir,male
"Anything else, Enthir? Anything about...the Nightingales?",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Hmm. Yes, here it is. The last few pages seem to describe ""the failure of the Nightingales,"" although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
Shadows preserve us. So it's true...,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?,CHARACTER,Enthir,male
"I'm sorry, Enthir. I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately. Farewell, Enthir...words can't express...",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"It's alright, Karliah. You don't have to say a word. Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and she deserves better. Do whatever you can and I'll consider it a personal favor.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
"Thank you, Enthir.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me. I've been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time and I'll see what I can do.",CHARACTER,Enthir,male
You must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the Guild.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Gallus' journal mentioned the ""Twilight Sepulcher"".",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer. The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the Nightingales are sworn to protect at all costs.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Why does it require that type of protection?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within the walls of the Sepulcher. Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Thieves and temples. It just doesn't add up.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me. I think given time, you'll understand what I mean.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I'd understand better if less mystery was involved.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher. I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to have to ask that you continue to trust me.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Very well, we do it your way for now.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon. In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but given the circumstances I think he'd approve.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I'll put it to good use.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
He takes Gallus' Nightingale Blade and makes for the Flagon.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Karliah waits at the Flagon's entrance, far away from the sitting area.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to suspect who I am. Are you ready to face the Guild?,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I'm ready. Let's go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the cistern.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What if Mercer's there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then we'll show them Gallus' journal and hope for the best. Remember, we've got proof and all he's got is his word.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"No, I'm not.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Time is of the essence here, please hurry back.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
A thief is waiting behind the false cabinet.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.,CHARACTER,Garthar,male
"The cistern is filled with the guildmembers, all readying their sword arms.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all bee misled!",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"No tricks, Karliah, or I'll cut you down where you stand. Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I have Gallus' journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Let me see. No, it...it can't be. This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn. What's in that book? What did it say?",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
How could Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible. Could he pick his way in?,CHARACTER,Delvin,male
That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.,CHARACTER,Vex,female
He didn't need to pick the lock.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What's she on about?,CHARACTER,Delvin,male
"Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Delvin fulfills his role.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours.",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
Brynjolf uses his. The vault's contents are laid bare.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"The gold, the jewels...it's all gone.",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
That son of a bitch! I'll kill him!,CHARACTER,Vex,female
Vex! Put it away...right now. We can't afford to lose our heads...we need to calm down and focus.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Do what he says, Vex. This ain't helpin' right now.",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
Fine. We do it your way. For now.,CHARACTER,Vex,female
"Delvin, Vex...watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Other guild members can comment on the recent heist or situation. This is optional, but still worth noting somewhere.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.,CHARACTER,Delvin,male
Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.,CHARACTER,Delvin,male
"If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!",CHARACTER,Vex,female
"Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.",CHARACTER,Vex,female
How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that long? Amazing.,CHARACTER,Rune,male
I never saw this coming. I thought we were just having a run of bad luck.,CHARACTER,Cynric,male
Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for bringing Karliah here.,CHARACTER,Ravyn,male
Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.,CHARACTER,Niruin,male
"If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare hands!",CHARACTER,Garthar,male
I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray all of us like that?,CHARACTER,Thrynn,male
I dare Mercer to come back here! He takes one step in the cistern and I'll cut it off!,CHARACTER,Sapphire,female
I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our noses.,CHARACTER,Vipir,male
"There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope you find him before he escapes our grasp. If you find Mercer, give no quarter...kill him and be done with it.",CHARACTER,Tonilia,female
"Word is Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood. I can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before my time, but I still can't believe it. You need to teach him a lesson...show him the penalty for betrayal around here.",CHARACTER,Vekel,male
Back to the mandatory stuff...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Look, before I help you track Mercer down, I need to know what you learned from Karliah. I mean everything.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Mercer killed Gallus, not Karliah.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the Guild. Anything else?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Gallus, Karliah and Mercer were Nightingales.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What? Nightingales? But, I always just assumed they were a tale... a way to keep the young footpads in line. Was there anything else she told you?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Karliah was behind Goldenglow and Honningbrew.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass. Was there anything else?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"No, that's it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then, I have an important task for you. I need you to break into Mercer's home and search for anything that tells us where he could have gone.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
He has a house in Riften?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, a gift from the Black-Briars when the kicked the previous family out...place called Riftweald Manor. He never stays there, just pays for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard the place.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I'll take care of it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to send you. Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you have permission to kill anyone who stands in your way.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What's the best way to get into Riftweald Manor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and that was in Mercer's company. If you can get past his trained watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second floor balcony in his backyard.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I don't suppose the ramp is easy to access.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No. It's some sort of crazy contraption commissioned for quick escapes. I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would lower it in a hurry.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What's missing from the vault?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Better question would be ""what did he leave."" Mercer took everything. Even all of our plans are gone.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Plans for what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of material on locations the Guild could heist. Museums, keeps, estates...you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we must have had a few dozen.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
How could he have opened the vault door alone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable. Without two keys, it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
You mentioned a watchdog?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one. Mercer's holding something over his head, keeping him loyal. Talk to Vex. She used to know him very well...if you catch my meaning. Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that madman.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
If the player speaks to Vex on the matter...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Brynjolf said you have info on Vald.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.",CHARACTER,Vex,female
I want to get on his good side.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person. The only thing Vald understands is gold. A man after my own heart.,CHARACTER,Vex,female
"So, buy him off?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray Mercer Frey. Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the details. Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need off his corpse...I could care less. While you're in there, help yourself to anything in Frey's manor. I would.",CHARACTER,Vex,female
If the player speaks to Vald:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.,CHARACTER,Vald,male
I need to get inside Mercer's house.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No visitors. No way. Now piss off before ya make me mad.,CHARACTER,Vald,male
Mercer needs you in Markarth right away! (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, come on, I ain't that dumb.",CHARACTER,Vald,male
I'll make it worth your while. (Bribe),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away, unless ya can talk to Maven Black-Briar into lettin' me outta my debt. You try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.",CHARACTER,Vald,male
Let me in or I'll kill you. (Intimidate),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hahaha! That's funny. Ya think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've been itching for a fight.,CHARACTER,Vald,male
If one then speaks to Maven:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'd like to erase Vald's debt.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot? He owes me a steep debt. In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
What did he do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of mine in Winterhold. Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
He's in debt because of a quill?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The wizards call it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous amount of gold to have it made. If you can locate the quill and return it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider the debt satisfied.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
What is the Quill of Gemination?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing in exacting detail. I'm sure you understand how useful that would prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were involved.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
What if someone else got their hands on it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known only to myself. So if you're getting any ideas abou selling it to someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
How did it end up in Lake Honrich?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the lake so he could avoid the roads. The idiot got lost in the mist and ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom. He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to find it in the past has been unsuccessful.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
Any ideas where I can look?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks...I'd check under the water near one of the small islands in the lake. Perhaps you should start at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate. I believe we're done.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
If the player recovers the Quill:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I found the Quill of Gemination.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Really? I wrote that off a long time ago. Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain. Give this document to Vald. It frees him from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.",CHARACTER,Maven,female
If the player brings the note to Vald:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have something of yours.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of mine? What is it?,CHARACTER,Vald,male
"Here, it's your debt with Maven. You're free.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can't believe it! How'd ya talk her into this? Never mind, I don't care. I'm just glad I don't gotta work for Maven anymore. Here, ya did me a favor, I guess I owe you one.",CHARACTER,Vald,male
"He gives over the key and walks off. Either way, the player will enter the Brynjolf...",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left. No sign of Mercer. Any luck on your end?,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"He wasn't here, but I found these plans.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was Gallus's pet project. If he gets his hands on them, you can be certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Then we have to stop him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after one of the last greatest heists is just an insult. I've spoken to Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she wishes to speak with both of us. Quickly, we have no time to lose.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Karliah walks over.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Aye, lass...and I've come to a decision. Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Then it's all true...everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Yes. That is why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing. Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate, is a small path cut up the mountainside. At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both to meet me there.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"The player goes to the designated location, a dead end where the path has vanished. A gigantic stone is off to one side. The other two are waiting.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm glad you're here.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What's the significance of this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind. We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What kind of an edge?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Tell me about the Nightingales.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what is known as the Nightingale Trinity. The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Were they a part of the Thieves Guild?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the Guild, although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What is their purpose?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Nightingales protect the Temple of Nocturnal, a place known as the Twilight Sepulcher.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Who is Nocturnal?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every thief in Tamriel.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I've never met a thief that worshipped anything.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests and no sermons, no services and no alms. She influences our luck and in return demands payment.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Sounds like a Guild contract.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're closer to understanding than you realize. The only difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense, and sometimes the cost can be quite high. Whether you know it or not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"I have my skill, not powers or magic.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how our luck behaves? Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his pocket? It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences us.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Sounds like she just likes us to suffer.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have been volumes written on the subject. Does she exact payment when we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one knows. The return certainly seems worth the risk though.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Am I to become a Nightingale?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's my hope that you will, yes.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What happened to capturing Mercer alive?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil Sanctum, my path changed its course. Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put Gallus's remains to rest. I'd always intended Mercer's fate to ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken. This way, please.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"A rock slides back in the cliffs, revealing the hidden Nightingale Hall.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose. It helped avert attention from our true nature. What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"This isn't about religion, Brynjolf...it's business. This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century. Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Each goes to one of the emblem-emblazoned stones and receives armor.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You appear ready for the Oath.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Okay, lass. We've got these getups on...now what?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Beyond this gate is the first step to becoming a Nightingale.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Whoa there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs. If she is to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish. And in return, both in life and death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose. If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Yes, I'm ready.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I'm not sure I understand the terms.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a business deal. You'll be provided all the power and knowledge befitting a Nightingale. You're free to use those powers as you see fit, to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
And in return?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and everything within when the need arises. More importantly, upon your death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one of its guardians.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
There's no going back?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding. Knowing this, are you ready to undergo the ceremony?",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"In the deepest chamber, each person stands on a floor glyph.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I call upon you, Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow. Hear my voice!",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Nocturnal manifests as a giant ball of energy.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something, did we?",CHARACTER,Nocturnal,female
"My lady, I come before you to throw myself at your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?",CHARACTER,Nocturnal,female
I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.",CHARACTER,Nocturnal,female
"My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Revenge? How interesting... Very well, your conditions are acceptable. You may proceed.",CHARACTER,Nocturnal,female
"Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels. We will honor our agreement in this life and in the next until your conditions have been met.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah. And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again.",CHARACTER,Nocturnal,female
"All three people glow with blue energy, then Nocturnal disappears.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
He's done more?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Mercer was unable to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher...the Skeleton Key. By doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal, and in essence, caused our luck to run dry.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
So the key unlocks any door?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, yes. But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers. All of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield greater power, securely sealed within our minds. Once you realize the key can access these traits, the potential becomes limitless.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The Guild should possess this item.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Although it would benefit the Guild more than you could imagine, in the end, it would do more harm than good.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The three of us could keep it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm afraid that's impossible.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Sounds like no one should possess it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good, then you understand why this is about more than Mercer's lust for power. If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher, things will never be the same for the Guild. As time passed on, our luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
First time I ever set out to return something...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return a stolen item to its rightful owner.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Let's go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you listen to him.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle before we go after Mercer...the leadership of the Guild.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Why tell this to me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here. Thanks to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full strength. As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Me? What about you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder. I'm good at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know. I've never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't want it.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I don't know what to say.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so don't get sentimental on me now.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
It's about time you asked.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild. Just don't lose yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"No, it's not right.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true. And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He lacked the loyalty you obviously possess. I can't think of anyone better.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I accept.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure me we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details. Until then, we have quite the task ahead.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Then lets get to it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand. Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will be a fight to remember!",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Do you think we stand a chance against Mercer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now I think our chances have improved. Look, call me crazy if you like, but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal path. Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercers blood on my blade than spend my life regretting that I ran the other way.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
I guess we're Nightingales now.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense. Mercer may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny. Old Delvin kept calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's on us.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"If one talks to Karliah, 2 new options comes up.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I don't feel stronger.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from Nocturnal's gifts.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
But she spoke to us.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with Nocturnal. In order for us to receive our abilities...our end of the bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Then Nocturnal's angry at us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me...with any of us, she wouldn't have answered my call. I have no doubt that we still hold her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat Mercer Frey.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
May I ever return to Nightingale Hall?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your new home. You'll find that this place offers many things that will help you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to learn. Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The player reunites with the Nightingales in Irkngthand's Grand Cavern area.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Mercer's been here...I hope we're not too late.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Those bandits back there...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing. We have to catch up to him before it's too late.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I'm ready. Let's go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind a few surprises for us.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The player can have optional convos with the other 'Gales at this point.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Do you think Mercer knows we're here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us... leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down. I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we Nightingales need to stick together, eh?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
What are the Eyes of the Falmer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities. The thief had broken into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
A snow elf?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago...before they became the blind monstrositie they are today. When Gallus took one look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold. Didn't take long for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
So the Eyes of the Falmer are gems?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth? Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well. There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans were shelved and the rest is history.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Do you think Mercer knows we're here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those plans behind unless he had his reasons. For someone in possession of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's play. No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Both of you wait here a moment.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Alright, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to come find you.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Let's go.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Lead on, we're ready. Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer are blind but they can still hear us.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"A ways ahead, through a massive barricade, they spy something creeping behind Falmer, killing them. It soon runs out of sight.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Wait a moment...what's that? It's Mercer! Look...down there!,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"I'm on it, lass. Damn it! There's no way through.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Aye, lass...and we'll be ready for him. Let's keep moving.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
They continue a tour of the massive caverns.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The Nightingales find a debris-strewn room.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this chamber. Your choice.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
They reach the other side after hearing a rumbling.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer. We'll have to find another way around.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
They find a chamber with Falmer and a large dwarven construct.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Shor' bones! Look at that monstrosity.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're right behind you.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Further on...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Everyone heads into the next section, killing more Falmer by torture devices.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
In the next cavern:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down...I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
In the shoddy tunnel beyond:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a lake.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
At the final door...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"They all enter the deepest chamber, where Mercer is trying to pry the gemmed eyes out of a massive Falmer statue.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Climb down that ledge and see if you can--,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"He activates something, crumbling the ledge they're standing on.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"When Brynjolf brought you before me, I could feel a sudden shift in the wind. And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at the end of a blade.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Give me the Key, Mercer.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises? Nocturnal doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the Guild.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
I don't believe you. Nocturnal guides me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence...they blind your wisdom as well. Our actions have always been one and the same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
It's not about Nocturnal. This is personal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us? When will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from yours? Both of us life, cheat and steal to further our own end.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
To blazes with Nocturnal. I'm here for the Eyes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Wait a moment...do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble thief? Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature is no different than my own.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
The difference is I still have honor.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do...as an instrument of limitless wealth. Instead you've chosen to fall over your own foolish code.,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"If anyone falls, it will be you.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale blood! Karliah, I'll deal with you after I deal with your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.",CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"Mercer uses his powers to control Brynjolf, making him fight Karliah. They both start parrying each others attacks.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What...what's happening... I can't stop myself.,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Fight it, Brynjolf...he's taken control of you!",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"I'm sorry, lass, I...I can't...!",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Damn you, Mercer!",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Enough of this! Fight me!,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"The player is left to fight Mercer alone, eventually dealing a coup de grace.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Shadows take me...,CHARACTER,Mercer,male
"With his spell over, the other Nightingales quit fighting and try the door.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"The water rapidly rises. At the last moment, part of the ceiling collapses, take a breather in Bronze Water Cave",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I can't believe it's over. After twenty-five years in exile and just like that, it's done. All that remains is to ensure the safe return of the Skeleton Key.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Sounds like it will be a simple task.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm afraid it's not that simple. When the Skeleton Key was stolen from the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed. The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I take it you never used the Pilgrim's Path.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways. As a consequence, I have no knowledge of what you'll be facing.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Then we'd best get started.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while you're away. And I...I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure to protect the Key. I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Don't worry. I'll return the Key.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you. I've had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I hope it brings you the same luck.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I don't understand why you won't come with me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've been a Nightingale for a very long time. I sold my allegiance to Nocturnal in exchange for many profitable years of thieving. Falling in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life. Until the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What's the story with the Pilgrim's Path?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests. Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor. As part of their ""duties,"" the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies, all on Nocturnal's behalf.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
This didn't interfere with the Nightingales?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"These priests weren't threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated. One of the ceremonies involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so-called ""test of worthiness"". If a pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said they would live forever in twilight. What that means is anyone's guess.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Tell me about the conduit inside the Sepulcher.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been in Skyrim...well, longer than recorded history. The Twilight Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield it from those who would exploit its power. It's through this conduit that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains in return is a complete mystery.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"The player journeys to the Sepulcher, tucked away in a corner of Falkreath. A single ghostly sentinel guards the temple steps.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I didn't recognize you, but I sense you are one of us. Who are you?",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
I'd ask the same question of you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
The last? What happened to the rest?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for what's happened here.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
How are you to blame?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship. Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Wait a moment... You're Gallus!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I haven't heard that name in a long time. How do you know of me?,CHARACTER,Gallus,male
I have the Key.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again. And Mercer Frey?,CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then...it's over and my death wasn't in vain. I owe you a great deal, Nightingale.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
I did this for Nocturnal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our...well, in your line of work.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
I did this to honor the Guild.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it, I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
I did this to get rich.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've done. My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Karliah helped me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Karliah...she's still alive? I feared she'd befallen the same fate, ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Then take the Key and right all the wrongs.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm afraid it's impossible. From the moment I arrived here, I've felt myself...well...dying.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
How can a spirit die?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within these walls is the Ebonmere...a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of Evergloam. When Mercer stole the key, that conduit closed, severely limiting our ties to her.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Then I'll have to proceed alone.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The years without restoration of my power have taken their toll. Whatever damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
How does the Ebonmere affect all of us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Luck is meaningless. What we do involves skill.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own...don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise. But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
How's that changing the way things are?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Think about the Guild...about the state it was in when you began. Think about all the little things you might have heard. A pick breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky clearing at the wrong moment... Our access to those bits of luck are what separates us from common bandits.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
"So with the Ebonmere closed, our luck's run dry?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Precisely. There are still a few who call Nocturnal ""Lady Luck"" and for good reason.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
What will I face in the Pilgrim's Path?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber for the last quarter century. The only possible help I've come across are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
What's wrong with the other Nightingale Sentinels?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"With the Ebonmere closed, and the sudden severance from the realm of Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change. They're shadows of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or their original identities.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Why aren't you like them?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed. However, ever since that day, I've felt my power waning...slowly draining away.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Can't you just take the Key?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect me too. As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself slipping away. Even right this moment, I feel strange...when I don't think I should be feeling anything at all. Good luck, Nightingale.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
"The player proceeds down the Pilgrim's Path, eventually ending up in a pit. opens it, summoning Nocturnal to the realm.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"My, my. What do we have here? It's been a number of years since I've stepped foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends to lose track. So...once again the Key has been stolen and a ""champion"" returns it to the Sepulcher. Now that Ebonmere has been restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on the head...a kiss on your cheek. What you fail to realize is your actions were expected and represent nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement. Don't mistake my tone for displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to the letter. But we both know this has little to do with honor and oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize. Fear not. You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for wealth. I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born. The Oath has been struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the Evergloam. Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time, won't you?",CHARACTER,Nocturnal,female
Nocturnal disappears. The player goes over to Karliah.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely. Nocturnal seemed quite pleased with your efforts.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Pleased? She sounded indifferent.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way. Think of her as a scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful; outwardly sounding angry but silently content. I assure you, had she been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
What's thi about becoming an Agent of Nocturnal?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers befitting a Nightingale Agent. The crescent moon represents the Agent of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon for the Agent of Strife.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Why can't I be all three?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance. If you ever feel the need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and step onto a different circle. Be warned that once you've chosen, you can't reselect for at least a day.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
So what now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
And you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in my life has finally been filled. I only hope this isn't an ending to things, but actually the beginning.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The beginning of what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known. There are pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe for the picking. We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still thieves and we're damn good at what we do.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Tell me about the Agent of Stealth.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage. On moonlit nights or in darkneed rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Tell me about the Agent of Strife.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into the heart of another, causing great injury to them. At the same time, this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him stronger.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Tell me about the Agent of Subterfuge.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgment of those around him. By weaving the darkness to their will, this Agent can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited time. Choose your path and your journey will be complete.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"The player picks a power. At that moment, Gallus returns to the Ebonmere.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Karliah?,CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Gallus! I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd become like the others.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would have come true. He honors us all.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
"What will you do now, my love?",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.,CHARACTER,Gallus,male
Will I ever see you again?,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
"Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open...walk with the shadows.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Goodbye, Karliah.",CHARACTER,Gallus,male
"Optionally, the player can ask more questions of Karliah now.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How will I know if I'm needed here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call. Should the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall. Use it whenever you wish.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Where will you be from now on?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there. Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities to ""acquire"" things from time to time. Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
Where did Gallus go?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Gallus's oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms. Now his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam...the realm of perpetual twilight and the cradle of shadow.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"So, he's gone?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No, not gone...he's become one with the shadows. This is the greatest honor a Nightingale can hope to achieve. In death, he's become part of that which we use to live.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
They're a part of the darkness around us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Absolutely. When we say ""walk with the shadows,"" we are asking those Nightingales who have passed on to protect us. It's believed that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck...by placing their hands in ours. That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
The player returns to the Guild.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"It's good to see you in one piece, lad! I just wanted to give you a proper thank you for everything you've done. The Guild is back on its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future. What's become of the Skeleton Key?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
It's been returned to the Sepulcher.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's it then. After all of those years helplessly watching the Guild decline. But enough of that...I'm confident that with you in charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"So, where will you be now?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing...and no one skims! If you still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more than their fair share to give out. Either way, it's been a pleasure, my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another thousand years!",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"After the speech, if the Guild is reestablished in all major cities, one is directed to talk to Bryn about becoming the outfit's new leader.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well, my friend...the time's come to make it official. It's time to become our Guild Master. Don't worry, I promise this will be short and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room, we can begin.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Karliah, Delvin, Vex and the others gather round for the ""coronation"".",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short. Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order. With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours. Delvin?",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Agreed.,CHARACTER,Delvin,male
Vex?,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"Sure, why not...",CHARACTER,Vex,female
Karliah?,CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
Absolutely.,CHARACTER,Karliah,female
"Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life. Now everyone, get back to work.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
This officially ends the questline. Most guildies will remark on the player's given a line relating to it afterwards.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You need anything, anything at all...don't hesitate to ask.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!",CHARACTER,Delvin,male
I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer anyway.,CHARACTER,Vex,female
"I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.,CHARACTER,Maven,female
Here's to a long and prosperous future...may the Guild last another hundred years.,CHARACTER,Tonilia,female
I am at your service.,CHARACTER,Vipir,male
"As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you.",CHARACTER,Cynric,male
"So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!",CHARACTER,Thrynn,male
"Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.",CHARACTER,Sapphire,female
We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!,CHARACTER,Niruin,male
Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.,CHARACTER,Garthar,male
I promise to live up to your expectations.,CHARACTER,Ravyn,male
"I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up. Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content as things keep going our way. A new chapter in the Thieves Guild is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.",CHARACTER,Vekel,male
If the player asks Karliah about her new dialogue options...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
About the secrecy of the Nightingales...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves. The notion that the Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed. If you wish to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no one would give it a second thought.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
How have things been now that Mercer's gone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm feeling a sense of inner peace...something I haven't felt in a very long time. Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment. Of course, I've been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and feel free to share the fruits of my labor.",CHARACTER,Karliah,female
If the player asks Brynjolf about his new dialogue options...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So that's it? There's nothing else to it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for, but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around. After we're done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild Master Armor. Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this. It's sort of a tradition around here.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
How's the Guild doing?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Take a good look around you! Have you ever seen the Guild in such a prosperous state? With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't seen in decades. I couldn't be more proud to be part of the Thieves Guild, or its new Guild Master.",CHARACTER,Brynjolf,male
"On one's travels, the player finds an orc slaying a vampire.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You there. The Dawnguard is looking for anyone willing to fight against the growing vampire menace. What do you say?,CHARACTER,Durak,male
What's the Dawnguard?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
We're vampire hunters. We search out and destroy those bloodsucking scum wherever we find them.,CHARACTER,Durak,male
I haven't noticed any vampire menace.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're not paying attention then. Like most everyone else around here. Haven't you heard that the Hall of the Vigilants was destroyed by vampires? They never took the threat seriously, and now they've paid the price.",CHARACTER,Durak,male
Vigilants? Dawnguard? What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Vigilants mostly hunt down daedra worshippers, which is why they got torn to pieces when they went up against vampires. That's why our leader Isran is reestablishing the Dawnguard. Real, serious vampire hunters.",CHARACTER,Durak,male
Killing vampires? Where do I sign up?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ha. Isran's going to like you. He's up the hill in the fort. He'll decide if you're Dawnguard material.,CHARACTER,Durak,male
"Sorry, I'm not interested.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's what everybody says, right up until they find their throat being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires. If you change your mind and decide to join fight before it's too late, go talk to Isran up at the fort.",CHARACTER,Durak,male
The player seeks out Fort Dawnguard via a canyon passage east of Riften. A scrawny man is alongside the road nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Oh, hey there! You here to join the Dawnguard, too? Truth is, I'm a little nervous. I've never done anything like this before. I hope you don't mind if I walk up with you. Hey, uh, don't tell Isran I was afraid to meet him by himself. Not the best first impression for a new vampire hunter, I guess. You've probably killed lots of vampires, huh? I'm sure Isran will sign you right up. Not sure he'll take me. I hope so. That must be it. Fort Dawnguard... Wow. Bigger than I expected.",CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
"They come upon a mammoth fortification, bigger than the Palace of the Kings or even Dragonsreach.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Where is everybody? This place looks almost deserted.,CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
They come up to the main gate's steps.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I guess this is it. Wish me luck.,CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
"New recruits? Hmm. Isran will decide if you've got what it takes. Go on, he's right inside.",CHARACTER,Celann,male
They enter the vestibule to find Isran arguing with Vigilant Tolan.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Why are you here, Tolan? The Vigilants and I were finished with each other a long time ago.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
You know why I'm here. The Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The vampires are much more dangerous than we believed.,CHARACTER,Tolan,male
"And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that it? I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Fort Dawnguard is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair. And now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging for my protection?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of the Vigilants...everyone...they're all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?",CHARACTER,Tolan,male
"Yes, well...I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all of you... I am sorry, you know.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
He notices the player's presence.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So who are you? What do you want?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
I'm here to join the Dawnguard.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Got a fire in your belly to kill vampires, eh? Good for you. But look around -- there's really not much to join yet. I've only just started rebuilding the order.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
I heard you were looking for vampire hunters.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You heard right. I'm glad word's finally starting to get around. But that means it won't be long before the vampires start to take notice as well.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
I was just looking around. What is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Why do I even post guards? This is the headquarters of the Dawnguard. Well, it used to be, a long time ago. As you can see, we have some work to do to restore it to its former glory. But maybe you want to help me with that?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
What can I do to help?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I need someone out in the field, taking the fight to the damn vampires, while we're getting the fort back in shape... Tolan was telling me about some cave that the Vigilants were poking around in. Seemed to think it was more related to these recent vampire attacks.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
What's the Dawnguard?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We hunt down and kill vampires. Haven't you been paying attention? In the old days, the Dawnguard kept all of Skyrim safe from those bloodsucking scum. Then people stopped taking the threat seriously, the Dawnguard was disbanded, and the vampires came creeping back. Now I'm trying to reestablish the Dawnguard. Take the fight to the vampires for a change. I hope it isn't too late.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
I'll have to think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"While you're thinking about it, the vampires will be gathering strength in the shadows, waiting to strike.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
The player joins up.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Tolan, tell him about, what was it, Dimhollow?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Yes, that's it. Dimhollow Crypt. Brother Adalvald was sure it held some long-lost vampire artifact of some kind. We didn't listen to him any more than we did Isran. He was at the Hall when it was attacked...",CHARACTER,Tolan,male
"That's good enough for me. Go see what the vampires were looking for in this Dimhollow Crypt. With any luck, they'll still be there. Here, you should take a crossbow. Good for taking out those fiends before they get close. Feel free to poke around the fort and take what you need. There isn't much yet, but you're welcome to anything you can use.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
I'll meet you at Dimhollow. It's the least I can do to avenge my fallen comrades.,CHARACTER,Tolan,male
"Tolan, I don't think that's a good idea. You Vigilants were never trained for...",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"I know what you think of us. You think we're soft, that we're cowards. You think our deaths proved our weakness. Stendarr grant that you do not have to face the same test and be found wanting. I'm going to Dimhollow Crypt. Perhaps I can be of some small assistance to you.",CHARACTER,Tolan,male
He notices Agmaer nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You there, boy. Stop skulking in the shadows and step up here. What's your name?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"I'm, uh...my name is Agmaer, sir.",CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
"Do I look like a ""sir"" to you, boy? I'm not a soldier, and you're not joining the army.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Yes, si...Isran.",CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
"Didn't I tell you to step forward? Hmm... Farm boy, eh? What's your weapon?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Uh, my weapon? I mostly just use my pa's axe, when wolves are attacking the goats or soemthing.",CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
"""My pa's axe,"" Stendarr preserve us. Don't worry, I think we can make a Dawnguard out of you. Here, take this crossbow and let's see how you shoot.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Uh, crossbow? I've never...",CHARACTER,Agmaer,male
"Yes, a crossbow. Best thing for killing vampires. Just take a few shots at those crates over there. Take a deep breath and let it out as you fire. You need to concentrate, boy. Try it again. You'll get the hang of it. That's it.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
They exit the castle.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Isran found something for you to do, eh? I thought he'd like you. Good luck!",CHARACTER,Celann,male
"The player travels to the crypt, cut into the mountain slope near Dawnstar. Inside, one can hear vampires discussing something.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
These Vigilants never know when to give up. I thought we'd taught them enough of a lesson at their hall.,CHARACTER,Vampire (entrance Dimhollow),male
To come in here alone...a fool like all the rest of them.,CHARACTER,Fledgling,female
He fought well enough though. Jeron and Bresoth were no match for him.,CHARACTER,Vampire (entrance Dimhollow),male
Ha. Those two deserved what they got. Their arrogance had become insufferable.,CHARACTER,Fledgling,female
All this talk is making me thirsty. Perhaps another Vigilant will wander in soon.,CHARACTER,Vampire (entrance Dimhollow),male
I wish Lokil would hurry it up. I have half a mind to return to the castle and tell Harkon what a fool he's entrusted this mission to.,CHARACTER,Fledgling,female
And I have half a mind to tell Lokil of your disloyalty.,CHARACTER,Vampire (entrance Dimhollow),male
You wouldn't dare. Now shut up and keep on watch.,CHARACTER,Fledgling,female
"After slaying the fiends, one finds that Tolan, who had arrived first, was watery chamber where a kidnapped Vigilant is being interrogated by Lokil.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'll never tell you anything. My oath to Stendarr is stronger than any suffering you can inflict on me.,CHARACTER,Adalvald,male
"I believe you, Vigilant. And I don't think you even know what you've found here. So go and meet your beloved Stendarr.",CHARACTER,Lokil,male
He cuts down the hostage.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Are you sure that was wise, Lokil? He still might have told us something. We haven't gotten anywhere ourselves with...",CHARACTER,Vampire (with Lokil),female
He knew nothing. He served his purpose by leading us to this place. Now it is up to us to bring Harkon the prize. And we will not return without it. Vingalmo and Orthjolf will make way for me after this.,CHARACTER,Lokil,male
"Yes, of course Lokil. Do not forget who brought you news of the Vigilants' discovery.",CHARACTER,Vampire (with Lokil),female
I never forget who my friends are. Or my enemies.,CHARACTER,Lokil,male
"He soon forgets everything, as the player kills all the evil vampires. Using solved, revealing...a cute girl inside a coffin-like chamber?!",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Unh...where is...who sent you here?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Who were you expecting?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I was expecting someone...like me, at least.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
I was expecting someone from my family. I don't recognize you. Are you one of my father's little acolytes?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Who's your father?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He's a very powerful man. Or he was at one point. I'm surprised another vampire hasn't heard of him.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"No, a group called the ""Dawnguard"" sent me here.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That's not a name I know. And it doesn't sound like a name a group of vampires would choose.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
A man named Isran.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I...I don't know who that is. Is he...like me?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
That's not your concern.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I think it is, actually. Why would someone who isn't...like me...come all the way down here?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"What do you mean, ""like you""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
A...can't you tell just from looking at me? A vampire.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Are you a...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Vampire, yes.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
How did you know I was a vampire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You think I can't tell my own kind? I smelled you almost before my eyes were open.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
You're a vampire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Can't you tell your own kind? I smelled you almost before my eyes were open.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
The Dawnguard would want me to kill you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not fond of vampires, are they? Well look. Kill me, you've killed one vampire. But if people are after me, there's something bigger going on. I can help you find out what that is.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Don't think that'll keep them from turning on you eventually. They'll figure out what you are.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why were you locked away like this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's...complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you. But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my family's home.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Where do you need to go?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
---,CHARACTER,Serana,female
As long as you don't get in my way.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I was going to say the same thing to you. My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would guess they still do. By the way...my name is Serana. Good to meet you.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
One can inquire further about her circumstances.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Any idea how to get out of here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Your guess is as good as mine. This place looks pretty different from when I was locked away.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Is that an Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, it is, and it's mine.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why do you have an Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It's...complicated. I can't really talk about it. I'm sorry.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Is it fragile? Do we need to be careful with it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ha. Nothing can destroy an Elder Scroll. Worry more about protecting your hide, and let me worry about my things.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
How long were you in there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good question. Hard to say. I...I can't really tell. I feel like it was a long time. Who is Skyrim's High King?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
That's actually a matter for debate.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, wonderful. A war of succession. Good to know the world didn't get boring while I was gone. Who are the contenders?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Ulfric Stormcloak is the true High King.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I've...never heard of him. Is he well supported?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Elisif of Solitude will be High Queen.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I don't know that name. You say she's Jarl of Solitude? Who supports her?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"The Empire supports Elisif, but there are many in Skyrim loyal to Ulfric.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Empire? What...what empire?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
The...Empire. From Cyrodiil.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Cyrodiil is the seat of an empire? I must have been gone longer than I thought. Definitely longer than we planned. Please, let's hurry. I need to get home so I can figure out what's happened.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why were you locked away?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'd...rather not get into that with you. If that's all right. I'm sorry, it's not that...it's just that I don't know who I can trust just yet. Let's get to my home, and I'll have a better sense of where we all stand.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Tell me about your home.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's on an island near Solitude. Hopefully we can find a boat to take us there. It's my family home. Not the most welcoming place, but depending on who's around, I'll be safe there.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why wouldn't you be safe there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let's just say that my mother and father had a bit of a falling out. Don't worry, I'm not in any danger or anything like that. It'll just be more unpleasant to run into my father.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Someone you don't want to see?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My father and I don't really get along. Ugh, saying it out loud makes it sound so...common. ""Little girl who doesn't get along with her father."" Read that story a hundred times.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Wait here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll hang back a bit, but you're not leaving me behind. This is too important.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Sorry, I'm not that easy to get rid of. If you want to run ahead, I won't stop you, but I'll be following.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"If you think I'm going to let you have all the fun, you're crazy. I'll let you lead ahead, but I'll be keeping an eye on you.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Come with me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Let's go.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Thought you'd never ask.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Whenever you're ready.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I need to trade some things with you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hands to yourself.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Not going to happen.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Why don't you keep your things, and I'll keep mine.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
I think we should part ways.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I disagree.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
You can't get rid of me that easily.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"And go where? You can't just leave me alone whenever you feel like it. I'm coming with you, like it or not.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Discussion over, it's time to find the exit.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"This feels like the right way. I was starting to worry. Does the air feel...heavy down here? I'm a little woozy, but it might just be from waking up.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
They finally escape the musty cavern.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, it's so good to breathe again! Even in this weather, it's better than the cave.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
If one travels to Fort Dawnguard before doing anything else...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I don't like the feel of this place. I'll wait for you back by the entrance.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
If one talk with Isran before continuing on with Serana...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, any luck? Was Tolan right about the vampires being interested in Dimhollow Crypt?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Yes, the place was crawling with vampires.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. I assume you took care of that little infestation. Did you figure out what they were looking for in there?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
Tolan was right. And he's dead. The vampires killed him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Damn fool. I told him not to go. The Vigilants always had more bravery than sense. Did you at least find out what the vampires were looking for in there?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
It seems they were looking for a woman who was sealed in the crypt.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That doesn't make much sense. Where is this woman? Who is she?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
I don't know who she is. She says she lives in a castle near Solitude.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"(skip to ""Well I don't know..."")",CHARACTER,Isran,male
She didn't want to follow me here. But she wants me to take her home.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Home? Where's that?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
She says she lives in a castle near Solitude.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well I don't know what that means. But we need to find out. She must either have something the vampires want, or be someone important to them.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"I'm pretty sure she's a vampire, actually.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That would fit with the rest of it... I don't like it, but you did right to play along. We need to find out what this is all about. I won't lie -- if this were any other situation, I'd put her down just on the chance she might be a vampire. But this is something different. I'd say do what she wants. Take her home, and see who else is in this castle.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"On the NW coast of Skyrim, they find a small dock. An island castle looms on the northern horizon.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"That's it, out there to the north. We used to keep a boat around here to get there and back.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"With the boat in working order, they row to Castle Volkihar.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
So this is your home?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
This is it. Home sweet...castle.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why didn't you tell me it was so huge?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I didn't want you to think I was one of those...you know, the women who just sit in their castle all day? I don't know. Coming from a place like this, well...it's not really me. I hope you can believe that.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
It's impressive.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It's something all right.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
They approach the locked front gate.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hey, so...before we go in there...",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What is it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I wanted to thank you for getting me this far. But after we get in there, I'm going to go my own way for a while. I think... I know your friends would probably want to kill everything in there. I'm hoping you can show some more control than that. Once we're inside, just keep quiet for a bit. Let me take the lead.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Are you all right?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I think so. And thanks for asking. (repeats ""I wanted to thank..."")",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What is it now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine, don't worry about it. When we get in, you won't have to babysit about me any more.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Lady Serana's back! Open the gate!,CHARACTER,Watchman,male
They enter the vampire clan's keep. A gruesome feast is going on.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How dare you trespass here! Wait...Serana? Is that truly you? I cannot believe my eyes! My lord! Everyone! Serana has returned!,CHARACTER,Vingalmo,male
I guess I'm expected,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I can't believe it.,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
They go down to the dining room.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have the scroll.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the words aloud? Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike. Now tell me, who is this stranger you have brought into our hall?",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"This is my savior, the one who freed me.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"For my daughter's safe return, you have my gratitude. Tell me, what is your name?",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I'm (name). Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
---,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
You first.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Very well. I am Harkon, lord of this court. By now, my daughter will have told you what we are.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
You're vampires.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not just vampires. We are among the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim.,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
You're a reclusive cannibal cult.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not quite, though I can see how an outsider might arrive at that conclusion. No, we are vampires, among the oldest and most powerful in Skyrim.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I don't really care what you are.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Perhaps you should. I count some of the oldest and most powerful vampires in Skyrim among the members of my court. For centuries we lived here, far from the cares of the world. All that ended when my wife betrayed me and stole away that which I valued most.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
Do I get a reward for finding your daughter?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I was about to suggest that very thing. Yes, you most certainly deserve a reward.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
What happens now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded. There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
And if I refuse your gift?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this once, but you will be banished from this hall.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I'm already a vampire. What more can you offer me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You contracted a disease, perhaps, but you are no true vampire. Accept my gift and I promise that you will learn the difference. Refuse me, and I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I'm a werewolf. What will happen if I accept your gift?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I can smell it on you. The power of my blood will purge that filth and make you whole again.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
And if I want to remain a werewolf?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey. Perhaps you still need convincing? Behold the power!",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
He morphs into a demonic-looking vampire.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"This is the power that I offer! Now, make your choice!",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I will accept your gift and become a vampire.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Be still!,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I don't want to become a vampire. I refuse your gift.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So be it! You are prey, like all mortals. I banish you!",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"If the player accepts, Harkon bites the player's neck and is lead to a back room with a blood fountain in it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Awake at last, good. The power is growing within you, and now you must learn to wield it.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I'm ready to learn about my new powers.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"With my guidance you will become a deadly instrument, striking terror into the hearts of mortals wherever you tread. Now, listen to my words and do as I instruct. The true power of the ancient blood is found in the form of the Vampire Lord. Assume the mantle of the Vampire Lord, and we will continue.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
What happened? How did I get here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My blood is potent. At first, the body is overwhelmed by it. After my bite, you collapsed and felt into a slumber. Now your flesh has acclimated to the new blood that courses through your veins. I assure you, no harm was done. In truth, your strength surprises me. Not all mortals can withstand my embrace.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
What is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A shrine to Molag Bal, the mighty Daedra Prince who is father to all our kind. Our power is a blessing from him. It is he who first bestowed the power of the ancient blood upon me.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
You made a pact with Molag Bal?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In an age long forgotten to history, I ruled as a mighty king. My domain was vast, my riches endless and my power infinite. And yet, as my mortal life neared an end, I faced a seemingly invincible enemy -- my own mortality. I pledged myself to Molag Bal, and in his name I sacrificed a thousand innocents. In reward, he gave everlasting life to myself, my wife and my daughter. And so I have defeated mortality itself.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
The player shapeshifts into the Vamp Lord.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"In this form, you can drain the life from your foes with your right hand. With your left hand, you can wield the power of blood magic to raise the dead. You can also call upon the powers of night to turn into a swarm of bats and reappear some distance away. Should you run out of magicka, you can descend to the ground and fight as the beasts do. Do so now and we will continue.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
The player stops floating.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Good. You are weaker while on the ground, because you cannot access the blood magic. However, the night powers are still yours to command, and your claws are still formidable weapons. Over time, your powers will grow in strength and you will find new ways to use your gifts. There is much to learn, but if you master the powers of the Vampire Lord, few enemies will be able to stand against you. There is one last thing you must know. Slaying mortal men with your life drain grants you new night powers and blood magic. I keep a stable of thralls in the castle should you need to feed like the baser vampires to stave off the sun. That is all I have to teach you. If you wish to be reminded of these lessons, you need only ask. I have a task that will test your new powers, but first, do you have any questions?",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I'm ready to carry out this task.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good. Go and speak to Garan Marethi. Tell him it is time. He will understand.,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
What must I know about being a vampire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As a vampire, you will gain new powers, but also a weakness to sunlight. With each passing day that you do not feed, that weakness will become more deadly, but your powers will also become stronger. Feed upon those who are sleeping, and your vulnerability to sunlight will diminish along with your powers.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
Tell me again about being a Vampire Lord.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"When you first transform into a Vampire Lord, you will hover in the air. While you do, you will command the powers of Blood and Night. Descend to the ground, and you can attack with your claws and feed upon your prey to regain your strength. With experience, your powers will grow and you will discover new ways to use them.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"If one refuses Harkon's gift, the come to outside. With nothing left to do, their doorstep.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Look at this. I should have known it was only a matter of time before they found us. It's the price we pay for openly recruiting. We'll have to step up our defenses. I don't suppose you have some good news for me.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
Not exactly.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Damn. Well what do you know?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
"I have news, but I wouldn't call it good.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course. Why did I suppose differently. Fine, tell me what you know.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"The woman was a vampire, and they wanted her back.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And so we delivered her right to them. I should've kept her here until we were certain...,CHARACTER,Isran,male
The vampires were looking for a woman trapped in Dimhollow.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A woman? Trapped in there? That doesn't make any sense. Who is she? More importantly, where is she?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"She wanted to go home, so I took her to her castle.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I'm waiting to hear what any of this means.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
She's the daughter of a powerful vampire lord.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And so you delivered her to them.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
They also have an Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
They what? And you didn't stop them? You didn't secure the scroll?,CHARACTER,Isran,male
I'm lucky I made it out alive.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Right. So they have this woman, and an Elder Scroll.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"There were too many of them, and only one of me.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So they have everything they wanted, and we're left with nothing.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
I never got the chance.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I suppose you're lucky you're not dead. Or worse, one of them. By the Divines, this couldn't get much worse. This is more than you and I can handle.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
So you're just going to give up?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
When did I say that? We just need...we need help.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
We have to do something.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well of course we do. I'm old, not stupid. We're just going to need some help. If they're bold enough to attack us here, then this may be bigger than I thought. I have good men here, but... There are people I've met and worked with over the years. We need their skill, their talents, if we're going to survive this. If you can find them, we might have a chance.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
Where can I find the people we need?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Right to the point, aren't you. I like that. Not like those fools in the order. We should keep it small. Too many people, and we'll draw unwanted attention to ourselves. I think we'll want Sorine Jurard. Breton girl, whip-smart and good with tinkering. Fascination with the Dwemer. Weapons in particular. Last I knew, she was out in the Reach, convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
She'll help us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Might need a little convincing first, but she should. You'll also want to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I do. Got into his head years back that his experience with animals would help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear. Last I knew he was out scouring Skyrim for more beasts to tame. Bring the two of them back here, and we can get started on coming up with a plan. Watch your back.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Gunmar is located near Ivarstead, tracking his prey.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• You there, hold fast! I've tracked this damned bear for two weeks; I'll not let it have any more victims. • For two weeks I've tracked that bear, and now find that you've killed it on your own. I'm not sure whether that makes you brave or foolish. What brings you here?",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
Isran needs your help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Isran? Needing someone else's help? Never thought I'd hear that. I'm afraid he's a few years too late. I've moved on. I have more important business to attend to. Besides, he can handle anything alone! He assured me so himself. What could he possibly need my help with?",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
We're up against vampires.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Vampires? That...well, that might change things. Tell me more about what's going on.",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
"We're not sure, but they have an Elder Scroll.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By the Eight... • All right, look. I'll consider it, but I just can't leave this bear to prey on more innocent people. Once it's dealt with, then perhaps I'll see what Isran expects of me. • All right. I'll hear out Isran, see if there's anything I can do to help. Where do you expect me to go? Dragonborn: Isran's at Fort Dawnguard. He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in. His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been up to all this time. I'll meet you there.",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
They slay the bear.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Don't know how well I'd have managed by myself. You have my thanks. You've helped me, so I suppose the least I can do is find out what Isran wants. He's still at that fort near Stendarr's Beacon, I assume?",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
"Yes, he said to meet him at Fort Dawnguard.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course he did.,CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
How did you know?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If Isran is anything, he's stubborn. He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in. His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been up to all this time. I'll meet you there.",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
Sorine Jurard is found in the Reach's wilderness.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You haven't seen a sack of dwarven gyros lying around, have you? I'd swear I left it right here. Do you think mudcrabs might've taken it? I saw one the other day... Wouldn't be surprised if it followed me here. Just look around, will you?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
Isran asked me to find you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Isran? Wants me? No, you must be mistaken. He made it exceedingly clear the last time we spoke that he had no interest in my help. I find it hard to believe he changed his mind. He said some very hurtful things to me before I left. Anyway, I'm quite happy with my current pursuits. So if you'll excuse me...",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
You had a falling out?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, that was my point. I felt it was rather clear. Look, what is it you want from me?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
Vampires threaten all of Skyrim. We need your help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Vampires? Really? Oh, and I suppose now he remembers that I proposed no less than three different scenarios that involved vampires overrunning the population. Well, what are they up to?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
They have an Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I... Well, that's actually something I never would've anticipated. Interesting. I'm not sure what they would want with one, but in this case Isran is probably correct in thinking it isn't good.",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
"We're not sure, but Isran is concerned.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In case you haven't noticed, Isran is always concerned about something. That's what got us working together in the first place. Still, if he sent you to find me, it may actually be pretty bad. All right. If nothing else, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to learn more about what's going on so I can better defend myself. But I'm not just going to abandon what I've been working on here. It's too useful. I need at least one intact dwarven gyro. So either I need to find the satchel those mudcrabs stole, or I need another gyro from someplace. You wouldn't happen to have one, would you?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
There's no time. You need to get moving now. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine, fine! I can't afford to forget about this work, though. Some very interesting applications. Now where is it I'm supposed to be going?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
"I'm sorry, but I'm not about to do that without at least a single gyro to show for my efforts.",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
"Here, I've got a dwarven gyro. Take it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Thank you! It's not much, but this will help a great deal with some things I've been researching. Now where is it I'm supposed to be going?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
I don't have any gyros on me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well then I'm very sorry, but I just can't walk away from this project yet.",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
We're meeting at Fort Dawnguard.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah. Been working more on his secret hideout, has he? It'll be interesting to see how much progress he's made. I'll finish up here and head in that direction soon as I can. See you there.",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
"With the two helpers recruited, it's time to report to Isran. The player them to stand in the main entry.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?",CHARACTER,Gunmar,male
Hold it right there.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
A bright light erupts from the center.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What are you doing?,CHARACTER,Sorine,female
Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
He shuts the magical light off.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard. I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way, it's going to be us.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what they're doing? What do we do now?",CHARACTER,Sorine,female
"We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine, you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up some trolls, get them armored up and ready to use.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
He looks at the player.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire showed up here looking for you. Let's go have a little chat with it, shall we?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
One visits Merethi as Harkon instructed.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I have a message from Harkon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Lord Harkon. Remember your place. Now, what is our Lord's wish?",CHARACTER,Garan,male
"He simply said ""It is time.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, well. He wants the Chalice, then. You've heard of the Bloodstone Chalice?",CHARACTER,Garan,male
I've never heard of it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It is a rather well-kept secret.,CHARACTER,Garan,male
Of course. Hasn't everyone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. Don't try and impress me. It only leaves you looking foolish. The Chalice has been in Lord Harkon's possession for quite some time now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our powers. He has neglected using it for ages. If he wants it filled now, then grander things are afoot. This is good. Follow me. I'll take you to it.",CHARACTER,Garan,male
They start walking to the dining room.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Lord Harkon has never cared to use the Chalice, relying on his more than adequate powers until now. This is an intriguing change.",CHARACTER,Garan,male
They arrive.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Excuse us. I need to fetch the Bloodstone Chalice.,CHARACTER,Garan,male
The Chalice? Why?,CHARACTER,Vingalmo,male
"What are you up to, Garan?",CHARACTER,Orthjolf,male
"Lord Harkon's orders, Orthjolf. Calm yourself. Our friend here has been ordered to fill the Chalice.",CHARACTER,Garan,male
Really?,CHARACTER,Vingalmo,male
Indeed. He's off to Redwater Den.,CHARACTER,Garan,male
"Well, then... Best of luck to you.",CHARACTER,Orthjolf,male
Vingalmo and Orthjolf are Harkon's primary advisors. I'm sure they're quite surprised to learn that you're taking the Chalice. And here we are.,CHARACTER,Garan,male
They find a large chalice on a small pedestal.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Now, this Chalice needs to be filled directly from the bloodspring that is the source of Redwater Den. But that's not enough. Once that's done, the blood of a powerful vampire needs to be added to it. Keep in mind that Redwater Den has fallen into...well, let's just say less reputable members of society now dwell there. It's your choice whether to attempt to deal with them or force your way through. Hurry back. You don't want to keep Lord Harkon waiting.",CHARACTER,Garan,male
"The player travels to Redwater Den, near Riften's Lake Honrich. The place is be preyed upon.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hold it. If you're going downstairs, you keep your weapons to yourself or we'll be getting better acquainted. Head on in and behave yourself.",CHARACTER,Doorman,male
"One way or another, one enters the back caverns and finds Redwater's spring. The overhear vampires talking nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So why don't you just drink the blood from the spring? I mean, that seems easier than running a skooma den...",CHARACTER,Thrall,male
"The boss said it's some sort of profaned spring. It looks like blood, but it's not the real thing. Drinking it gives you strength, but it also gets you pretty messed up... That's why we thought of putting it in the skooma.",CHARACTER,Vampire Mistwalker,female
"After cutting through an entire den, the spring's source is uncovered. One fills the chalice. Two Volkihar vampires show themselves.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"It's really too bad, you know. The little accident you had here, completely unexpected...",CHARACTER,Salonia Caelia,female
"Yeah, too bad. Lord Harkon's new favorite, dead so soon after joining the family.",CHARACTER,Stalf,male
"We're just lucky I was here to return the Chalice to Vingalmo, so he could make sure Harkon gets it back.",CHARACTER,Salonia,female
"Wait, what? That's not what we agreed. We take it back together.",CHARACTER,Stalf,male
"Idiot. You didn't really think I'd let you walk out of here either, did you? Vingalmo wants you both dead.",CHARACTER,Salonia,female
"Well, that's just fine. Orthjolf told me to finish off anyone who got in the way.",CHARACTER,Stalf,male
"The Dragonborn slays both traitorous vampires, then returns to Marethi.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I see you have returned. Lord Harkon will be pleased. You met Stalf and Salonia, I assume? Lord Harkon and I suspected they might follow you there.",CHARACTER,Garan,male
They tried to kill me!,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Well of course they did.,CHARACTER,Garan,male
I killed them both.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As well you should have. Welcome to the politics of Lord Harkon's court. Vingalmo and Orthjolf both long for our Lord's throne, but cannot make overt moves against him. Each sought to gain power by using his underling to kill you and keep the Chalice for himself. By ensuring the Chalice reaches our Lord, you have increased his power over them, and at the same time deprived them of their little pets. You've done Lord Harkon two great services. Take what you've learned to heart, and be careful who you trust. Now, I believe Lord Harkon wishes to speak with you.",CHARACTER,Garan,male
"The player goes with Isran to the balcony rooms, finding Serana there.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This vampire showed up while you were away. I'm guessing it's the one you found in Dimhollow Crypt. Says it's got something really important to say to you. So let's hear it.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
You probably weren't expecting to see me again.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
What are you doing here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'd rather not be here either, but I needed to talk to you. It's important, so please just listen before your friend, here, loses his patience. It's...well, it's about me. And the Elder Scroll that was buried with me.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What about the scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The reason I had it...and why I was down there. It all comes back to my father.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
What about you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The reason I was down there...and why I had the Elder Scroll. It all comes back to my father. I'm guessing you figured this part out already, but my father's not exactly a good person. Even by vampire standards. He wasn't always like that, though. There was...a turn. He stumbled onto this obscure prophecy and just kind of lost himself in it.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What sort of prophecy?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's pointless and vague, like all prophecies. The part he latched onto said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun. That's what he's after. He wants to control the sun, have vampires control the world.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"What do you mean...""lost himself""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He just became absorbed...obsessed. It was kind of sick, actually. The prophecy said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun. For someone who fancied himself as vampire royalty, that's pretty seductive. Anyway, my mother and I didn't feel like inviting a war with all of Tamriel, so we tried to stop him. That's why I was sealed away with the Scroll.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What's all this have to do with the Dawnguard?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm sorry, I had heard there were vampire hunters here. I thought they might want to know about a vampire plot to enslave the rest of the world. Was I wrong?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You took a big risk coming here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I did. But something about you makes me think I can trust you. I hope I'm not wrong.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"No, you're right. We just have to convince the others you're on our side.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, let's move then. I'm nothing if not persuasive.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You want us to help you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That was the plan, yes. Assuming the rest of them can trust a vampire. Come on, I'll need you to help convince them.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"All right, you've heard what it has to say. Now tell me, is there any reason I shouldn't kill this bloodsucking fiend right now?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
Because we're going to need her help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Why, because of that story about the prophecy? About some vampire trying to put the sun out? Do you actually believe any of that?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
Why else would she risk her life to come here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Who knows, maybe it has a death wish. Maybe it's just insane. I don't really care.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Set your hatred aside and try to see the larger picture, Isran.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Set my hatred aside? Not a chance. It's what keeps me strong.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
"You don't trust her, fine. Trust me. I believe here.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You'd better know what you're doing. It can stay for now, but if it so much as lays a finger on anyone here, I'll hold you responsible. Got it?",CHARACTER,Isran,male
He turns to Serana.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You hear me? Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a resource. You're an asset. In the meantime, don't make me regret my sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your friend here is going to pay for it.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Thank you for your kindness. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling hungry. So, in case you didn't notice the giant thing I have on my back, I have the Elder Scroll with me. Whatever it says, it will have something that can help us. But of course, neither of us can read it.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Who can?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, the Moth Priests are the only ones I've heard who can do it. They spend years preparing before they start reading, though. Not that it helps us, anyway, because they're half a continent away in Cyrodiil.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Some Imperial scholar arrived in Skyrim a few days ago. I was staking out the road when I saw him pass by. Maybe that's your Moth Priest.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
Do you know where he's staying now?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"No, and I'm not going to waste men looking. We're fighting a war against your kind, and I intend to win it. You want to find him, try talking to anyone who'd meet a traveler. Innkeepers and carriage drivers in the big cities maybe. But you're on your own.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
Any idea on how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty big place. Do you have any ideas?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Where would a Moth Priest actually go?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, back before I...you know. The College of Winterhold was the first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing. The wizards know about all kinds of things that people probably shouldn't know about.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Actually, now that I think of it...I'm going to come along with you. I've been really wanting to get out and explore a bit.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"I'd...well, I'd come with you, but I don't know if I can trust your friend. Let me know if you want me along.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"There are many ways to find leads, such as those Harkon suggested. The most can ask the librarian.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I need to find a Moth Priest.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
A Moth Priest? What in Oblivion do you want a Moth Priest for?,CHARACTER,Urag,male
My business is my own. Just tell me what I need to know.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Fine, fine. No need to get your breeches in a twist. The obvious answer is to go to the Imperial City. The Moth Priests make their home in the White Gold Tower. Sometimes they go out looking for Elder Scrolls. Lucky for you, there's a Moth Priest in Skyrim right now, doing just that. He stopped in to do some research in the library, then left for Dragon Bridge. If you hurry, you might catch him there.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
"If one asks a carriage driver instead, they will all give the same answer:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Have you seen a Moth Priest?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's one of them Imperial scholars, right? Old man with a gray robe?",CHARACTER,Driver,male
That's right. You've seen him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Might be that I have, but I can't say for sure. I got enough troubles on my mind just tryin' to scrape by out here.",CHARACTER,Driver,male
"Please, it's very important that I find him. (Persuade)",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that I think on it, I did see your priest. He tried to hire me for a trip to Dragon Bridge, but I told him that ain't one of my stops.",CHARACTER,Driver,male
"Can't help you, friend. I might remember better if my pockets weren't so light.",CHARACTER,Driver,male
Maybe this will put your mind at ease. ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah yes, I remember your Moth Priest now. He wanted me to take him out to Dragon Bridge, but I told him it ain't one of my stops.",CHARACTER,Driver,male
An' maybe it won't.,CHARACTER,Driver,male
"Never mind, I'll look somewhere else.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Suits me just fine.,CHARACTER,Driver,male
"Some innkeepers may not be able to give information. Others, like Hulda in as below.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Heard anything about a moth priest passing through?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Have I heard anything? It was the talk of the city for three days straight. Ain't too often we get a visitor like that.,CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
Where is he now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, he just left a short while ago. He said he'd finished up his work and it was time to move on. That's all I can tell you. He asked me not to let anyone know where he was going. I suppose he didn't want the attention.",CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
It's important that I find him right away. (Persuade),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, well, in that case, I'll tell you what I know. He took the road southwest out of town, and he said he was going to be crossing over the Dragon Bridge. That's all he told me. I hope it helps.",CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
"It's like I said, I'm not going to talk about it.",CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
Finding that Moth Priest is worth a lot to me. ( gold),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I can see that. He said he was heading for Dragon Bridge next. I hope that helps you.,CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
"Sorry, but that Moth Priest's comings and goings are none of my business, and none of yours either.",CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
I'll try my luck elsewhere.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Never much cared for folks who can't mind their own business.,CHARACTER,Corpulus,male
"With the info found, one heads to Dragon Bridge. Across the titular landmark, the priest, captured in an ancient barrier, and questioned by a vampire.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The more you fight me, the more you will suffer, mortal.",CHARACTER,Malkus,male
"I will resist you, monster. I must!",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"How much longer can you keep this up, Moth Priest? Your mind was strong, but you're exhausted from the struggle.",CHARACTER,Malkus,male
Must... resist...,CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"Yes, I can feel your defenses crumbling. You want it to end. You want to give in to me. Now, acknowledge me as your master!",CHARACTER,Malkus,male
Yes. master.,CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"They kill the vampires, then release Dexion. However, the bewitched priest is hostile, attacking immediately.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies will pay!",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"He's soon defeated, snapping out of it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Wait, stop! I yield! That...that wasn't me you were fighting. I could see through my eyes, but I could not control my actions. Thank you for breaking that foul vampire's hold over me.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Are you alright?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm quite alright, thanks to you. Dexion Evicus is my name. I'm a Moth Priest of the White Gold Tower. These vampires claimed they had some purpose in store for me, but they wouldn't say what. Probably holding me for ransom, the fools.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"I know why they needed you, because we need you for the same purpose.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You do? Alright then, enough mysteries.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"We're called the Dawnguard, and we need you to read an Elder Scroll.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You have an Elder Scroll? Remarkable! If my knowledge of history serves me, I recall that the Dawnguard was an ancient order of vampire hunters. I will be happy to assist you with your Elder Scroll. Just tell me where I need to go.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"I'll explain later. Right now, we need your help and time is short.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, you saved me from those vampires. I suppose the least I can do is hear you out.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"You can find us at Fort Dawnguard, near Stendarr's Beacon.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Very well. I'll hurry on my way there before more of those vampires turn up.,CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Everyone rendezvous at the Fort.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm impressed you could find a Moth Priest so quickly.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
Does he have the Scroll? Is everything ready?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
For the reading? Yeah. Just let the old man know when you're ready.,CHARACTER,Isran,male
"Ah, hello there!",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"Glad you made it here safely, Dexion.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, my rescuer! It's good to see you again.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Have my companions made you feel welcome?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's not exactly the hospitality I'm used to, but your man Isran has seen to my needs well enough. And might I add, this is a remarkable fortress. I have colleagues back home that would love to study this place in detail.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Are you prepared to read the Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, most certainly! Let's find out what secrets the scroll can tell. Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must concentrate.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
He opens the legendary scroll.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon! It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying ""Among the night's children, a dread lord will rise. In an age of strife, when dragons return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the night and day will be as one."" The voice fades and the words begin to shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls. I must rest now. The reading has made me weary.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"Come on, old man. You should get some rest.",CHARACTER,Isran,male
"After returning the Chalice to its proper place, one returns to Harkon.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, you are here. Good.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
You wanted to speak to me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I did. When I told you that I was grateful for my daughter's safe return, I told the truth. But I did not tell you everything.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I suspected as much.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Good. Strong instincts and a cunning mind will serve you as well as blade, spell or claw.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
When do you plan to start trusting me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Do not presume to tell me who I can and cannot trust. I possess the wisdom of a dozen lifetimes, and I will make my own judgements. Now be silent, and hear what I have to say. As you know, vampires are powerful but we have limits. Our great enemy is the sun, and until recently it's an enemy we've had no way to fight. For centuries I searched for an answer to this problem. I found an old prophecy written by a Moth Priest, those scholars who read the Elder Scrolls. The prophecy tells of a time in which vampires will gain power over the sun, and will no longer fear its tyranny. I believe the secret to unraveling that prophecy is written in Serana's Elder Scroll. I have ordered the court to assemble. I have a new task for us all to carry out, and that includes you. Come now, and hear my proclamation.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
Harkon stands to address the other Volikhar vampires.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Scions of the night! Hear my words! The prophesied time is at last upon us. Soon we will claim dominion over the sun itself, and forge a new realm of eternal darkness. Now that I have reclaimed one of my Elder Scrolls, we must find a Moth Priest to read it. I have spread false rumors about the discovery of an Elder Scroll in Skyrim to lure a Moth Priest here. Now it is time to see if those efforts have borne fruit. Go forth, and search the land for rumors of a Moth Priest within our borders. Look to the cities. Speak to the innkeepers, carriage drivers, anyone who would meet a traveler. Go now, and carry out this task. This is my command!",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
A Moth Priest?,CHARACTER,Ronthil,male
It will be done my lord!,CHARACTER,Garan,male
Hm. Most intriguing.,CHARACTER,Vingalmo,male
Feran Sedri and Hestla run out immediately.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Any idea on how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty big place. Do you have any ideas?,CHARACTER,Serana,female

"I'd...well, I'd come with you, but I don't know if I can trust your friend. Let me know if you want me along.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
The methods of finding info are the same as in the Dawnguard version of this light barrier and overhear the Dawnguard talking.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Those vampires put up a hell of a fight.""",CHARACTER,Dawnguard Lieutenant,female
"I just hope we weren't too late. I'm not sure what they did to this Moth Priest, but he doesn't look right.",CHARACTER,Vanik,male
You think they turned him?,CHARACTER,Dawnguard Lieutenant,female
"I don't know, maybe. Won't know until we get him out of there.",CHARACTER,Vanik,male
How do we do that?,CHARACTER,Dawnguard Lieutenant,female
"I'm working on it, now give me some silence so I can think.",CHARACTER,Vanik,male
"The player slaughters the former allies, takes the weystone focus from the and angry.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies will pay!",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"One uses a vampiric seduction spell for calming, then feeds on him.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"By the divines! It's as if my eyes have been opened! I am blinded by the light of your majesty. I...I must obey you. What would you have of me, master?",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
I command you to travel to Castle Volkihar.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Certainly. Where can I find this castle?,CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"Off the northern coast of Skyrim, due west of Solitude.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll set out at once, then.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
The good news is soon reported to Harkon.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Well done! Somehow I knew it would be you and Serana who found our moth priest.,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
I have made the Moth Priest my thrall.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I see that. I trust his capture was not too difficult a task?",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"The Dawnguard tried to stop me, but they posed no threat.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I wish I could have been there to hear the sounds of their screams.,CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"The Dawnguard were there. They fought well, but not well enough.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They are determined and well-armed, but foolish if they think they can defy us. We will deal with them in time.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"The Dawnguard were protecting him, and they nearly killed me.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We both know that a band of fools with crossbows is no match for a scion of the ancient blood. I admit, I do not entirely understand your sense of humor. Well, your thrall awaits and we have given him the Elder Scroll. Command him to read it, and let us hear the words of prophecy together.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
One finds Dexion nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Master, I have done as you asked and traveled here.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"I have a new task for you, thrall.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. What is it that you need me to do?,CHARACTER,Dexion,male
You must read an Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ah, yes, the Elder Scroll! I admit, I'm looking forward to this.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Then you may begin your reading.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course, master. Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must concentrate.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
He takes out the legendary scroll.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon! It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying ""Among the night's children, a dread lord will rise.

To know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"That was...not as useful as I would have liked. Even so, you did well.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
Do you know where these other scrolls are?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My traitor wife stole one of them away and then disappeared. As for the other, the last that I heard, it was lost in the bowels of a Dwemer ruin. It seems our work is not yet done. But I have waited this long, and we are so very close now. I can wait a bit longer.",CHARACTER,Harkon,male
"After the crowd disperses following the Scroll's reading, Serana approaches. options may only make sense or appear based off that.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Do you have a moment to talk?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
What's on your mind?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That Moth Priest, Dexion. He said we needed two other Elder Scrolls. I think I know where we can start looking.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Can't it wait?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, you could waste a lot of time trying to figure out our next move, or you could let me help. Your choice.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why didn't you say something earlier?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Didn't want that lot getting wind of it. Especially my father.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Half the people in your little crew would just as soon kill me as talk to me. That doesn't exactly make me want to open up. I got a warmer welcome from my father, and that's saying something.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What is it between the two of you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ever since he decided to make that prophecy his calling, we kind of drifted apart.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Do you trust Harkon at all?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It's not a question of trust...he's just obsessed with the prophecy. And from what I can tell, an thousand extra years of obsession haven't made him any better. We should have found him a hobby.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Does Harkon even care about you anymore?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You know, I've asked myself the same thing. I thought...I hoped that if he saw me, he might feel something again. But I guess I don't really factor in at this point. I don't think he even sees me as his daughter anymore. I'm just...a means to an end.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
So where is this Elder Scroll?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We need to find my mother, Valerica. She'll definitely know where it is, and if we're lucky, she actually has it herself.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You said you didn't know where she went.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The last time I saw her, she said that she'd go somewhere safe... somewhere that my father would never search. Other than that, she wouldn't tell me anything. But the way she said it...""someplace he'd never search."" It was cryptic, yet she called attention to it.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Sounds like she was being cautious.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Maybe. What I can't figure out is why she said it that way.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
We can't waste time on cryptic clues.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you have a better lead than this, I'm all ears.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Maybe your mother didn't trust you, either.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's always a possibility. She was almost as obsessed as my father by the time she shut me in. But I can't worry about that now. We need the scroll, and she's our only lead. Besides, I can't imagine a single place my father would avoid looking. And he's had all this time, too. Any ideas?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Hiding with the Dawnguard?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I doubt my mother would waste her time with those fools. They probably would have tried to kill her, and that has a way of souring relationships. Any other ideas?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They'd be even less welcoming to her than they've been to me. It would have been a bloodbath. And since the Dawnguard are still around, that must not have happened. Any other ideas?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Sealed away like you were?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't think so. She said she wanted to stay awake in case the situation was resolved. It had to be one of us, and, well, she's so much more powerful than I am. It just made sense for her to be out there. Anything else?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"How about right here, in the castle? / In Castle Volkihar?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Wait...that almost makes sense!,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I used to help my mother tend a garden in the courtyard here.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
There's a courtyard in the castle. I used to help her tend a garden there.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
All of the ingredients for our potions came from there. She used to say that my father couldn't stand the place. Too...peaceful.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Isn't that pretty risky, staying around the castle?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, absolutely. But my mother's not a coward. That is...I don't think we'll actually trip over her there. But it's worth a look.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
How can we get in without your father noticing?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Trust me. I lived here for a very long time and I know every nook and cranny.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
They aren't going to let us use the front door.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
True. But I know a way we can get to the courtyard without arousing suspicion. There's an unused inlet on the northern side of the island that was used by the previous owners to bring supplies into the castle. An old escape tunnel from the castle exits there. I think that's our way in.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Let's go to the castle's secret entrance.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Come on. It's just around the side.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
It's around the side of the castle. Let's move.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Well, I don't take just anyone into the secret parts of the place I grew up. Get rid of this interloper and you and I can be on our way. I'll wait for you at the dock.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Actually, I have some things to do first.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Don't let me stand in your way, then. I'll be at the dock whenever you're ready.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
The two walk the Volkihar shore clockwise toward the inlet.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Yeah, just around this bend. Castle looks so big from down here. I mean, it is big, but, well, even bigger.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Together, the player and Serana enter the deserted undercroft.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The old water cistern. One some days, this smell would just...be glad you weren't here then. Take a left up here. This is one of those weird double-barred security measures that my father put in when he got more paranoid. If we follow that path around, we can find the other switch. This leads out to the courtyard. Just head for the door.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They continue on, eventually reaching the old garden, now gone to seed.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"We've made it to the courtyard. Oh no... What happened to this place? Everything's been torn down... The whole place looks...well, dead. It's like we're the first to set foot here in centuries. This used to lead into the castle's great hall. It looks like my father had it sealed up. I used to walk through here after evening meals. It was beautiful, once. This was my mother's garden. It...do you know how beautiful something can be when it's tended by a master for hundreds of years? She would have hated to see it like this. Wait... Something's wrong with the moondial here. Some of the crests are missing and the dial is askew. I didn't even know the crests could be removed. Maybe my mother's trying to tell us something? I'm telling you, there's something strange with the moondial.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
The player can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What happened to the castle courtyard?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If I had to guess, I'd say the moment mother fled the castle, father went on a rampage. Knowing him, anything at all that reminded him of her was just destroyed.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Then he just walled it off.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It appears that way. I suppose he wanted to put the past behind him. Perhaps if he had spent more time with us, he would have recognized the beauty for himself.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What's so special about the moondial?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, as far as I'm aware it's the only one in existence. The previous owners of the castle had a sundial in the courtyard, and obviously that didn't appeal to my mother. She persuaded an elven artisan to make some improvements. You can see the plates that show the phases of the moons, Masser and Secunda.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Does it work?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's the thing...what's the point of a moondial? I always wondered why she didn't just have the whole thing ripped out. But she loved it. I don't know. I guess it's like having a piece of art, if you're into that sort of thing.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
So what exactly am I doing to it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hard to say. Maybe if we found the missing crests, we could figure it out. Look around for the missing crests. Even in this mess, they should stick out.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"The player finds the crest, then places them correctly. The sundial reveals a hidden stairway below it.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Very clever, mother. Very clever. I've never been in those tunnels before, but I'd bet they run right under the courtyard and into the tower ruins. Well, at least we're getting closer. Let's go.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They pull a hidden wall back with a lever, revealing a bloody kitchen.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I've never even seen this part of the castle before. Be careful. I don't know what might be around.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They continue through the ancient halls, constantly ascending.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I don't think we've reached the top yet. I'd bet there's some kind of secret passage around here.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
They find a path behind the fireplace.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Leave it to my mother...always smarter than I gave her credit for.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They reach the tower's apex, Valerica's old laboratory.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Look at this place. This has to be it! I knew she was deep into necromancy. I mean, she taught me everything I know. But I had no idea she had a setup like this. Look at all this. She must have spent years collecting these components. And what's this thing?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
She looks at a floor indentation with many concentric circles.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm not sure about this circle, but it's obviously...something. Let's take a look around. There has to be something here that tells us where she's gone.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Do you think this would help? (Give journal),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You've found her journal! Let me take a look at it. (jump to ""What's this ""Soul Cairn""..."")",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What exactly are we looking for?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My mother was meticulous about her research. If we can find her notes, there might be some hints in there.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Did your mother keep gargoyles here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Not that I ever saw. My mother had a bit of a thing for magical constructs. Not...not what you're thinking. She just found them fascinating.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Your mother maintained quite a laboratory.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I had no idea that her laboratory even existed. She had an alchemy setup in her drawing room, but nothing that even comes close to what's here.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What did she research?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Looking at the equipment and materials, it looks like she was trying to advance her necromancy.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
To what end?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I don't know. Certainly not longevity. Kind of a waste of time for a vampire. I remember she used to keep a small journal. See if you can dig it up.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
A journal is found on a shelf.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I've found your mother's notes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You did? Let me see them.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"What's this ""Soul Cairn"" that she mentions?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I only know what she told me. She had a theory about soul gems. That the souls inside of them don't just vanish when they're used...they end up in the Soul Cairn.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Why did she care where used souls went?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Soul Cairn is home to very powerful beings. Necromancers send them souls, and receive powers of their own in return. My mother spent a lot of time trying to contact them directly, to travel to the Soul Cairn itself.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"If she made it there, we'll find her.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That circle in the center of the room is definitely some type of portal. If I'm reading this right, there's a formula here that should give us safe passage into the Soul Cairn.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What do we need?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A handful of soul gem shards, some finely-ground bone meal, a good bit of purified void salts... Oh...damn it...",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What's wrong?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We're also going to need a sample of her blood. Which...if we could get that, we wouldn't even be trying to do this in the first place.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You share her blood.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmmm. Not bad. We'd better hope that's good enough. Mistakes with these kinds of portals can be...gruesome. Anyway, enough of that. Let's get started.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Are all of those ingredients here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, definitely. Mother would have plenty of those materials in her laboratory, you just need to find them.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
I already found all of the ingredients.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, good. Well then...let's head over to the portal vessel and I'll do the rest.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
The player collects the items and puts them in the vessel.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Then the rest is up to me. Are you ready to go? I'm not entirely sure what this thing is going to do when I add my blood.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Can I ask you something first?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course. What is it?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
What will you do if we find your mother?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I've been asking myself the same thing since we came back to the castle. She was so sure of what we did to my father, I couldn't help but go along with her. I never thought of the cost.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
It sounds like she did everything for your sake.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Possibly. I guess even a vampire mother is still a mother. She worried about me. About all of us. But she wanted to get me as far away from my father as possible before he really went over the edge.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I don't know what she was thinking.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Neither do I. She always seemed happy, before we heard the prophecy. Then it all changed. She became a different person. They both did.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
It sounds like she was pretty selfish.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"She wasn't, always. But I think you're right. She was practically smirking as we left home. Almost like she was proud of herself. Like she didn't just want to stop my father...she wanted to stick it to him, too.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
We won't know until we find her.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes...yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I just didn't expect anyone to care how I felt about her. Thank you. Are we ready then?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Let's get that portal open.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
All right. Here goes.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"I have some preparations to make, first.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'll be here. Don't take too long, now!",CHARACTER,Serana,female
I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Okay, here goes.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Putting the blood in the vessel opens an otherworldly portal.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
By the blood of my ancestors... She actually did it...created a portal to the Soul Cairn. Incredible.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"If one isn't a vampire, the Soul Cairn portal rejects the player.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Are you alright? That looked painful.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
It was. What happened?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that I think about it...I should have expected that. Sorry. It's hard to describe. The Soul Cairn is...well, hungry, for lack of a better word. It's trying to take your life essence as payment.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"So there's no way in, then.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There might be, but I don't think you're going to like it. Vampires aren't counted among the living. I could probably go through there without a problem.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Are you saying that I need to become a vampire?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Not your first choice, I'd guess.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
There has to be another way.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Maybe. We could just ""pay the toll"" another way. It wants a soul, so we give it a soul. Yours.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Wouldn't that kill me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My mother taught me a trick or two. I could partially soul trap you, and offer that gem to the Ideal Masters. It might be enough to satisfy them. It would make you a bit weaker when we travel through the Soul Cairn, but we might be able to fix that once we're inside. Maybe.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Those are my only options?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm sorry. I wish I knew a better way, something that would be easier for you. Just know that...whatever path you choose, I won't think any less of you. Sometimes things just have to be done. I know that better than anybody.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
If one decides to become a vampire to gain entry:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I don't see another way. I'll become a vampire.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Are you sure? I'm willing to turn you, but you need to think it through. You'd become the very thing you'd sworn to destroy. I don't know how the Dawnguard will react.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You're right. Let me think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I understand. Take your time.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Turning someone is a very...personal thing for vampires. It's intimate. For us. I don't want you to feel like I'm forcing you into this.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"In that case, I'm glad you're the one doing it.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Let's not waste too much time, then.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
I understand.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Good.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Let's just get it over with.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
As you wish. I promise to try and make this as painless as possible. Hold still.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
If one decides to get soul trapped to gain entry:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Soul trap me. I won't feel right as a vampire.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Are you sure? I'm willing to do it, but you need to think it through. You'll remain mortal, but you'll find yourself weakened within the Soul Cairn.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You're right. Let me think about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I understand. Take your time.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I know this is difficult for you. I hope you trust me. I'd never do anything that could hurt you.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I trust you completely.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Thank you.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Don't worry about it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Oh. Good.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Let's just get this over with.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
As you wish. I promise to make this as painless as possible. Hold still. Let's go. My mother must be waiting on the other side of that thing.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Once one is soul-trapped or vampirized, the team can finally descend the steps into the magnificent new location.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"With one Scroll in hand, and one apparently in Valerica's hands, it's time to as before. One seeks out the librarian.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm looking for an Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking about?,CHARACTER,Urag,male
Tell me more about the Elder Scrolls.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't even have the proper questions. An Elder Scroll is an instrument of immense knowledge and power. To read an Elder Scroll, a person must have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness. Even so, the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
A price for what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The simplest way to put it is ""knowledge,"" but there's nothing simple about an Elder Scroll. It's a reflection of all possible futures and all possible pasts. Each reader sees different reflections through different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading. But at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially the falsehoods.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Who wrote the Elder Scrolls?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't even make sense. The Scrolls exist here, with us, but are also beyond and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance so we could know them. Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who study them devoutly go mad.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
All right. So do you have one that I could use?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Ha!,CHARACTER,Urag,male
Of course I do. Do you have one here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You think even if I did have one here, I would let you see it? It would be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Do you at least have any information on them?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Of course.,CHARACTER,Urag,male
I need to find one and was told you could help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have are plenty of books. I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much. So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
He gets out a book written by Septimus Signus.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"This ""Ruminations"" book is incomprehensible.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus. He's the world's master on the nature of Elder Scrolls, but...well. He's been gone for a long while. Too long.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
Where did he go?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Somewhere up north, in the ice fields. Said he found some old Dwemer artifact, but...well, that was years ago. Haven't heard from him since.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
He's dead?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were close. Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. Somewhere in the ice fields, if you want to try and find him.",CHARACTER,Urag,male
"At this point, the quest ends, and ""Discerning the Transmundane"" begins. It's done to find the scroll. See that section for relevant details.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The player and Serana enter the Soul Cairn, a dark, twisted landscape with the fog-covered area.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• Let's keep moving. I feel like we're being watched. • I'd heard stories about the Soul Cairn, but never thought I'd see it myself. So far it's...about what I imagined.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They make for a far-off castle with twin energy spires. There, one finds a barrier preventing entrance. Valerica is trapped on the other side.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Mother!,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Maker...it can't be. Serana?!,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Is it really you? I can't believe it! How do we get inside? We have to talk.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Serana? What are you doing here? Where's your father?,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
He doesn't know we're here. I don't have time to explain.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"I must have failed. Harkon's found a way to decipher the prophecy, hasn't he.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to complete the prophecy our way, not his.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Wait a moment...you've brought a stranger here? Have you lost your mind?,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"No, you don't...",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You. Come forward. I would speak with you. • So how has it come to pass that a vampire of mixed blood is in the company of my daughter? • So how has it come to pass that a vampire hunter is in the company of my daughter? It pains me to think you'd travel with Serana under the guise her protector in an effort to hunt me down.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I've been keeping her safe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Safe? You call bringing her here safe? Has she explained nothing to you?,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
This is no ruse. I want to keep her safe.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Coming from one who murders vampires as a trade, I find it hard to believe your intentions are noble.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I've saved her from your foolish plan.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I find your choice of words quite interesting considering that Serana is in far more danger now than she was following my ""foolish plan.""",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I'm just here for the Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Glorious. Serana claims you're her guardian, yet your first instinct appears to be greed. I see that my daughter is still as naive as ever. Serana has sacrificed everything to prevent Harkon from completing the prophecy. I would have expected her to explain that to you.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
That's why I'm here for the Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You think I'd have the audacity to place my own daughter in that tomb for the protection of her Elder Scroll alone? The scrolls are merely a means to an end. The key to the Tyranny of the Sun is Serana herself.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What do you mean?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"When I fled Castle Volkihar, I fled with two Elder Scrolls. The scroll I presume you found with Serana speaks of Auriel and his arcane weapon, Auriel's Bow. The second scroll declares that ""The Blood of Coldharbour's Daughter will blind the eye of the Dragon.""",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
How does Serana fit in?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Like myself, Serana was a human once. We were devout followers of Lord Molag Bal. Tradition dictates the females be offered to Molag Bal on his summoning day. Few survive the ordeal. Those that do emerge as a pure-blooded vampire. We call such confluences the ""Daughters of Coldharbour.""",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
The Tyranny of the Sun requires Serana's blood?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now you're beginning to see why I wanted to protect Serana, and why I've kept the other Elder Scroll as far from her as possible.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Serana underwent this ritual willingly?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It was expected of her, just as it was expected of me. Being selected as an offering to Molag Bal is an honor. She wouldn't have dared turn her back on that.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Coldharbour?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It's what some call the domain of Molag Bal. His place in Oblivion.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Are you saying Harkon means to kill her?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If Harkon obtained Auriel's Bow and Serana's blood was used to taint the weapon, the Tyranny of the Sun would be complete. In his eyes, she'd be dying for the good of all vampires.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I would never allow that to happen.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
And how exactly do you plan on completing the prophecy without the death of my daughter?,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I'll kill Harkon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you believe that, then you're a bigger fool than I originally suspected. Don't you think I weighed that option before I enacted my plans?",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I'll need your help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Have you been listening to me? Like Serana, I'm a pure-blooded vampire. My presence on Tamriel is as much of a danger as hers is.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Perhaps her death is destined.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No! I will not allow that to happen. The Elder Scrolls only tell of events that might be, not events that will be.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
And Serana's opinion on this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You care nothing for Serana or our plight. • You see the Tyranny of the Sun as your chance at deification, and like Harkon you won't hesitate to destroy anything that stands in your path. • Whether or not you've become one of us in order to survive the Soul Cairn, you're still a vampire hunter at heart. You're here because we're abominations in your mind. Evil creatures that need to be destroyed.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"Serana believes in me, why won't you?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Serana? This stranger may call himself vampire, but he knows nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to him?",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"This stranger aligns himself with those who would hunt you down and slay you like an animal, yet I should entrust you to him?",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
I'm just here for the Elder Scroll.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I see. You're simply here to stop the Tyranny of the Sun, despite the cost to Serana. Nothing else matters.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"This ""stranger"" has done more for me in the brief time I've known him than you've done in centuries!",CHARACTER,Serana,female
How dare you! I gave up everything I cared about to protect you from that fanatic you call a father!,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"Yes, he's a fanatic...he's changed. But he's still my father. Why can't you understand how that makes me feel?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Oh, Serana. If you'd only open your eyes. The moment your father discovers your role in the prophecy, that he needs your blood, you'd be in terrible danger.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"So to protect me, you decided to shut me away from everything I cared about? You never asked me if hiding in that tomb was the best course of action, you just expected me to follow you blindly. Both of you were obsessed with your own paths. Your motivations might have been different, but in the end, I'm still just a pawn to you, too. I want us to be a family again. But I don't know if we can ever have that. Maybe we don't deserve that kind of happiness. Maybe it isn't for us. But we have to stop him. Before he goes too far. And to do that, we need the Elder Scroll.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"I'm sorry, Serana. I didn't know...I didn't see. I've allowed my hatred of your father to estrange us for too long. Forgive me. If you want the Elder Scroll, it's yours.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
She turns to the player.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Your intentions are still somewhat unclear to me. But for Serana's sake, I'll assist you in any way that I can.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Do you have the Elder Scroll with you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. I've kept it safely secured here ever since I was imprisoned. • Fortunately, you seem to have already killed the Keepers maintaining the barrier around these ruins.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Does that mean you can take us to it now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Please, follow me. One more word of warning. There's a dragon that calls itself Durnehviir roaming the Cairn. The Ideal Masters have charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly investigate the fact that the barrier has fallen.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"Fortunately, you're in a position to breach the barrier that surrounds these ruins.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What do we need to do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You need to locate the tallest of the rocky spires that surround these ruins. At their bases, the barrier's energy is being drawn from unfortunate souls that have been exiled here. Destroy the Keepers that are tending them, and it should bring the barrier down.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
We'll return soon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"One more word of warning. There's a dragon that calls itself Durnehviir roaming the Cairn. Be wary of him. The Ideal Masters have charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly intervene if you're perceived as a threat. Be careful, and keep my daughter safe.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Let's kill those...Keeper things and get back to the prison.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
One can ask further questions.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How did you become imprisoned here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"When I entered the Soul Cairn, I had intended to strike a bargain with the Ideal Masters, the custodians of this place.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What was the bargain?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I requested refuge in the Soul Cairn, and in exchange, I would provide the Ideal Masters the souls that they craved. If I had foreseen the value they placed on my own soul, I would never have come here.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
They tricked you.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Ideal Masters unleashed their Keepers and sent them to destroy me. Fortunately, I was able to hold them at bay and retreat into these ruins.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
You became trapped.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Unfortunately, yes. Since the Keepers weren't able to claim my soul, they had their minions construct a barrier that I'd never be able to breach.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
You've been imprisoned here for all this time?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Time has very little meaning to me. Consequently, it has little meaning to the Ideal Masters as well. I suppose you could call this the ultimate waiting game, each watching the other to see which will give in.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"If I leave the Soul Cairn, can I safely return?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As you've been traveling in the Soul Cairn, your body has become attuned to it. Let's just say a tiny part of you rubbed off on it, and in its place, a bit of the Soul Cairn filled the void. You should find no difficulty using the portal any longer.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Why haven't you pursued the prophecy?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Harkon's vision is a world plunged in eternal darkness where the vampire can flourish and never again fear the ""tyranny of the sun."" What he fails to realize is how much attention would be called to our kind if the prophecy came to fruition.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What sort of attention?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If eternal night fell, there are many who wouldn't stand for it. They would raise armies in attempts to return things to normal. The order of the day would be our destruction until every last vampire was hunted down and eliminated.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
So you prefer living in the shadows.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I do. It's how the vampire has survived for millennia, and the only way we can continue to survive in the future.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Who are the Ideal Masters?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I know very little about them. They're mystic entities that lord over the Soul Cairn, controlling every aspect from its fabric to its appearance.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What do they resemble?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, some necromancers believe they are the crystalline structures dotting the Soul Cairn. I believe there's more to it than that.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
How so?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I think they transcend what we perceive as a physical form. Perhaps they were once corporeal beings, but they've obviously reached a point where they no longer require a tangible presence.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
And the crystals?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Conduits through which the Ideal Masters speak to their underlings and feed on their victims.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Why would they require sustenance?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Ideal Masters's weakness is their insatiable hunger for pure souls. It's the reason for the Soul Cairn's existence, and the only leverage a necromancer has when bargaining with them.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What do the Masters provide in return?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The ability to summon powerful undead guardians as one would conjure an atronach or daedra. However, the majority of necromancers that are foolish enough to enter into a bargain with the Ideal Masters wind up here...as harvested souls.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"The player slays three Keepers, dispelling the barrier.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You managed to destroy all three Keepers? Very impressive.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Are you able to give us the scroll now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. Please, follow me. Keep watch for Durnehviir. With the prison's barrier down, he's almost certain to investigate.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
They enter the prison's large courtyard.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Wait...I hear something!,CHARACTER,Serana,female
It's Durnehviir...he's here! Defend yourselves!,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"They fight the ancient dragon, fending off the skeletons his powers start to resurrect. Eventually, they stamp out his attacks.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Forgive my astonishment, but I never thought I'd witness the death of that dragon.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
What makes you say that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Volumes written on Durnehviir allege that he can't be slain by normal means. It appears they were mistaken. Unless...,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Go on.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The soul of a dragon is as resilient as its owner's scaly hide. It's possible that your killing blow merely displaced Durnehviir's physical form while he reconstitutes himself.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
How long will that take?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Minutes? Hours? Years? I can't even begin to guess. I suggest we don't wait around to find out. Now, let's get your Elder Scroll and you can be on your way.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"Come on, she's leading us to the scroll.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
They find a sheltered alcove across the courtyard. One takes the scroll from an ornate box.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"That's it. That's the last scroll. Come on, let's take it to Dexion.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Now that you've retrieved the Elder Scroll, you should be on your way. If there's anything I can do before you depart, you must let me know.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Can you help me get my soul back?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So my daughter applied some of the lessons I taught her about necromancy, did she? Don't worry, I think I can help you.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"Good, I could use all the help I can get.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your soul essence was trapped inside a gem. When you and Serana entered the Soul Cairn, it was ""given"" to the Ideal Masters as payment. You simply need to retrieve the gem. The moment you touch it, your soul essence will be restored.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
Any idea where it could be?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's an offering altar not terribly far from here. I'm willing to bet that the gem you're looking for is there. Is there anything else? Could be your last chance.,CHARACTER,Valerica,female
You're staying here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I have no choice. As I told you before, I'm a Daughter of Coldharbour. If I return to Tamriel, that increases Harkon's likelihood of bringing the Tyranny of the Sun to fruition.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
We'll return for you when we can.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I appreciate your concern for me, but Serana is all I care about. You must keep her safe at all costs.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
We could use your help in Tamriel.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As much as it pains me to send you and Serana back alone, I can't take the risk.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
We may never return.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"After what I've put Serana through, I would understand if she never wished to see me again. I leave that decision in your hands. Remember that Harkon is not to be trusted. No matter what he promises, he'll deceive you in order to get what he wants. And promise me you'll keep my daughter safe. She's the only thing of value I have left. Farewell. Remember that Harkon's not to be trusted.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"I'm glad we found the scroll, but I...I wish she could come with us.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Dragonborn can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Why don't you come back with us?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Even if I could, it would only serve to hinder your efforts. Harkon would likely sense my return to Tamriel. The last thing you need right now is a trail for him to follow.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"You said ""even if I could."" Why?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Like Serana, I am a Daughter of Coldharbour, an vampire offspring of Molag Bal. My presence in Tamriel would simply double the risk that Harkon could complete the prophecy.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
And if Harkon failed?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The only way I'd even consider returning to Tamriel was if Harkon were not only to fail, but to be destroyed.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
You hate him that much?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You must understand that he's no longer the man I married all that time ago. He's obsessed...insane. Everyone around him fears him as they would a rabid dog. For all of this to end, he must die.",CHARACTER,Valerica,female
"They exit the boneyard, only to find Durnehviir's spectral form waiting.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Stay your weapons. I would speak with you, Qahnaarin.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
I thought you were dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Cursed, not dead. Doomed to exist in this form for all eternity. Trapped between laas and dinok, between life and death.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
Why are we speaking?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I believe in civility among seasoned warriors, and I find your ear worthy of my words. My claws have rended flesh from innumerable foes, but I have never once been felled on the field of battle. I therefore honor-name you ""Qahnaarin,"" or Vanquisher in your tongue.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
I found you equally worthy.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your words do me great honor. My desire to speak with you was born from the result of our battle, Qahnaarin. I merely wish to respectfully ask a favor of you.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
Didn't you try to kill me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The hostility was necessary. I was bound to an oath.,CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
I have more pressing matters at the moment.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Forgive me, Qahnaarin. We will continue this when time releases you from its relentless grasp.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
What kind of favor?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"For countless years I've roamed the Soul Cairn, in unintended service to the Ideal Masters. Before this, I roamed the skies above Tamriel. I desire to return there.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
What's stopping you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I fear that my time here has taken its toll on me. I share a bond with this dreaded place. If I ventured far from the Soul Cairn, my strength would begin to wane until I was no more.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
How could I help?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I will place my name with you and grant you the right to call my name from Tamriel. Do me this simple honor and I will fight at your side as your Grah-Zeymahzin, your Ally, and teach you my Thu'um.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
Just call your name in Tamriel? That's it?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Trivial in your mind, perhaps. For me, it would mean a great deal. I don't require an answer, Qahnaarin. Simply speak my name to the heavens when you feel the time is right.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
He teaches his thu'um. One can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Why do you call me ""Qahnaarin""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In my language, the Qahnaarin is the Vanquisher, the one who has bested a fellow dovah in battle.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
Fellow dovah? I am not a dragon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Forgive me, my instinct was to grant you this title. I am uncertain why. Perhaps one day it will become clear to both of us.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
How did you end up in the Soul Cairn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There was a time when I called Tamriel my home, but those days have long since passed. The dovah roamed the skies, vying for their small slices of territory that resulted in immense and ultimately fatal battles.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
Were you a part of all that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I was. But unlike some of my brethren, I sought solutions outside the norm in order to maintain my superiority. I began to explore what the dovah call ""Alok-Dilon,"" the ancient forbidden art that you call necromancy.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
So you sought the Soul Cairn for answers.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Ideal Masters assured me that my powers would be unmatched, that I could raise legions of the undead. In return, I was to serve them as a Keeper until the death of the one who calls herself Valerica.",CHARACTER,Durnehviir,male
They didn't tell you she was immortal.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Blind? Yes. I'm afraid so.,CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Can anything be done to help you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

PATHS REJOIN AT THIS POINT PATHS REJOIN AT THIS POINT,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Scattered across Tamriel are secluded locations known only as Ancestor Glades. There's one in Skyrim, in the Pine Forest. Performing the Ritual of the Ancestor Moth within the glade should provide the answers you seek.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"Explain this ""ritual.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It involves carefully removing the bark from the Canticle Tree which will in turn attract Ancestor Moths to you. Once enough of the moths are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to decipher the scrolls.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Carefully gather the bark? How?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the Ancestor Glade, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it...you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Do I need to read the scrolls in any particular order?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the prophecy.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
One can talk to Dexion about new options at this point.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How's a moth related to the Elder Scrolls?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, as I am sure you've figured out by now, it's no mere coincidence we are named ""Moth Priests."" The voice of the Ancestor Moth has always been an integral part of reading the Elder Scrolls.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"Moths barely make a sound, let alone speak.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, the moths don't literally read the scrolls...but they maintain a connection to ancient magic that allows the Moth Priests to decipher them. If you listen closely when you find the glade, you should be able to hear their song...a soft, harmonious trilling. It's through this ancestral chorus that the moths tap into a form of primal augur and become a conduit for deciphering the scrolls.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
How does that help the Moth Priest?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"By having the Ancestor Moths close to the Moth Priest, they can utilize the conduit and share the moth's augury. Only the most resilient of priests can do it this way...it takes years of practice to interpret the harmony.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Then how do I even stand a chance?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You've come this far, and you've found several Elder Scrolls. Whether you believe it or not, the scrolls have a mind of their own. If they didn't want you to find them, they wouldn't allow it. Because of this, I strongly believe you were meant to hear the ancestral chorus. Only one way to find out.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
What went wrong?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Deciphering one of the Elder Scrolls is nothing like reading a simple book. There is quite a bit of ritual and concentration required. It can take months or even years to complete a single scroll and even then, months to recover.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
Is it normal for Moth Priests to go blind?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sadly, yes. It is the inevitable fate we agree to pursue when reading the Elder Scrolls. It generally does not occur until a Moth Priest is in his latter years, but in my case I simply was not preparing myself properly.",CHARACTER,Dexion,male
"The player and Serana visit the glade, high in Falkreath's mountains. Inside is a bunch of loose foliage and crags.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

I am Knight-Paladin Gelebor. Welcome to the Great Chantry of Auri-El.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
This cave is a temple to Auriel?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Auriel, Auri-El, Alkosh, Akatosh...so many different names for the sovereign of the snow elves.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Snow elves? You're a Falmer?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I prefer snow elf. The name ""Falmer"" usually holds a negative meaning to most travelers. Those twisted creatures you call Falmer, I call the Betrayed.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
I imagine you know why we're here.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Of course. You're here for Auriel's Bow. Why else would you be here? I can help you get it, but first I must have your assistance.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What type of assistance do you need?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I need you to kill Arch-Curate Vyrthur...my brother.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Do I have a choice?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Absolutely. You could turn around and travel back from wherever you started empty handed, or you could assist me.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
How did you know?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"For the thousands of years I've served as the Chantry's sentinel, there hasn't been a single visitor here for any other reason. They request Auriel's Bow, and I request their assistance. It's been repeated so many times, I can't imagine it any other way.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
"Kill your brother, why?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The kinship between us is gone. I don't understand what he's become, but he's no longer the brother I once knew. It was the Betrayed... they did something to him, I just don't know why Auri-El would allow this to happen.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What exactly did the Betrayed do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
They swept into the Chantry without warning and began killing everyone without pause.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Didn't you fight back?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Chantry was a place of peaceful worship. I led a small group of paladins, but we were no match for the Betrayed's sheer numbers. They slaughtered everyone and stormed the Inner Sanctum where I believe they corrupted Vyrthur.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
You don't even know if he's alive.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"He's alive. I've seen him. But something's wrong. He never looks as though he's in pain or under duress. He just...stands there and watches, as though waiting.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Have you tried getting into the Inner Sanctum?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Leaving the wayshrines unguarded would be violating my sacred duty as a Knight-Paladin of Auriel. And an assault on the Betrayed guarding the Inner Sanctum would only end with my death.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Wayshrine?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, let me show you.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
"The strange monument nearby rises, revealing it was actually a small, shrunken pavilion with only a ceremonial basin inside.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, this is snow elf magic. Incredible.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
This structure is known as a wayshrine. They were used for meditation and for transport when the Chantry was a place of enlightenment. Prelates of these shrines were charged with teaching the mantras of Auri-El to our Initiates.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What's that basin in the center signify?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Once the Initiate completed his mantras, he'd dip a ceremonial ewer in the basin of the wayshrine's center and proceed to the next wayshrine.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
So these Initiates had to lug around a heavy pitcher of water. Marvelous. How long would they have to do that?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Well, once the Initiate's enlightenment was complete, he'd bring the ewer to the Chantry's Inner Sanctum. Pouring the contents of the ewer into the sacred basin of the Sanctum would allow him to enter for an audience with the Arch-Curate himself.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
All that just to end up dumping it out? Makes no sense to me.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
It's symbolic. I don't expect you to understand.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
"So, let's get this straight. We need to do all that nonsense to get into the temple, so we can kill your brother and claim Auriel's Bow?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"I know how it all sounds, but if there was another way I'd have done it long ago. The only way to get to my brother is by following in the Initiates' footsteps and traveling from wayshrine to wayshrine just as they did. The first lay at the end of Darkfall Passage, a cavern that represents the absence of enlightenment.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
How many more wayshrines are there?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There are five in total, spread far across the Chantry.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
These caves must be massive.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Caves? Oh, no. The Chantry encompasses far more than a few caves, as you'll soon discover. But before I send you on your way, you'll need the Initiate's Ewer.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
So I need to fill this at each wayshrine?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Once you've located a wayshrine, there will be spectral Prelate tending to it. They will allow you to draw the waters from the shrine's basin as if you've been enlightened.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
I'll be off then.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This may be the last time we're able to converse. If you have any questions before you leave, I suggest you ask them. Otherwise, all I can do now is grant you my hopes for a safe journey.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
If one inquires further to Gelebor...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Questions? I expected as much.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Who are the spectral Prelates you mentioned?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"They're ghosts of the snow elf priests that tended the wayshrines before being slaughtered by the Betrayed. Through the grace of Auri-El, they were restored to their spectral form to enable them to continue their duties.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
"Good, they should be able to help us.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm afraid in their current form, they still believe the Chantry to be an active center of worship. They won't respond to you in any way other than believing that you're an Initiate and you're undertaking the journey to the Inner Sanctum.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What is the Chantry of Auri-El?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is, or was, the epicenter for our religion. Most of the snow elf people worshipped Auri-El. The Chantry was constructed near the beginning of the First Era to provide a retreat to those that wished to become enlightened.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Most snow elves?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Our empire had temples to some of the other deities: Trinimac, Syrabane, Jephre and Phynaster rounded out the rest. But those temples paled in comparison to the glory of the Chantry and its wayshrines.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
The wayshrines are part of the Chantry then?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh yes. They were an important part of the process here. They represented the steps the Initiates took on the path to total enlightenment. Sadly, the magic used to construct these wonders were lost long before I arrived here.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Who were your people?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We were once a wealthy and prosperous society that occupied a portion of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we were constantly at war with the Nords who claimed the land as their ancestral home.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
It appears the Nords won.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In a manner of speaking. We had always maintained an uneasy alliance with the underground-dwelling dwarves, and when faced with extinction we turned to them for help. Surprisingly, they agreed to protect us but demanded a terrible price...the blinding of our race.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Everyone couldn't have possibly agreed to that.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There were splinter groups that resisted the agreement, and even some that sought alternate alliances. But when it was all said and done, those elves were either slaughtered, vanished or gave up and took the dwarves' bargain.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What turned your people into the Betrayed?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I've often asked myself the same question. The blinding of my race was supposedly accomplished with a toxin. Certainly not enough to devolve them into the sad and twisted beings they've become.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Why weren't the snow elves here afflicted?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The Chantry is quite isolated, so it took some time for word of the dwarves' offer to reach us here. By the time the compact had been completed, it was too late for us to even attempt to intervene.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Is that why you had retained your sight?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Correct. We only numbered perhaps a hundred at the time, so our presence remained a secret to the dwarves and the Nords. Ironically, our undoing came at the hands of our own people.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
You mean the Betrayed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Yes. They swarmed the Chantry in vast numbers until we were completely overrun. We never really stood a chance. I assume that the Arch-Curate was corrupted by them when they found a way to breach the Inner Sanctum.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
There were others here like you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Vyrthur and myself are the only two snow elves that remain.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
The snow elf magic opens a wayshrine portal to Darkfall Passage.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Well...that wasn't as unpleasant as I thought it would be. Kind of soothing, actually. I feel a little warmer, now.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
They start slaying the Falmer inhabitants.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Looks like these Falmer are here to stay. They must be who that priest was calling ""the Betrayed.""",CHARACTER,Serana,female
They come to a pull-chain door with a warrior's skeleton beside it.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hmmm. Pull chains and traps. Be careful here. Whatever's on the other side of this, the Falmer wanted to keep there.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"They find a Vale Sabre Cat beyond, one of the first new Chantry monsters. The caverns filled with strange animals.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This is the kind of thing I've been wanting to see. Makes everything worth it. I think that's another wayshrine up there. Here we go.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
They come upon a shrine and its ghostly prelate.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Illumination. Are you prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His enlightenment?",CHARACTER,Sidanyis,male

They continue on.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Is that another one of those wayshrines up there? I wonder where this one goes...,CHARACTER,Serana,female
They reach the next shrine.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You've reached the Wayshrine of Learning, Initiate. Are you prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His enlightenment?",CHARACTER,Celegriath,male
Yes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Auri-El bless you, child. For you are a step closer to the Inner Sanctum and everlasting wisdom. May Auri-El's warmth imbue your body with strength.",CHARACTER,Celegriath,male
"From the riverbank, they spot the next 'shrine on a far-off cliff.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"If we open that one, we'll be able to move around this valley a lot faster.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
They reach it.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You've arrived at the Wayshrine of Resolution. Are you prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His enlightenment?,CHARACTER,Nirilor,male
Yes.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"To reach the final shrine, Serana and her helper must travel the Falmer-choked a troll, and must put them down one and all.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Poor thing. I know it would have tried to kill us, but still...",CHARACTER,Serana,female
There's a rickety bridge nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Not the most solid construction. About what I'd expect from...creatures like this. Looks like they're better at making traps than they are at making bridges. A strange race, these Falmer.",CHARACTER,Serana,female

They enter the courtyard.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"That is a statue of Auriel, but it's using the older signs of his power. This temple must be ancient. The bow has to be in here.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"As the water is placed in the final basin, it opens the destination's door. Inside, the long-frozen corpses of snow elves can be seen.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
These Falmer are...they're frozen in the ice. I wonder how long they've been like this. And I thought the Soul Cairn was creepy.,CHARACTER,Serana,female

They corner him.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Enough, Vyrthur. Give us the bow!",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of Auri-El, girl. I had the ears of a god!",CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male

"Gelebor and his kind are easily manipulated fools. Look into my eyes, Serana. You tell me what I am.",CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male
You're...you're a vampire? But Auriel should have protected you...,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"The moment I was infected by one of my own Initiates, Auri-El turned his back on me. I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.",CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male
You want to take revenge...on a god?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on our world wasn't. All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own weapon, Auriel's Bow.",CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male
The blood of a vampire...Auriel's Bow... It...it was you? You created that prophecy?,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient...the blood of a pure vampire. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour.",CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male
"You were waiting...all this time for someone with my blood to come along. Well, too bad for you...I intend on keeping it. Let's see if your blood has any power to it!",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What trickery is this!,CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male
They kill him.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Farewell.,CHARACTER,Vyrthur,male
His death activates the final wayshrine. Gelebor steps out.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So, the deed has been done. The restoration of this wayshrine means that Vyrthur must be dead and the Betrayed no longer have control over him.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
The Betrayed weren't to blame.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
What? What are you talking about?,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
He was a vampire. He controlled them.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"A vampire? I see. That would explain much. Deep inside, it brings me joy that the Betrayed weren't to blame for what happened here.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Why?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Because that means there's still hope that they might one day shed their hatred and learn to believe in Auri-El once again. It's been a long time since I felt that way and it's been long overdue. My thanks, to both of you.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
You're welcome.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You risked everything to get Auri-El's Bow, and in return, you've restored the Chantry. I can't think of a more deserving champion to carry it than you. If you wish to learn more about the bow, or obtain Sunhallowed Arrows for it, I'd be more than happy to help. You've but to ask.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
One can inquire further.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Please, take the bow...it's yours.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What will happen to you now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Even with Vyrthur gone and the Inner Sanctum destroyed, my duty as a Knight-Paladin of Auri-El remains. I've been sworn to protect this vale and everything it represents until I die.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
And the wayshrines?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"For the time being, they will remain open. If remnants of our kind who escaped the betrayal at the hands of the dwarves exist out there, perhaps they will find this place one day.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What can you tell me about Auriel's Bow?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
The bow was said to be carried by Auri-El himself into battle against the forces of Lorkhan in ancient and mythic times. Its craftsmanship has no equal anywhere within Tamriel and possibly beyond.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What can it do?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The bow draws its power from Aetherius itself, channeling it through the sun. Therefore, when an arrow is loosed from the bow, it produces a magical effect very similar to being burned by fire.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Sounds powerful.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That's actually only a fraction of its potential. With Sunhallowed Arrows, you would be able to produce a much more spectacular effect... causing bursts of sunlight to envelop your foes. The sunbursts would certainly hurt anything, but is especially devastating to the undead.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Vyrthur said something about using blood?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Well, using an arrow with the bow that's been dipped in blood may cause it to function differently...corrupting its purpose. That's of course if you're foolish enough to try it.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
How do I obtain Sunhallowed Arrows?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I can actually assist you in that regard. If you were to bring me some good quality elven arrows, I could imbue them with the proper incantations and rituals.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
"Can you make me some Sunhallowed Arrows? • Absolutely. I can only do twenty at a time, so if you want the rest of your arrows blessed, let me know. • Absolutely. I can only do twenty at a time, but I see that won't be a problem in this case. • I'm afraid I'll need elven arrows if you want me to produce Sunhallowed Arrows, and it seems you're all out of them at the moment.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Can the Betrayed ever be cured?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I feel nothing but sympathy for the Betrayed, despite my actions against them. But I'm afraid that they're well beyond a cure at this point.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Why?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The twisted forms you've seen didn't occur overnight. It isn't a plague or a disease that ravaged our species. The dwarves may have stolen their sight, but it took many generations for them to become what they are today.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Then there's no hope for them.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Perhaps they'll never return to their former appearance, but over the centuries, I've noticed a rise in their intellect. If a line of communication could be established with them, maybe they can find peace. It's the only way they'll discover that they weren't always malignant...they were once a proud and prosperous race.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What will happen to the Chantry now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"While it would fill me with joy to see the Chantry back to its former glory, that time has long since passed. Now that my brother's dead, it's quite possibly I'm the last of our kind.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
Then I've contributed to your kind's extinction.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
There's no need for that kind of talk. I said it was possible. It's also quite possible that there are some other isolated conclaves of snow elves nestled elsewhere on Nirn. I'll also assume Vyrthur didn't exactly give you the option to stay your hand.,CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
What will you do then?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"For the time being I will remain here, on the overlook and continue trying to keep the Sanctum free of the Betrayed. You're always welcome to return here at any time, of course.",CHARACTER,Gelebor,male
The player claims the hallowed bow from the shrine.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"It's...not as shiny as I was expecting. Still, it's beautiful.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
What do we do now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"• Well, before we spoke to my mother in the Soul Cairn, I would have said we bring the bow to my father. But after everything with her...I don't think we can trust him. • I think we both know...it's time to face my father. If we don't, he'll keep chasing us for the rest of our lives.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Then we kill him, before he kills us.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I keep thinking that there's got to be another way, but he'll turn on us the moment he gets the chance.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
"If we do, he'll have to die.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I've been thinking about this for a long time. It's...it's not easy. But I don't think we have much of a choice.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"We have the bow, he'll listen to us.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Have you been paying attention to everything that's happened? He'll betray us the second our backs are turned.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Maybe we can reason with him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Have you been paying attention? It's obvious my father's well beyond reason.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
We should honor our agreement with him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Are you out of your mind? The moment you hand over the bow your usefulness ends. He'll kill you and then he'll take my blood for the damn prophecy.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Let's run as far from him as we can.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There's nowhere to run. And I'm certainly not moving in with my mother, if that's what you're implying.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
No. He has to die. We have no choice.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
No. This has to end here and now.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Then let's face him, together.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"• Thank you. Somehow I knew you'd understand. • If we head back to the castle and kick the front door in, we're going to be knee-deep in his friends. Let's head back to Isran and let him see what we've got first. I'm betting he'll lend us a sword or two.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
One can ask about Vyrthur's plan...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Vyrthur was saying something about vampire blood and the bow...,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
It sounds like...that's the last bit of the prophecy. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour can corrupt the bow.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"Can I use your blood, then?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Sure...do you have any arrows, though? They would have to be of elven quality, I'd guess.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
You're a Daughter of Coldharbour.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
So I am. I guess we could use my blood. Do you have any arrows? Elven arrows. I'm not going to just bleed on any old thing.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
I'd like to treat some arrows with your blood.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Let's just get this over with.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
"I think you'll need to find some arrows, first. Only elven ones will work for this, remember?",CHARACTER,Serana,female
I'm not going to take your blood right now.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh. All right, then.",CHARACTER,Serana,female
Are you ready to do this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I don't think you can ever be ready to kill your parent. I'm doing my best to not think of him as my father anymore.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
That's a good way to be thinking.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I hope so.,CHARACTER,Serana,female
Let me know if you need anything.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

• You're an insult to our kind. • Your kind is a blight on this world.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

I would never use Serana like that.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

The Argonians invaded Morrowind?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Quite a while ago, yes. They cut a bloody swath across most of the southern region of Morrowind. Nobody seems certain why it happened...an attempt at expansion, revenge for the enslavement of their people or perhaps both. Whatever the case may be, thousands of Dunmer needlessly lost their lives and many more were exiled from their homeland.",CHARACTER,Adril,male
Raven Rock is purely a Dunmer settlement?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Raven Rock started out as an Imperial settlement, but the Empire chose to abandon it just as my people were first setting foot here. They left the town in shambles...but when House Redoran took over, we turned it around and it became ours. And even if it's been a struggle to make this island livable, we're proud to call it home.

What does that mean?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm not sure, but it is fascinating, isn't it? Perhaps it has some relation to what's going on here. Quite unexpected. I'm afraid I can't give you any answers. But there are ruins of an ancient temple of Miraak's toward the center of the island. If I were you, I'd look there.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
What are these people doing?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

Save them from what?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am unsure. Something has taken control of most of the people of Solstheim. It makes them forget themselves, and work on these horrible creations that corrupt the Stones, the very land itself. My father Storn, our shaman, says Miraak has returned to Solstheim, but that is impossible.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
This Miraak tried to have me killed.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice

"His story is as old as Solstheim itself. He served the dragons before their fall from power, as most did. A priest in their order. But unlike most, he turned against them. He made his own path, and his actions cost him dearly. The stories say he sought to claim Solstheim for himself, and the dragons destroyed him for it.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
What is the Tree Stone?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It is an ancient stone of power, a connection to the All-Maker. It represents one of the aspects of nature, a part of the All-Maker's creation. There are other stones around Solstheim. I fear for what has happened to them...",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"Tell me of your people, the Skaal.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We have lived on Solstheim for many generations. Our people are tied to the land itself. We try to serve the All-Maker, to live in balance with nature, instead of exploiting it as others would.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
You're here by yourself?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"There are few of us left unaffected by this curse. My father Storn, the shaman, protects them in the village. I fashioned an amulet to guard me against whatever has taken hold of the Skaal, but it is the only one of its kind. If I cannot find a way to save them, there is no hope for our people.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"Together, they enter the lower temple.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Are you ready to help me now? We should not delay. We should check these rooms for supplies before heading further into the temple. We must be careful in these ruins. Traps can be anywhere, and there will likely be many. Miraak was trying to take power here, and protect himself in the process.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
They enter an ancient chamber with skeletons in hanging cages.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I do not wish to imagine what kinds of things happened in this chamber. Who were the poor souls trapped in these cages? What tortures did they suffer at Miraak's hands? Was it in service to the dragons, or for his own purposes? Look up there. I think I see something. The stairs are knocked out. I have no doubt you can find your way up. You never know, you may find something of value up there. I shall look around. We can proceed when you are ready.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
If one uses a support beam to reach the isolated ledge:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Impressive! Was it worth the effort?,CHARACTER,Frea,female
"The two head deeper into the crypt, setting of a guillotine trap.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I am not going down there. It would be foolish to attempt it. You have a much better chance to make it through these traps. I have no doubt that lever turns the blades off. I shall wait here for now.,CHARACTER,Frea,female
One shuts off the dangerous impediment.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Thank you. Miraak took great pains to make it difficult to reach him, it seems. Let us hope that is the last of these traps.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
The continue toward the sanctum.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The evil of this place must be rooted out. I do not know what it is Miraak learned that gave him reason to turn on his masters. But his path seems to have been a cruel one. I wonder if we will find some answers to what happened so long ago.,CHARACTER,Frea,female
After awhile...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"How much deeper can this be? I had been told that Miraak's power was great, but to have built so large a temple... It cannot be much further now. I feel it in my bones.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"After encountering a Word Wall, the chamber shakes.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Something feels wrong. Brace yourself!,CHARACTER,Frea,female
"They kill the escaping draugr and find a key, leading into a hidden section of the temple.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Dead end? Impossible. There must be something more! Look around. I will let you know if I find anything in the dining area.,CHARACTER,Frea,female
The player uses a weird lever.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I knew it! A secret passage in the dining area just opened up. This must be it. Let us move quickly.,CHARACTER,Frea,female
The room they find has gated stairways and grotesque statues.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I wonder if there is something here that tells the story of Miraak... Nothing but ruined books. I do not recognize this statuary. We passed by a few of them earlier, but they are becoming more frequent as we get further in. I do not like this place. It almost looks as if these statues will come to life at any moment. It looks like there is only one way to proceed. I leave the honor of pulling that handle to you. I do not want to put my hand anywhere near the mouth of that statue.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
They continue downward.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
It is eerily quiet. I do not suspect that will be the case the further we go. Be on your guard.,CHARACTER,Frea,female
Deep in the heart of the temple is a massive statue-adorned stairway. The large book.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"There are dark magics at work here. Ready yourself. This book... It seems wrong, somehow. Here, yet...not. It may be what we seek.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"As one begins to read the Black Book, a mass of tentacles drags one into a floating creatures. A subservient dragon seems to be nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The time comes soon when... What?,CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"He zaps the player, preventing them from attacking.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Who are you to dare set foot here? Ah... You are Dragonborn. I can feel it. And yet... You have done little beyond killing a few dragons. You have no idea of the true power a Dragonborn can wield! Mul...Qah Diiv! This realm is beyond you. You have no power here. And it is only a matter of time before Solstheim is also mine. I already control the minds of its people. Soon they will finish building my temple, and I can return home. She can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel.",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"The creatures delay the player, letting Miraak fly away on the dragon. One is the forcefully ejected from the book.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"What happened to you? You read the book and then... It seemed as though you were not really here. I could see you, but also see through you!",CHARACTER,Frea,female
I'm not really sure. I saw Miraak on a dragon.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Where? Where is he? Can we reach him? Can we kill him?,CHARACTER,Frea,female
"Somehow, reading this book took me to where he was.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"This is a dangerous thing, then. We should return to my village, and show this to my father. Perhaps Storn can make sense of what is going on. Come, there looks to be a way out through here.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
Everyone escapes out into the fresh air. The Wind Stone's glow is nearby.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You see that green light? That comes from the Wind Stone, where my people work against their will. They must be freed soon. My village is just ahead. Storn has used his magic to raise a barrier around it, protecting the few of us left. That the barrier is still there is a good sign.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"They reach the small village. In its center, a few people are meditating, and their energies are creating an overhead wind barrier.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Father! I have returned! There is yet hope!,CHARACTER,Frea,female
Frea! What news do you bring? Is there a way to free our people?,CHARACTER,Storn,male
"No, but I have brought someone who has seen things... He has confirmed that Miraak is the one behind the suffering of our people.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
I feared that it would be so.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
But how is that possible? After all this time...,CHARACTER,Frea,female
I fear there is much we do not yet know.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
"Please, tell Storn what has happened.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"So, you have seen things, yes? My magic grows weak, and so does the barrier around our village. Time is short. Tell me what you know.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
I've seen Miraak.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Really? How?,CHARACTER,Storn,male
Miraak is behind what's happening to your people.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
How do you know this?,CHARACTER,Storn,male
"I read a book in Miraak's temple, and went somewhere. Miraak was there.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"The legends speak of that place. Terrible battles fought at the temple. The dragons burning it to the ground in rage. They speak also of something worse than dragons buried within. Difficult to imagine, but if true... It means what I feared has come to pass. Miraak was never truly gone, and now has returned. If you could go to this place and see him... Are you like Miraak? Are you Dragonborn?",CHARACTER,Storn,male
I am indeed Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then perhaps you are connected with him. The old tales say that he, too, was Dragonborn.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
Miraak did claim to be Dragonborn.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"That is what the stories say. You are Dragonborn as well, then. Perhaps you are connected.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
What does it mean if we're both Dragonborn?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am unsure. It may mean that you could save us, or it may mean that you could bring about our destruction. But our time is running out. The few of us left free of control cannot protect ourselves for much longer. You must go to Saering's Watch. Learn there the Word Miraak learned long ago, and use that knowledge on the Wind Stone. You may be able to break the hold on our people there, and free them from control.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
What do you know about Miraak?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Much of what was known has been lost to the ages. He was Dragonborn, and yet he served the dragons. A priest in their order, highly esteemed and very powerful. Then he turned against them, becoming something they feared. He was defeated long ago, but it seems he was never destroyed.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
"What do you mean, ""free your people from control?""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Some dark influence wields power over them, forces them to forget themselves and act against their nature. At first it was only during the night, but now every moment is spent building some strange shrine around the Wind Stone. I believe if the shrine can be destroyed, the Skaal will be free once more.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
Why do I need to learn a Word of Power?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Miraak is behind what's happening to our village, and so the knowledge he has gained as Dragonborn is at the heart of it. You are Dragonborn as well. You too can wield this power, perhaps to a better end. All-Maker shelter you.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
"After getting part of the Bend Will Shout at the destination, one returns to appears for everyone to neutralize. Everyone returns to the village.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The air is different. We are safe, which means you have succeeded.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
Your people are free.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"So it is. You have proven yourself an ally to the Skaal, and so the Skaal shall be allies to you.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
What do we do now?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you have released the Wind Stone and broken the hold on my people, perhaps you can do the same for the rest of Solstheim. I doubt it will fully stop whatever Miraak is doing, but it may slow his progress.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
That's not enough. I need to stop Miraak now.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I cannot help with that. None here can. You will need the knowledge Miraak himself learned. You will need to learn more about this Black Book.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
"Tell me more about this book, then.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Miraak had this? This does not look like something of the Dragon cult. It is a dark thing, unnatural. I would have nothing to do with it. But the Dark Elf Wizard, Neloth... He came to us sometime ago, asking about the Black Books. I believe he knows a great deal about them. Perhaps too much. Seek him to the south. Be cautious, Dragonborn. There is something else at work here.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
To the south is a gigantic house made from a Morrowind mushroom -- Neloth's spellcasting.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Why are you out here? Aren't you supposed to be in the tower assisting Master Neloth?,CHARACTER,Varona,female
"Why won't this summoning work? If you must know, I'm trying to get this Ash Guardian spell to work. Now let me concentrate. Besides, shouldn't you be worrying about the damage to the tower?",CHARACTER,Talvas Fathryon,male
"Master Neloth has tasked Elynea with repairing the tower. Why aren't you doing this in the lab, where it would be safer for all of us?",CHARACTER,Varona,female
"The, uh...the lab is too small. Also, I need the ashy soil. Master Neloth knows what I'm doing. No need to bother him about it though. He's quite busy at the moment",CHARACTER,Talvas Fathryon,male
It's on your head if something goes wrong. Just let me get back inside first.,CHARACTER,Varona,female
No Ash Guardian. Maybe the book has something.,CHARACTER,Talvas Fathryon,male
She notices the player is approaching.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
We don't get many visitors. Is there something you need?,CHARACTER,Varona,female
What is this place?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Tel Mithryn. It's the home of Master Neloth. You may have heard of him. He's a famous Telvanni wizard.,CHARACTER,Varona,female
He lives in a giant mushroom?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"In Morrowind, the Telvanni grow buildings from special fungus spores. Master Neloth grew one here to be his home. Don't ask me how.",CHARACTER,Varona,female
Are you one of Neloth's apprentices?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No. Talvas is his apprentice. I'm his steward. I manage the day to day affairs of Tel Mithryn.,CHARACTER,Varona,female
Who else lives here?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Talvas is Master Neloth's apprentice. If you are interested in spells, he might be willing to sell you some. Elynea is our alchemist. She specializes in mushrooms and other types of fungus. Ulves runs the kitchens.",CHARACTER,Varona,female
One goes up to visit the famous wizard in the largest mushroom tower.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You again? Didn't I see you in Raven Rock?,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
I hear you know where to find Black Books.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
You refer to the tomes of esoteric knowledge that old Hermaeus Mora has scattered throughout the world? Is this somehow connected to your search for Miraak?,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
I found a Black Book. I need to find more.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Found one? Yes, and you read it, too, didn't you? Don't try to deny it, you've got the look. I can see it now. Dangerous knowledge is still knowledge and therefore useful. Usually turns out to be the most useful, in my experience.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
The Black Books have something to do with Hermaeus Mora?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You didn't know? Hmm, I thought it was obvious. Hermaeus Mora has always tried to seduce mortals into his service with the lure of forbidden knowledge. Where the Black Books actually came from...no one really knows. Some appear to have been written far in the past, others might be from the future. Apparently time is more malleable if you're the Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Who is Hermaeus Mora?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"If you have to ask that, you'd probably be best leaving his books to wiser heads than yours. Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for the prince of knowledge and fate. Many scholars and loremasters have been ensnared by the lure of learning secrets that only Hermaeus Mora possesses. But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in their endless search though the infinite halls of Apocrypha.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
I have to know what Miraak knows if I want to stop him.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Now that is a dangerous path indeed. Hermaeus Mora gives nothing away for free. You may end up like Miraak, of course. Two power-mad Dragonborn. It could be very interesting.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Do you know where I can find another Black Book?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Oh yes. They're not hard to locate once you know how to look for them. I have one here that I've been using to locate more.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
You have a Black Book?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Yes. I haven't been idle while this fascinating madness engulfed Solstheim. But my book isn't what you're looking for. I'm quite sure it's unconnected with this Miraak. But I do know where to find a Black Book that can help you.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
So you know where to find this Black Book? The one connected with Miraak?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I do. I haven't been able to get it, though. But maybe together we can unlock the secrets the Dwemer left behind.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
The Dwemer? What do they have to do with this?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Forbidden knowledge was somewhat of a specialty of the dwarves, eh? You don't think they would just leave it alone, do you?",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Just tell me where the book is and I'll go get it.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I'm afraid it isn't that simple. If it was, I would have the book already. It seems the ancient Dwemer discovered this book and took it to study. I found their ""reading room"" in the ruins of Nchardak. The book is there, but it's sealed in a protective case which I wasn't able to open. But perhaps the two of us together will be able to get at the book. To Nchardak, then. Follow me.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Why won't the book you have here help me?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Oh, it is clearly not associated with the same power that has overtaken the island. And I'm not talking about Hermaeus Mora. These Black Books are all his, of course. No, what you're looking for is a specific book. Presumably because Miraak's power derives from it.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Neloth takes the player to the seaside Dwemer ruins.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The Dwemer certainly know how to build for the ages. These towers have outlasted their creators by millenia. The book is housed inside that dome. I'll need to unlock the door for us. Let's get on with it.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Reaver bandits attack.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I had to clean out the riff-raff last time I was here, too. Where do they come from?",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
They finally slay the outdoor assailants and approach the locked entrance.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The Dwemer of Nchardak appear to have been fond of these control pedestals. Luckily I found a cube to operate it inside on my last visit. I sealed the door when I left to keep out ignorant meddlers. Let me unlock it. The book is just inside.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"The two visit inside. The target item is visible in the floor, under a thick protective cover.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You can see the book right there. So tantalizingly close...but trust me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if it could. No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it. As you'll see, that's easier said than done. This way to the boilers. Follow me.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"The elevator takes them into the desolate, flooded boiler room.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"The last time I was here, I only explored a small portion of the ruins. I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential for this kind of dirty, dangerous work. Nchardak. The ""City of a Hundred Towers"". In its day, it was the largest of the great Dwemer Archives, and perhaps the most advanced. In the old stories, when the Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer submerged the entire city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up. I have my doubts. But the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now...reduced to this. As you can see, most of the lower levels of the city are flooded. But it isn't hopeless -- the old Dwemer pumps still seem to work. Watch.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"He uses a control pedestal, draining part of the room.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"But the pumps only operate when a cube is in the pedestal. And unfortunately, I only have one cube. These four boilers provide steam to the room upstairs. They're shut down, but they still respond to the control cubes. So, if we can find four more cubes, we can turn these boilers back on and restore steam power to the room upstairs. Then I should be able to open the book's protective case. Bring that cube. We'll need it.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
One takes the cube and visits Neloth at an old Dwemer control panel.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Yes...here we are. This device shows the location of four more cubes in this section of the city. It looks like most of the cubes were moved to the lower levels; perhaps to try to control the flooding before the city was abandoned. Interesting. That would suggest that the city must have originally sunk during the first cataclysm of Red Mountain. Or that the Dwemer's servitors continued to try to preserve the city after their creators' disappearance.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
He stops at a door.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Three of the cubes are through here. This seems like a sensible place to start. You should be able to unseal this door with the control cube I gave you.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
They enter the adjacent workshop. A cube is sitting a few steps away.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I hope the rest of the cubes arethis easy to find. Although knowing the Dwemer, I rather doubt it.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"A long, half-flooded chamber is nearby.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"These must be the ""Great Workshops of Nchardak"". Impressive even in ruins. In the city's days of glory, it was reputed to be able to assemble a complete automaton in a single day. Much of the Dwemer army at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here. It looks like we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"Using the cubes, the room is drained.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Ah, good. Now we can see if we can find a way to get that next cube.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Some Centurions come to life.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
There seems to be an inexhaustible suply of these Dwemer contraptions.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
They claim a third cube still in use.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Unfortunately, each cube we retrieve shuts down the corresponding pumps, raising the water level. We'll have to be careful.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"They end up reflooding the room, gaining access to a broken passage.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Let's see where this leads. With the water level this high, we can swim right across the collapsed part of the passage and reach the other side.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"Soon after, they find another cube.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes. Assuming you haven't dropped any anywhere.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
They return to the first area of the boilery.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You'll need to lower the water level before we can proceed any further.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"Soon, it's time to visit the aqueduct.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The last cube is somewhere in here. I hope it won't require more swimming around in this filth. I'd guess that must be the pump activator up there. But how to reach it? We'll need to get all three of these bridges down in order to reach the pump control.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
The player fiddles with the cube controls.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
That's it! Don't touch anything else. Quickly now.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
They kill some automatons.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What a mess. I'm getting tired of wading around in this muck. I have an idea. I'll wait here and retrieve this cube once you find the last one we need. Good luck!,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"Nearby, one retrieves the last cube from its booby-trapped pedestal.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Do you have the cube? Good, good! Then I'll take this cube and we can be on our way. Watch out. The water's rising even higher with both pumps shut down. That was easier than I expected. I'm glad you were here to do all the hard work. With the cube I retrieved from the pumping pedestal, we should now have five cubes -- exactly what we need. Now we can finally see about getting those boilers started.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"For the last time, everyone returns to Nchardak's boilery.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You'll need the cube I picked up to start all the boilers. Here, I picked this up this cube for you.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
All boilers are put back in action.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"That seems to have done it. Good. It took longer than I'd hoped, but at least it's finally done. Look out, another Steam Centurion!",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
They kill the final foe.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam. If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Everyone travels upstairs.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Yes, it worked! The steam is flowing. Now it should be as simple as... That should do it.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
The case recedes and the book rises up into plain view.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"At last. I hope it was worth it. Please...be my guest. You deserve the first look. Besides, it could be very dangerous. These books are known to drive many people insane.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
The player opens Nchardak's Black Book...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Oh good. Be sure to say hello to Hermaeus Mora for me, if you see him.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"...and is warped back to Hermaeus Mora's plane of Oblivion, filled with black previously completed his ""Discerning the Transmundane"" quest.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• So, another seeker after knowledge enters my realm. • I know you, champion. The Oghma Infinium was only the beginning.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"This is Apocrypha, where all knowledge is hoarded.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"• Perhaps you will prove clever enough to uncover the secrets hidden here. If so, welcome. Perhaps you are a fool or a coward. If so, you are in peril. Read your book again and escape before Apocrypha claims you forever. • Sate your thirst for knowledge in the endless stacks of my library. If you tire of your search, read your book again to return to your mortal life. For a time. The lure of Apocrypha will call you back. It is your fate.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
The player navigates the book's chapters to reach the end.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"• All seekers of knowledge come to me, sooner or later. • Well done, my champion. Your journey towards enlightenment has finally lead you here, to my realm, as I knew it would.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
Who are you?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I am Hermaeus Mora, the Gardener of Men, knower of the unknown, master of fates. You stand in my realm, mortal.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
What do you want of me? / What do you want of me this time?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You have entered my realm. You have sought out the forbidden knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are Dragonborn, like Miraak before you. A seeker of knowledge and power.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"What do you want me of this time, my lord?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Your progress since obtaining my Oghma Infinium has been rapid. And now, I find you here, following in my servant Miraak's footsteps. You also are Dragonborn. You also seek how to bend the world to your will.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"Don't worry, I was just leaving.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. Not yet. I have watched your progress through my realm with growing interest. You are following in the footsteps of my servant, Miraak. Like him, you are Dragonborn, and seek the power that is your birthright.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"Yes, I came here to learn Miraak's secrets.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
All that he knows he learned from me.,CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"I won't serve you, monster. I just want to defeat Miraak.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You will serve me, willing or not. All who seek after the secrets of the world are my servants.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
I don't need your help. I'll learn Miraak's secrets on my own.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"No. Look around you. You have done nothing here on your own. You could spend a hundred lifetimes searching my library, and you will never find what you seek. I know what you want: to use your power as Dragonborn to bend the world to your will. Here then is the knowledge you need, although you did not know you needed it. The second Word of Power. Use it to bend the will of mortals to your purpose. But this is not enough. Miraak knows the final Word of Power. Without that, you cannot hope to surpass him. Miraak served me well, and was rewarded. I can grant you the same power as he wields, but all knowledge has its price.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
So what's your price for the final Word of Power?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Knowledge for knowledge.,CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"Tell me what you want, my lord, and I will bring it to you.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You please me, champion. Your loyalty will be richly rewarded. The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my library.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
I will talk to the Skaal and bring you their secrets.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I know you will. And then I will give you the knowledge that you seek.,CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"I will do as you command, my lord.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, I know. And then Miraak's power will be yours as well.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
What if the Skaal refuse to give up their secrets?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My servant Miraak would have found a way to bring me what I want. So will you, if you wish to surpass him.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"How do I know I can trust you, demon?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. Bring me what I want, and I will give you what you seek.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
Why do I need this Word of Power to defeat Miraak?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Even dragons submit to Miraak's Voice. Without that power, you cannot face him. So say I, Hermaeus Mora, master of the tides of Fate.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
Isn't Miraak your ally? Why help me defeat him?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
He has served me long and well. But he grows restless under my guidance. His desire to return to your world will spread my influence more widely. But it will also set him free from my direct control. It may be time to replace him with a more loyal servant. One who still appreciates the gifts that I have to offer. Send the Skaal shaman to me. He holds the secrets that will be mine.,CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"The player finally exits the book, being transported back to Nchardak.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What happened? What did you see? Different people have very different experiences when reading these books.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
I talked to Hermaeus Mora.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"You're still surprisingly sane, too. What did he have to say? He must have wanted something from you.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
I learned the second Word of the Bend Will Shout.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
No wonder the Dwemer were so interested in that book. It was indeed one that Miraak used to advance his power as Dragonborn. But I assume there's some bad news. It would be unlike Hermaeus Mora to allow anyone to gain such knowledge without exacting a price.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"He wants the ""secrets of the Skaal"" in exchange for teaching me the third Word.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Hmph. What secrets could they have worth keeping from old Mora? Sounds like a bargain to me. Hermaeus Mora learns some fascinating new ways to skin a horker, and you become the second most powerful Dragonborn that ever lived. Well, that gives me a lot to think about. I need to get back to Tel Mithryn. I have some ideas about how to locate more of these Black Books...",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
"With the sojourn over, the player exits outside, finding a dragon waiting.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"When Miraak returns, all will bow before him!",CHARACTER,Krosulhah,male
"They kill the dragon, but a projection of Miraak appears, taking the soul.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
This dragon's soul belongs to me. One step closer to my return.,CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"After, it's back to Skaal Village to find Storn.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I spoke to Hermaeus Mora. He asked for the ""secrets of the Skaal.""",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Hermaeus Mora...old Herma-Mora himself. So he is the source of Miraak's power. Of course. We have many tales of Herma-Mora trying to trick us into giving up our secrets to him. And now he comes again for what we have long kept from him.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
He said that's the only way he'll teach me the final Word of Miraak's Shout.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
So it falls to me to be the one to give up our secrets to our ancient enemy. I do not know if I have the strength to face him. The Tree Stone is still corrupted...the land is still out of balance. But with the other five restored...it may be enough. It will have to be.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
You mean you'll give him what he wants?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes. The Skaal also tell of the day when we must finally give up our secrets. When Herma-Mora finally wins. As shaman, it is my duty to guard these secrets, but also to decide when it is necessary to give them up. I believe that time is now. If I am wrong, may my ancestors forgive me. Give me the book. I will read it, and speak to old Herma-Mora myself. I will make sure he lives up to his part of the bargain.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
"What are the ""secrets of the Skall""?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Ancient lore, handed down from shaman to shaman since the All-Maker first gave Solstheim to the Skaal. How to talk to the wind, how to listen to the earth -- these are our secrets. Nothing of power or mastery.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
Why would Hermaeus Mora want your secrets?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"We know him as Herma-Mora, the Demon of Knowledge. It is in his nature to hoard secrets for himself. Their value to him is of no consequence. The very fact that the Skaal have kept knowledge from him has merely increased his desire to have it.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
Herma-Mora? Why do you call him that?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That is our name for him -- the Demon of Knowledge. He has always been our enemy.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
I hope you know what you're doing. (Give book),CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
That is my hope as well. I am trusting that you will make this sacrifice worthwhile.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
"Father, you must not do this. That book is...wrong. Evil. Against everything that you have taught me my whole life.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"I must, Frea. It is the only way to free Solstheim forever from Miraak's shadow. There comes a time when everything must change. Nothing that lives remains the same forever. Do not fear for me, my daughter. This is the destiny that the All-Maker has laid out for me.",CHARACTER,Storn,male
"I stand beside you, father, as always.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
I am ready for whatever the foul master of this book has in store for me.,CHARACTER,Storn,male
He opens the book; dark tendrils dig into his mind as Herma-Mora manifests.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"At last, the Skaal yield up their secrets to me.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"Father! No, stop!",CHARACTER,Frea,female
You...liar...gah!...I won't...not...for you...,CHARACTER,Storn,male
Do something!,CHARACTER,Frea,female
"Dragonborn, you have delivered me the gift I requested. In return, I keep my promise, as befits a Prince of Oblivion: I give you the Word of Power that you need to challenge Miraak. You will be either a worthy opponent or his successor, as the tides of fate decree.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
Nooo...,CHARACTER,Storn,male
"Storn crumples to the floor, dead. Herma-Mora disappears.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Father! What have you done? Go. My father sacrificed himself so that you could destroy Miraak and lift his master's shadow from the land. Go, then. Kill Miraak. Do not fail.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
The other Skaal come to pay their respects at the body.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Goodbye, old friend. We will miss you, but do not worry. Frea will guide us well, thanks to you.",CHARACTER,Fanari Strong-Voice,female
"We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider. Walk with the All-Maker.",CHARACTER,Edla,female
Frea...I'm sorry.,CHARACTER,Deor,male
"It can't be...please, All-Maker, send him back to us...",CHARACTER,Aeta,female
May the All-Maker guide your soul to the next life.,CHARACTER,Finna,female
Frea...what happened? What was that thing? I thought the village was safe now.,CHARACTER,Nikulas,male
"Return to the All-Maker, old one. The Skaal will never forget your sacrifice.",CHARACTER,Wulf Wild-Blood,male
"I don't really understand what you did, but I trust you did it for the good of the village. So...thank you.",CHARACTER,Morwen,female
"By the gods...I've never seen anything like it...I, uh...I don't think this will go in my book.",CHARACTER,Tharstan,male
"With the full Thu'um attained, one reads the Waking Dreams book to reenter Bend Will Shout.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Hail, thuri. Your thu'um has the mastery. Climb aboard and I will carry you to Miraak.",CHARACTER,Sahrotaar,male
"The player hangs on as Sahrotaar heads for a distant, isolated tower.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Beware. Miraak is strong. He knew you would come here.,CHARACTER,Sahrotaar,male
They land on the tower. The enemy Dragonborn is patiently waiting.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Sahrotaar, are you so easily swayed?",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
Sahrotaar talks again.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"No. Not yet. We should greet our guest first. And so the First Dragonborn meets the Last Dragonborn at the summit of Apocrypha. No doubt just as Hermaeus Mora intended. He is a fickle master, you know. But now I will be free of him. My time in Apocrypha is over. You are here in your full power, and thus subject to my full power. You will die. And with the power of your soul, I will return to Solstheim and be master of my own fate once again. Kruziikrel! Relonikiv! Now!",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"Miraak's other two dragons appear, and Sahrotaar flies off to fight them.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"So easily you betray me, after all these years.",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"When weakened, Miraak calls to his dragon...",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Kruziikrel, ziil los dii du!",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
...and steals its soul when it lands. He repeats this for his other helper.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Relonikiv, ziil los dii du!",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
He regains his health yet again.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Fate decreed that you had to die so that I could win my freedom.,CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"Finally, he calls his final dragon to its demise.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Sahrotaar, ziil los dii du!",CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"Finally, after all Miraak's embarrassing shenanigans, Hermaeus Mora stops him mid-teleport and raises him into the air.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Did you think to escape me, Miraak? You can hide nothing from me here. No matter. I have found a new Dragonborn to serve me.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
May he be rewarded for her service as I am!,CHARACTER,Miraak,male
"Herma-Mora's tentacle impales him, slaying him permanently.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Miraak harbored fantasies of rebellion against me. Learn from his example. Serve me faithfully, and you will continue to be richly rewarded.",CHARACTER,Hermaeus,male
"With the threat to Solstheim averted, the player returns triumphant. That ends the questline properly. If one revisits Skaal Village:",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I can feel it. The Tree Stone is free again. The Oneness of the land is is restored. Does that mean...is it over? Is Miraak defeated?,CHARACTER,Frea,female
It's over. Miraak is dead.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
Then my father's sacrifice...it was not in vain. He died to free us. Tell me...was it the only way? Did he need to die?,CHARACTER,Frea,female
I couldn't have defeated Miraak without Storn's help.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Then...it was the All-Maker's will, as he said. I know I should not doubt it. But it is good to hear, all the same. Thank you.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"Hermaeus Mora killed Storn, remember. Not Miraak.",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I know. The Skaal will not forget this. Storn's death will become another of the many tales of Herma-Mora's treachery.,CHARACTER,Frea,female
Hermaeus Mora wouldn't have helped me without Storn's sacrifice.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Yes, his ""help"" which did not require him to kill my father. Such is the way of Herma-Mora, the eternal enemy of the Skaal.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
Storn didn't die for nothing. Miraak will never threaten Solstheim again.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Thank you. Whatever your other reasons for acting, you have done the Skaal a great service. We will not forget what you've done.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
I killed Miraak. But Hermaeus Mora is still out there.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"It was Miraak who threatened Solstheim. With him gone, Herma-Mora has been foiled once again. Tell me, though...my father's death...was it necessary? Was there no other way to destroy Miraak? One more thing, Skaal-friend, if you will. I know it is not my place, but...may I offer a word of advice...of warning?",CHARACTER,Frea,female
"Sure, what is it?",CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"As shaman of the Skaal, I am charged with the spiritual well-being of my people. While you are not of the Skaal, you are Skall-friend, and so I give you this warning. Herma-Mora forced you to serve him in order to defeat Miraak. Do not let him lure you further down that path. The All-Maker made you Dragonborn for a higher purpose. Do not forget that. Walk with the All-Maker, Skaal-friend.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
I don't need your advice.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"I understand. Walk with the All-Maker, Dragonborn.",CHARACTER,Frea,female
If one revisits Neloth to update him about the goings-on:,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Hold still. Let me get a good look at you.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
What are you looking for?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Incipient madness. Loss of self-awareness. Black spots in the whites of the eyes. Any of the documented indications of Hermaeus Mora's permanent influence. Hmm, no, you look fine. Well, at least no different than when I first saw you.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
Don't you want to know what happened with Miraak?,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
"Who? Oh him. Well, I assume you killed him. Or Hermaeus Mora turned on him when you looked like the winning bet. Or a bit of both.",CHARACTER,Neloth,male
You don't need to worry about me.,CHARACTER,Dragonborn,playerChoice
I wasn't worried. Just interested. I don't get to observe first-hand many people who've spoken to Hermaeus Mora.,CHARACTER,Neloth,male
