Bring my sister to me. Her name is Serah.,CHARACTER,Lightning,female
Okay.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
The two stare down at a portal.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You'll need to use the portal. Your time-gazing friend should have told you how it works.,CHARACTER,Lightning,female
"That's a gate... ? But, why me?",CHARACTER,Noel,male

Even though it couldn't possibly be true. It seems like only yesterday. The smile on Lightning's face when she gave her blessing for Snow and me to get married. But I'm the only one who ever remembered that. No one believes. It's just a dream, they say, from when I slept in the crystal. An illusion. They say my sister is gone.

"You got that right. Look at this stuff! Ever since that rock came down, we've been seein' all kinds of aberrations.",CHARACTER,Maqui,male
Do you have any idea what's happening?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Not the slightest clue. Some spots seem to have sped forward centuries. But other parts haven't changed at all...,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
So these areas are from different timelines. Realities blending together? Like two ages overlapping. That about right?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Right! It's exactly like that!,CHARACTER,Maqui,male

Wait. What happened to Cocoon? It's not there.,CHARACTER,Serah,female

"Well, it's 3 AF. So, that was three years ago.",CHARACTER,Serah,female

You see? It's a Time Gate.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Wow.,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
"Whaddya mean, 'Time Gate'?",CHARACTER,Gadot,male
What the...,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
It's like a portal. Lightning is in a place called Valhalla. She's waiting on the other side.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"(narrating) I couldn't turn my eyes away. I knew the answer lay beyond that gate. The answer to my doubts and dreams. On the broad plain beneath Cocoon, my sister once celebrated my marriage to Snow. I remember her smile like it was yesterday. But sometime, when I wasn't looking, she disappeared. She was gone as if she'd never been there in the first place. Lightning, are you out there? Did I dream that day on Pulse, or did it really happen? Noel says he can find you. But is he telling the truth?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"The scene changes to show Serah, Noel and the members of NORA talking back at the house.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Noel's world was a terrible place where Cocoon did not exist. He had traveled back in time to change that bleak future. Or so he told us.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Listen, when different eras overlap, all kinds of crazy stuff happens. Objects from different times get mixed up. If you want to open a gate and travel through time... ... you have to find one of those objects. They're called artefacts.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Artefacts?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
The keys to the future.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Hmm.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"They're anachronisms, relics of a different world. Basically, things that don't belong in your time. If we can find one, we might be able to use it to open the gate. Then we could cross time and travel to Lightning's world.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"(narrating) Could Noel be telling the truth? Beyond that gate, in a place called Valhalla... ... is Lightning alive and waiting for me? Can I dare to hope again, after all this time? Oh, how I want to believe. I want my sister back! (The scene fades to black and then Serah starts narrating again.) So much happened the night the meteorite fell. We all had a lot to think about. I wonder if anyone slept. (She is shown rising and stretching.) Good morning.",CHARACTER,Serah,female

Let you run off with some con artist? I'd beat him half to death first.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male

Gotta be careful out there. Still a lot of nasties roamin' around.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male
"This Noel guy, what's he after?",CHARACTER,Gadot,male
Still a bit early for patrols.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male
"So, you're just taking him at his word? He says he's from the future, but where's the proof?",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
I guess you're right. It's just hard after I had that dream about Lightning. You know what I mean?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Noel doesn't seem to be a bad guy. Still...,CHARACTER,Yuj,male
"We're just trying to look out for you, you know?",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
I wonder what Snow would do.,CHARACTER,Yuj,male
"You were up late last night, Maqui. Big project?",CHARACTER,Serah,female

Better start getting lunch ready.,CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
"If you want to believe what Noel says, that's your decision.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
The guys have been acting kinda weird. Wonder what they're up to.,CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
She can talk with Noel.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Let's meet outside once you're ready. Okay?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
I slept great. Just like being at home.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
This's a nice place. Almost a shame to leave it behind.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
We've got to get looking for that artefact.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Serah exits the house and a cutscene begins. Noel comes running up behind her.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Serah, wait up for me.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"All this talk about artefacts and gates and time travel... To be honest, I don't know if I'm ready to believe it.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Serah. There's still so much I don't understand myself. If we can actually find an artefact, then I'll know what I've been saying is true. And once we open the gate, you'll be able to put some of your doubts to rest as well. So, what do you think? Will you search for the answers with me?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Serah sighs and a tutorial screen is presented regarding using the moogle's bobble to find special items and treasures. After clearing the screen, playable control is returned to Serah.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

She can talk with him.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'll answer as best I can.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Live Trigger Noel wants to search for an 'artefact' to open a 'gate.' Maybe I should find out more.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Player chooses Triangle - What's with the moogle?,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Is this really a moogle?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"He sure looks like one, but to be honest, I really don't know. Lightning just called him a 'good luck charm.'",CHARACTER,Noel,male
I remember that part. That's what she said in the dream I had.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
You saw the future? But that means...,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Player chooses Triangle - Tell me about the people you lived with.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Noel, tell me about the people you lived with.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
They were an ancient nomadic tribe. They wandered Gran Pulse for centuries. They were long before Cocoon was created.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
They were the hidden tribe of Pulse.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yes, that's what they call them. But they did have some contact with people who left Cocoon.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Player chooses Circle - What's this 'gate'?,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Player chooses X - A world without Cocoon?,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Player chooses Square - How do you know Lightning?,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The scene ends. She can speak with the members of NORA distributed throughout the town.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You know, I was thinking, if Noel here really is from the future, he must be pretty curious about this time period.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
That's true. We should probably explain a few things.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
I'm all ears.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"We were all born and raised on Cocoon. But three years ago, our home basically fell out of the sky. We couldn't rely on the broken fal'Cie anymore, so most of us made the decision to move to Pulse.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
Weren't there millions of people living on Cocoon? It must have been pretty cramped.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Well, it was. But on Pulse, we had to deal with new hardships, like vicious monsters and a lack of provisions.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
Sounds like a rough time.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Yeah. But things eventually settled down and some former military types helped get things organized. Now there's a growing town at the base of Cocoon's pillar. The guys who used to be in charge are long gone.,CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
"How did you end up in this place, then?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Our leader, Snow, suggested we live somewhere near the ocean. We used to live in a seaside town on Cocoon, so it was like we were rebuilding our home. Snow and the rest of us were used to fighting monsters and getting our hands dirty. So we pretty much settled back into our old way of life. Snow's not around right now, so we do the best we can. But if Lightning were back, everything would be so much better.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
"So for everyone here, your sister being gone is the reality. Odd.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"How about it, future boy? Do you want a quick history lesson?",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
Hear the explanation again?,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Player chooses 'No',ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"I know people have changed since we came down to Pulse. But some folks have even learned how to use magic, like our Serah.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
Player chooses 'Yes',ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Three years ago, our home, Cocoon, came close to breaking apart. After that, most of the residents moved down to Pulse. it was pure chaos for a while, but now the government has things under control. Our group, NORA, used to hang out at one of the coastal towns on Cocoon. That's why our leader, Snow, decided to make this place our new home away from home. Lastly, there's one more thing you should know. It's about Serah's older sister, Lightning-- she disappeared into the pillar holding up Cocoon. Serah was the only one who wouldn't accept it. But then again, if you're telling the truth about what you saw in that other world... ... then maybe Serah's right, and we're the ones who had it all wrong.",CHARACTER,Lebreau,female
I'll bet you anything it's that guy for sure. He looks totally guilty.,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
Hm? What's that now?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
N-n-nothing! I didn't say anything!,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
The only person there at the time was...,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
I'll get that little brat!,CHARACTER,Maqui,male
"Hey there, Serah. Sorry, but I'm not lettin' anyone near that meteorite just yet.",CHARACTER,Gadot,male
"All right then. Hey, Gadot? What do you think those 'artefact' things are? You know, the keys Noel was talking about.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"How should I know. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.",CHARACTER,Gadot,male
So... you do know something?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"N-no, I got no idea! You're not actually swallowing any of that crap, are ya?",CHARACTER,Gadot,male
"I have to give him a chance, at least.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
That meteorite is off-limits.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male
That Noel guy... Stirrin' up a bunch of trouble.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male
He's up to somethin'. I can smell it.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male
Keep an eye out. Never know when some creepy-crawly'll pop outta nowhere.,CHARACTER,Gadot,male
"Hi, Serah. Did you find one of those artefact things?",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
Not yet? Have you been looking too?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"I'd try if I had any idea what I was looking for. You know, Serah...",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
What?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Ah, never mind. Forget it.",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
What's going on?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"You know, Maqui's been acting kind of shifty lately.",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
"If Snow hadn't trained us the way he did, there's no way we could survive here on Pulse.",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
This outfit is so last week. Might be time for a shopping trip.,CHARACTER,Yuj,male
"Where did that rascal get to, I wonder...",CHARACTER,Yuj,male
She can talk or auto-talk with some other people in the area.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
What was Gadot up to so early in the morning? I saw him carrying a knife. What was he up to? No more monsters. No more. Why was I chosen to get rid of the bees' nest? I should just sneak away and get some band practice.,CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member,male
"Hey you guys, did you see a medical kit lying around anywhere? I thought I'd left one in NORA House, but I can't seem to find it. I'm guessing someone had a use for it during that ruckus yesterday.

"Wait, I remember. Wasn't there another path along the shore?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Now that you mention it, there is another route along the shore that the surfers use. There's a path that appears when the tide's low. You can't use it right now, though.",CHARACTER,Male NORA Member Guarding Exit,male

Yuj's is coming out with me next time I go surfing. I can't wait!,CHARACTER,Male NORA Member Guarding Exit,male
The houses along the shore are built to withstand even harsh storms.,CHARACTER,Male NORA Member Guarding Exit,male
"(auto-talk) If we lose Lebreau, who's gonna cook us up the NORA special? Was that really a meteorite? That Team Maqui is full of weirdos. The next leader's gotta be Gadot or Yuj.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 2,male
"Serah, who's your friend?",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
"Someone from a far away place. Noel, is there anything you want to ask?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Tell me more about this town.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
We used to live in a place called Bodhum. That's where we created NORA. But we had to find another place to live after that incident three years back. We left Cocoon and created this town.,CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
"Wow. So that big guy's in charge, huh?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"He's strong like an ox, but he's no leader. Here in town, Lebreau's actually in command. She is the head of NORA, after all. At least, for now.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
"Don't listen to him. Gadot and Lebreau have important roles, but... Without Yuj, we'd never agree on anything, and who knows what we'd do without Maqui's gadgets?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
So the four of them together make the perfect leader. What about Serah? What's her role?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"She's a grade school teacher. A really strict one, too.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
He's teasing again!,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Let me tell you though, no one was a better leader than Snow. He wasthe one who created NORA back when were still on Cocoon.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
Snow was the one who named this town New Bodhum. He didn't want us to forget the old town.,CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
"We lost our old home three years ago. But thanks to Snow, that doesn't matter. This is our home now.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
"I wonder who's stronger, Gadot or Snow.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male

"Hello there, Ms. Farron!",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female
"Oh, hi there. This might be a strange question, but have you seen something that 'shouldn't' exist?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"That's a strange question all right. I wish I could help you, but I've been pretty busy with security duty. Frankly, these days lots of things seem out of the ordinary!",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female
"Yeah, I know. The people here are counting on you guys to protect them. They couldn't survive without NORA.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Well, we can't ask them to fight off the monsters themselves. At least things have improved in these past few years. When the town was first built, NORA was in charge of keeping everyone safe and working the fields. Let me tell you, living on Cocoon, you don't learn to grow vegetables!",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female
"Things are almost back to normal on Cocoon, thanks to the provisional government the army created.",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female
"Bodhum was destroyed three years ago, and now there's nothing left of it. It's ironic to think now, but I would have died if it hadn't been for the Purge.",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female
My younger sister lives near Cocoon. She says she's too scared to live around here 'cause of the monsters.,CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female
"I hear they're constructing a giant elevator to reach Cocoon. The problem is, the airships just can't handle the traffic.",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member,female

"(auto-talk) It's already been three years since I moved here. I can really use a coffee break once I finish my rounds. The crisis is over... Okay, let's get to work! This town reminds me of Bodhum. Oh? The seafood is amazing. It's just a great place to live.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 4,male
"(auto-talk) He makes me so mad sometimes. I cannot believe he did that! Hey, has anyone seen my boots? Ugh, Mark. I don't know what he's thinking. Why do I have to fix the leaky roof?",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member 2,female
"(auto-talk) I honestly thought we were being attacked by a fal'Cie. The sound of the waves remind me of Bodhum. When I was on Cocoon, I did nothing but watch vidshows. Serah, who's that guy with you? All my knives keep getting rusty. I wonder how far they've got in constructing that giant elevator.",CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member 2,female
(auto-talk) You can't use the path along the shore yet. The sentry bots are really useless. I wish Mom coulda seen this new town. I miss the fireworks of old Bodhum. Is it true that Maqui's shop might be going out of business? I could really use some hiking boots.,CHARACTER,Roaming Female NORA Member 3,female

Maybe I couldn't make everyone happy. But at the very least, I could rebuild a future where everyone could survive. So I went through the gate. I wasn't thinking very clearly then. I had a dream, but I didn't think it all out. I didn't know what it really meant. But once I got here, and saw how you and your friends live in this village, I knew my dream could come true.

Did you find out anything more about the meteorite?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Well, to be perfectly honest, not much at all. We did send out a warning to Cocoon, though. Their new provisional government might send help.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
I hope so... But I wouldn't count on it. I hear they're having a hard time keeping Cocoon together as it is.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yeah, I've heard that, too. Apparently, the provisional government is taking over what used to be the job of the fal'Cie. And us NORA members are taking over what should be the job of the government. I guess we have to rely on ourselves.",CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male
I hear there are still lots of people holed up on Cocoon. But I doubt they would come to visit this small backwater town.,CHARACTER,Roaming Male NORA Member 3,male

I just remembered something. I saw Yuj cuddling the NORA House kitty this morning.,CHARACTER,Resident Holed Up in Shack,male
Wasn't Yuj the one who found the cat in the first place?,CHARACTER,Resident Holed Up in Shack,male

(auto-talk) It almost feels like I'm in a movie. They shot a movie here a while ago. All clear!,CHARACTER,Roaming Soldier 1,male
All clear here! We're ready for Atlas! The disturbance originated far within the ruins. All clear here! All clear over there! Neither rain nor giants can bring me down!,CHARACTER,Roaming Soldier 2,male
"(auto-talk) The gear we're using is old, but with Cocoon in its current state, there's not much we can do. We're able to maintain our own gear on the front lines, though, and we're familiar with the equipment. I hear they're building tractors in weapons factories because industrial production is lacking. We used to rely on the fal'Cie for food, energy... everything we needed. But now they're all dormant. Although our gear is old, we have everything we need. We've salvaged a lot of the old PSICOM weapons as well.",CHARACTER,Roaming Soldier 3,male
"(auto-talk) Don't stay home because it's raining. Okay, see you at tomorrow's game! Who's the joker that said it was gonna be sunny today?",CHARACTER,Roaming Soldier 4,male
(auto-talk) Maybe I should take a sick day tomorrow. I really need to get those documents in order. I don't do mud! It's disgusting! I wonder where the chief is. My makeup is going to run!,CHARACTER,Wandering Woman 1,female
(auto-talk) One squeeze of that giant hand... Why is everyone around here so calm? So the monsters are the least of our problems.,CHARACTER,Wandering Woman 2,female
(auto-talk) Hello. He's coming! Oh? I'm researching Atlas's power source.,CHARACTER,Wandering Woman 3,female
"(auto-talk) I don't want to go back to the Sanctum days, but I have to admit things are pretty rough at the moment. The Academy's top priority is finding an energy source to replace the fal'Cie. I'm scared to get close to Atlas, but I do what I have to do because I know my work will help others.",CHARACTER,Wandering Woman 4,female
(auto-talk) Shouldn't we stop the investigation?,CHARACTER,Wandering Woman 5,female
"(auto-talk) Did you hear about the new head of the investigation? Okay, listen to this. Apparently, it's someone Alyssa's age.",CHARACTER,Woman 1,female
"You're kidding! What are they, some kind of genius?",CHARACTER,Woman 2,female
"Well, they probably are. The Academy must have seen their potential right away. They're in charge of an entire department!",CHARACTER,Woman 1,female
That's incredible!,CHARACTER,Woman 2,female
"(auto-talk) Alyssa's really smart, too, for a trainee. I bet someone tries to recruit her into their lab. The Academy totally gives young people a chance to show what they can do.",CHARACTER,Woman 2,female
I really love it here!,CHARACTER,Woman 1,female
(auto-talk) Alyssa's cute and smart--she's going places.,CHARACTER,Woman 2,female
"Well, so are we!",CHARACTER,Woman 1,female
"Definitely! Let's prove ourselves, get promoted, and get some hot assistants!",CHARACTER,Woman 2,female
"(auto-talk) The rain isn't artificial--it's the real thing. I'd forgotten how good it feels on my skin. The army has a rough time fighting the monsters in the rain. If you're heading deep into the ruins, be very careful. The provisional government is behind the Academy 100%. They're counting on us, so we can't let a little rain get in our way. Watch out. The rain will make you lose your grip on the weapon. I can't emphasize enough how careful you should be.",CHARACTER,Wandering Man 1,male
"(auto-talk) We asked the army for help with this investigation. It seemed like the only reasonable thing. What with the paradox and Atlas and monsters, who can feel safe?",CHARACTER,Wandering Man 2,male
"(auto-talk) This is my first time on-site, but I can't. I'm scared... I'm so scared. I'm always locked away in my lab. I'm not used to being around... people. I feel like they're watching me. I can't concentrate! Please, don't talk to me! Don't try to make me feel better... because you can't!",CHARACTER,Man in Corner,male
"(auto-talk) It's so relaxing. Time to take a breather. I focus on theories pertaining to time and space. It's unfortunate that we can't hide from spatial catastrophes. It's a harsh world out there, which is why we need manpower--we need protection. It won't be long until the Academy hires their own army. Oh? Um... ? What is it?",CHARACTER,Sitting Man,male
"This city is several centuries old. Yet based on our studies so far, Atlas is quite obviously from an entirely different time.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 1,female
So Atlas wasn't born from the ruins.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Exactly. It's as if it sprung up here from an entirely different dimension.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 1,female
"To be honest, Atlas scares me. It's not a fal'Cie, or a monster, or like anything made by humans.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 1,female
"Some say that Atlas is actually a weapon, but I don't know. There aren't any records of a weapon of that stature.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 1,female
Mysterious light-emitting structures... ... and the paradox--I think they're both connected with the appearance of Atlas.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 1,female
It's my turn to cook today. Hope you're not a picky eater!,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female
"Oh, no. I'll eat anything. Thank you!",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Good to hear! You know, you need to be able to handle anything in this day and age. (auto-talk) The people at the Academy are so picky. A lot of people even complain about how good their lives used to be. Can you believe it? Hmph. There are trainees who refuse to eat vegetables. It's a shame--the vegetables of Gran Pulse are much tastier than the ones grown on Cocoon. They use the Gran Elevator to transport vegetables from Gran Pulse. That elevator is amazing. Now, getting back and forth from Gran Pulse is a snap!",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female
"What a unique little pet. Well-behaved, too! Is he a monster of some sort?",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 3,female
Not exactly. He's more like a good luck charm.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Is that right? You're such a cute little boy!,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 3,female
Kupo!,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"Oh. I'd love to own a pet, too! But since the Academy is a serious research facility, I'd be better off without one. These days, the only animals I come into contact with are the monsters in the lab. Actually, they are pretty cute, but they're not very snuggly.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 3,female
Atlas has the ability to appear and disappear randomly. Its main physical component actually exists elsewhere.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher 1,male
"So if we want to defeat Atlas, we need to destroy that component.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"We can also try and figure out its spatial manipulation mechanism. I wonder if the paradox has anything to do with it. (auto-talk) An unexplainable phenomenon, a contradiction--that's the paradox. I wonder what kind of world gave birth to Atlas. I doubt a very peaceful one. Is Atlas unstable, or is its main physical component flawed in some fashion? There's also the possibility it uses an advanced form of camouflage. We scientists don't even know how to wield a weapon, but I guess we'll have to learn how to take care of ourselves someday.",CHARACTER,Male Researcher 1,male
"There are four glowing objects deep within the ruins. (The camera shows a Time Gate.) It's packed with monsters back there, though.",CHARACTER,Guard 1,male
Monsters appear suddenly near the glowing objects. Although this one seems pretty quiet right now.,CHARACTER,Guard 1,male
The glowing objects appeared around the same time as the paradox.,CHARACTER,Guard 1,male
The scientists are studying this phenomenon causing all the weird stuff to appear. They're calling it the 'paradox.',CHARACTER,Guard 1,male
I appreciate your help! I apologize for my colleague. He's not a friendly one.,CHARACTER,Guard 2,male
Currently a phenomenon called the paradox has taken effect. Monsters are appearing around those glowing objects. Careful if you're heading deep within the ruins.,CHARACTER,Guard 2,male
"Why did the Academy set up camp here? To investigate, to do research, to develop technology based on Atlas. They were surprised as anyone when that hand started moving.",CHARACTER,Guard 2,male
"The Academy has been focusing their investigation on these ruins in hopes of uncovering lost technology. Since the suspension of the fal'Cie five years ago, life has been... inconvenient.",CHARACTER,Guard 2,male
"The Academy is a new organization, but in a very short amount of time, they've become the main hope for the world's restoration. Their idea is to build an autonomous society based on modern technology.",CHARACTER,Guard 2,male
Please collect a communicator before you proceed. You'll need the ID.,CHARACTER,Guard 3,male
Anyone without an ID will be considered an intruder. No exceptions.,CHARACTER,Guard 3,male
"Five years ago, the Sanctum ordered the Purge and drove people out of their homes. A lot of them escaped and fled. They hid in these ruins, hoping to survive.",CHARACTER,Guard 4,male
It breaks my heart to think of the blood shed by civilians here five years ago.,CHARACTER,Guard 4,male
I'm constantly on edge because I don't know where those terrors will appear next.,CHARACTER,Guard 4,male
If only we could predict where the monsters are going to emerge.,CHARACTER,Guard 4,male
You show interest in the ruins. Are you a student?,CHARACTER,Male Researcher 2,male
"Um, well, I was supposed to go to the capital's university.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"And because of what happened to Cocoon, you gave up your studies? I'm sorry that happened.",CHARACTER,Male Researcher 2,male
It's all right. Things turned out well.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"We here at the Academy have a great responsibility. With the fal'Cie gone, people rely on us to protect humanity.",CHARACTER,Male Researcher 2,male
We need to develop our technology in order to maintain Cocoon. That's why the Academy has been vested with so much authority--for the purpose of research. And we take that responsibility seriously.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher 2,male
"I can tell you this: the Academy respects ability and potential. If you have what it takes, they'll appoint you leader, regardless of your age.",CHARACTER,Male Researcher 2,male

"So, I'm curious.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Yeah?,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"Just why are you helping us, anyway?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
(points at him) I saw you two. I saw how you got here through that thing.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"What, you mean through the gate?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Yes, it is a kind of gate. It links to another world, doesn't it?",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
Kupo.,CHARACTER,Mog,male
Nice to finally have some clue what these things are for.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"So basically, helping us out was almost like part of your research. But you still have questions.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"I do have questions, yes. About the gate, and about the paradox.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"(crossing his arms) But with Atlas throwing his weight around, the ruins'll be closed off and there goes the chance to get your answers.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Noel.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupopo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
No problem. We'll take care of that giant for you.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
You will? Great!,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"The scene ends and a primer is presented on how to change the character controlled in the field and another on types of Time Gates. Playable control is returned to Serah, but the leader can now be changed at any time. Serah can talk to Alyssa again.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You know what I heard? They might be shutting this site down pretty soon. It's all because of Atlas. It's too unsafe with him around. But... but there's still so much I want to explore.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
Here's hoping Atlas stops moving. Then we can get to the bottom of this whole paradox business.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"It's not easy, though, with all these things they keep throwing at me. I'm still a trainee. I mean, I've got my exam to prepare for.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"I'd heard your name before, you know. There are some people who haven't forgotten what the l'Cie started on Cocoon, Serah Farron.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
I don't suppose you've learned anything about Atlas.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"If you notice anything suspicious, let us know.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
We thought we were dealing with your average ruined city until we dug up that gigantic hand. Now they're saying that Cocoon might've had some technologically advanced culture way back in the past.,CHARACTER,Guard at Exit to Main Ruins Area,male
"According to the academics, there are two types of ruins. The normal ruins of old Cocoon cities, and the 'vestiges' brought up from Pulse. These ruins are the normal type--just a place where people used to live hundreds of years ago.",CHARACTER,Guard at Exit to Main Ruins Area,male
Watch out for creatures deeper in the ruins. There's no guarantee security forces will reach you in time.,CHARACTER,Guard at Exit to Main Ruins Area,male

We call him Piggy Kitty.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Kupo!!!,CHARACTER,Mog,male
Piggy Kitty? What a perfect name!,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 3,female
Ku... Kupo...,CHARACTER,Mog,male
Serah and Noel proceed into the main ruins area.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
(auto-talk) Why did you offer to stop the giant?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Because we can't let Atlas shut this place down. We need to search the ruins. There might be other gates we can use.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Like the gate to Valhalla?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Exactly. And how can I take you to Lightning without those handy dandy portals?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Right. We'll do it your way.,CHARACTER,Serah,female

Over monsters?,CHARACTER,Serah,female

The two approach an area with another Time Gate...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"(auto-talk) Another gate, huh? Figures.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"And we need an artefact to open it, right?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Right. The 'key' is something that doesn't belong in this time.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
They can talk or auto-talk with people in this area.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"(auto-talk) Lots of unfamiliar monsters emerge in this area. The more information we can gather, the better our chances of saving our men. The army has been gathering intel on the monsters for a long time, but a lot of the records were lost in the confusion. Monsters we'd never seen before began appearing along with the paradox effect. No one knows if they're mutations, or a new species, or man made, or what. It could be the monsters are as scared of us as we are of them.",CHARACTER,Soldier 1,male

"N-no, we're okay. Thank you for asking.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"I'm terribly sorry. I couldn't be more apologetic. I've been told I can be quite nosy. No, I know it may seem hard to believe, but all my men tease me about being a busybody. I just want to understand my men so I can help them if need be. They don't even need me, really. I am a commanding officer, though. When I was a young soldier, talking behind your commanding officer's back was unheard of. Really, it was impossible. Things sure are different nowadays. It's our sworn duty to protect the people of the Academy, all of them. Our future depends on their work.",CHARACTER,Soldier 2,male
"(another soldier) Exploring are we? Might wanna be careful in here. Someone spotted a Cie'th in one of the tunnels, deeper in the ruins. We haven't seen a Cie'th on Cocoon for several years now.

They say the Cie'th was seen in the tunnels further in. Did you spot anything yet?,CHARACTER,Chester,male

Where could those damn capsules have disappeared to?,CHARACTER,Captain,male
Player chooses 'Yes',ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"You'll help us search for the capsules? We could certainly use an extra hand or two. We're missing two capsules. They look just like ordinary medicine. If you find them, bring them directly to me.",CHARACTER,Captain,male

He was always trying to... ... get me to do his share of the work. Then one day he asked me to go hunting with him. I refused. I'd had enough of being bossed around. So he ended up heading out alone.

That's when the ceiling of our hiding place collapsed. Ever since then, I've had the same dream. I'm trapped under rubble. It's dark, I'm in pain, and I can barely breathe. The next thing I know, I rise out of my body, and I'm standing before this grave. (points) And the name written on the stone... It's mine.

It's important that we fight these unfamiliar monsters. We need to gather data to avoid needless casualties. If another paradox occurs, we might have to face even stronger monsters.

It wasn't a fight that could be won by brute force. We were able to weaken him first by resolving the paradox.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
So you managed to cut Atlas off from the source of his existence? It might be a good idea for us to team up with the scientists.,CHARACTER,Guard 3,male

I didn't mean to get in the way of your work.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Don't worry--I think you two did the right thing. It was too advanced for us to control anyway. It's a very dangerous technology.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female
"Personally, I don't want to rely on crystals. For all we know, that could lead to the fal'Cie ending up in charge again. And nobody wants that.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female
The Academy was created by the provisional government. Its mandate wasclear: To replace the fal'Cie with science and modern technology.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female
The Academy strives for self-sufficiency. The policy is strongly supported by the provisional government--they don't want a repeat of what happened here on Cocoon.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female

I hope we land right in the place where Lightning is waiting. Where do you think we'll end up this time? The future? The past?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"I have no idea. With all this jumping back and forth, I'm not sure I know which is which anymore. (Serah chuckles.) But the past is what makes us who we are, defines us as people.

That makes sense.,CHARACTER,Serah,female

Kupo!?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
It's so dark.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"In ancient times, the fal'Cie devoured the light, darkness cloaked the sky, and the earth knew only night. This must be the eclipse.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
You know what this is?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"They said five hundred years ago, a massive fal'Cie appeared. For a while, it blotted out the sun and turned everything dark.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"If that happened five hundred years in your past, then this must be two hundred years in my future.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Right. But something's wrong. Look, the eclipse is only affecting this small area. That shouldn't be possible.",CHARACTER,Noel,male

The cutscene ends and playable control is given to Serah or Noel.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"(auto-talk) This reminds me of the stories we heard, that there used to be a giant city on Gran Pulse. I bet this what these ruins are.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
What happened to it?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
No one's been able to figure that out. We were more or less locked up inside Cocoon. We never had much opportunity to learn about the world below us. Our scientists have only just begun to study the mysteries of Gran Pulse.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
The story so far...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

"Wait, you can't just-- Noel!",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yaschas Massif, 10 AF, sir.",CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male
10 AF? So nowhere near two hundred years.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"I must say, this is the first time anyone asked me what year it was. I don't suppose you happen to be time travelers?",CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male
Well...,CHARACTER,Serah,female

Keep your wits about you. There's no telling what kind of monsters the paradox has let loose here.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male
You said the paradox. Are you talking about the eclipse?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Yes. The great fal'Cie Fenrir blocked out the sun. It was predicted he would appear two hundred years from now. Which means...,CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male

Some areas may still be sealed off. We've yet to determine if those sections are safe.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male
We have no idea what caused the aberration.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male
There are several paradox theories floating around.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male
It's terrifying to consider what the fal'Cie's purpose might be.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher,male

"(auto-talk) I don't care if things are bad; I'd rather be on Cocoon. I like the benefits, but working on Pulse... It's night all the time! I can't deal with this. I thought I was going to be assigned to a research lab. I am not an outdoors kinda person.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 1,female
(auto-talk) Has everyone forgotten the incident from ten years ago? You only realize how important something is when it's gone. We didn't experience eclipses on Cocoon. This darkness reminds me of days of the past. We'll never be able to go back our ordinary lives.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 2,female
"(auto-talk) Once you get used to it, life on Pulse isn't bad. Some are worried that the Academy will take its advanced ideas too far. I hope this doesn't lead to an outright revolt. The food is so much better than on Cocoon. It's strange because as a kid, I was told that Pulse was some kind of hell. There seems to be a rift between the ones who stayed on Cocoon and the ones who moved to Pulse.

I'm sure. I remember the dates pretty clearly.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Then I guess it must be a paradox. Scary to think we can't trust our memories though.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"If history changes, do our memories change, too? Say we change the past. The things I remembered... the things I should know... do I just forget them?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"That kinda sounds like what happened with Lightning, right? Could that be why no one remembers what happened to her?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Maybe, but we can't know for sure. In any case, I remember everything since we first met. At least, I think I do.",CHARACTER,Noel,male

Noel from the future.",CHARACTER,Serah,female

"A sense of duty. Vanille, Fang, Lightning... They turned to crystal so that we might live. It was an enormous sacrifice.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
My sister and the others... I think they wanted to preserve life. They gave us a chance to live again.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
The party can now roam freely. They return to the area where the boss was before...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
I'm terribly sorry about how I treated you before. It was very rude. Especially since I hear you two are the time travelers the director was waiting for.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher on guard,female
Do you always have to work in such dangerous areas?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
We didn't feel in danger... ... since the army was always there to protect us. But we were too confident; we got too careless.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher on guard,female
Our success at predicting your unconventional arrival has proven our theory to be true.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher on guard,female
The director can't wait to meet you. He's been holding his breath in anticipation!,CHARACTER,Female Researcher on guard,female

I've been waiting so long to meet you! You two are the reason I've continued my research for as long as I have!,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 5,female
"I remember the horrible incident from ten years ago as if it happened yesterday. I lost my goals and my dreams and my motivation. I lost everything. But all of that changed five years ago, at the Bresha Ruins.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 5,female
You suddenly appeared before our eyes out... out of nowhere... That sparked my curiosity. I had to find out how that was possible.,CHARACTER,Female Researcher 5,female
"I strive to be like the director. I, of course, respect him as an authority figure, but I also respect him as a person.",CHARACTER,Female Researcher 5,female
"This is a fal'Cie that was uncovered in these ruins. Seems he had a deep connection with the people of Paddra. We've tried analyzing it with the Academy's equipment, but nothing yet. However, it does seem to react to another device that we found in these ruins.",CHARACTER,Male Laborer,male
The tragedy from ten years ago was caused by someone uncovering an ancient fal'Cie.,CHARACTER,Male Laborer,male
"The Academy's focusing their efforts on finding out more about the device, rather than the fal'Cie.",CHARACTER,Male Laborer,male
We're simply excavators. Nothing more than cogs in the investigation.,CHARACTER,Male Laborer,male
They speak with Alyssa...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
How long has it been? Five years? You two haven't changed at all.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"I hope not. And here we are, meeting in ruins again.",CHARACTER,Noel,male

What about the Academy? How are things going?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
I'd say the institution has grown considerably since the last time we met.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female

"Without the fal'Cie around, we have to be able to protect ourselves. And that means guns.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"The time distortions spawn hostile creatures. Until we can resolve the paradox, we need military force to repel threats. These armed patrols are essential for our safety.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
The party moves forward again and then Hope stops. They can auto-talk with some people...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
(auto-talk) Can't you just go through the gate and change the events of the past? I wonder if we can make the gates accessible to everyone.,CHARACTER,Male Researcher 1,male

I always had doubts. And it wasn't just me. Sazh had them as well.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
"Really? Sazh, too?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yes. He couldn't believe that Lightning would just 'up and leave Serah like that.' After all, she was the one who said we shouldn't face things alone, that we should stick together.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"I'm glad to see you're doing well, Serah.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
If the player has already visited the Sunleth Waterscape...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"Actually, Hope, we were able to catch up with Snow.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Just three hundred years in the future. If you can believe that.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
I believe it. Good old Snow. I'm glad to hear he's alive.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
"He's alive, but he was trying to protect the crystal pillar all by himself. The worst part is we had to leave without being able to tell him where we were going.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Have faith. I think I understand what Snow's going through. He's trying to save Vanille and Fang. Not to mention Lightning as well. We're only here today because they chose to bear the weight of a world.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
I wonder how the others are doing.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
I wonder how Sazh and little Dajh are doing.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"We've been out of touch. Sazh took Dajh to live on Gran Pulse, and he was flying airships the last I heard. Then suddenly, they both disappeared. I... I searched everywhere but never found them.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Look at us--all gone our separate ways.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yes, and I can't tell you how much it means to have you here now. Sazh and Snow may have set off on different paths, but I've started to think that in the end, we're all headed towards the same goal.",CHARACTER,Hope,male

A great many things have happened.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
A cutscene begins...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"This is some kind of ancient city, right?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
The city of Paddra. Or so we believe. it was the center of a great kingdom built by a nation known as the 'Farseers.',CHARACTER,Hope,male
The Farseers? You're telling me there used to be enough of them to build this entire town?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"According to our research, we believe they constituted an entire nation, a polity that was ruled by a seeress.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
(staring out at the city) Can you see me now? Standing here in this place...,CHARACTER,Noel,male
The scene ends.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"(auto-talk) So this nation... Paddra? Their leader was a seeress, right?",CHARACTER,Serah,female

Yeul...,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"The party follows hope to a new area, protected by a Guard...",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

After talking to Hope...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
(extending his hand to Serah) Here.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
(taking his hand) Thanks.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
You've traveled through time. I suppose it's not surprising you know about these things. The power to rule was passed down from one seeress to the next. She was always called 'Yeul.',CHARACTER,Hope,male
"If they could read time, why did they die out? Surely they could see the danger coming, and do something to avoid it.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"No, they were destroyed because they could see the future.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
Why?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"The seeress Yeul foresaw the future destruction of this city. Some citizens wanted to try to avert the disaster. Others felt that they should simply abandon their homes and run. A few fell into despair, and took their own lives. The divided populace clashed. The nation was torn apart by civil war.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Being able to see the future is awfully dangerous. It can mess with people's heads.,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"Tell me about it. The nation fell apart, and the survivors fled into the wildlands, avoiding contact with others.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Huh. So you know the story?,CHARACTER,Hope,male
"Oh! Come on, Director Hope! I want to show them! It's okay to show them, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"This way. Here, this is what lies at the heart of our paradox. The Oracle Drive. We've been giving it careful study.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"(stepping forward) But, how did you--!?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Wait, you know of these devices?",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"Oh, uh... yeah. I've--I've heard of them. In... books and stuff.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"The Oracle Drive appears to be some kind of recording apparatus from ancient times. We've excavated a number of the devices. However, the recordings depict... things that cannot be possible. Perhaps you should see for yourselves.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"This is how it works. (He activates it and a beam of energy radiates outward, towards the fal'Cie, with projects an image.)",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Kupo. Kupooo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"The projection appears. It shows many images, including Ragnarok, Cocoon-fall, and Lightning...",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
The device was excavated from an ancient part of the ruins. We used carbon dating methods to determine age. The device and the recording stored within are several centuries old.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
But it shows Lightning...,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Someone in the past recorded this vision of the future. Perhaps it was the seeress, Yeul, herself. What we're concerned about, however, is this. You'll have to excuse the image quality.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
A new scene begins. It shows Lightning's struggle in Valhalla with Caius.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Was that my sister?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"Yes, I think so. We need to conduct further analysis to be certain.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Is it broken?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"No. We've tested both the device and data and everything is nominal. Yet, when we try to view the recording, we get this. Perhaps it's not the recording that's broken... ... it's the immediate spacetime in which we are located.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"You mean it could be the paradox. Because the surrounding spacetime is twisted, that might be directly affecting the device. So if the paradox is eliminated, spacetime will return to normal. Then we could see the prophecy, and find out where my sister is!",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupo!,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"Yes, I believe so...",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Great!,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Here. (He presents an artefact.),CHARACTER,Hope,male
An artefact!,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupopo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"This object serves as a key, is that right? We tried to make it work ourselves, but with no success.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"Yeah, we can use that to travel across time.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Then you may have it. I think it'll be far more useful to you than us. Here. (He hands it to Noel.),CHARACTER,Hope,male
Artefact Discovered! You obtain a Hollow Artefact!,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"(narrating) During the years that passed as we traveled outside time and space... Hope had devoted himself to his research, trying to unlock the mystery of the paradox. If the gates are the cause of the puzzle, they might also be the key to unlocking it. But I wonder, am I getting closer? Will I find Lightning in the end?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Time to find that gate.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
It was in the ruins.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
The party can talk with Hope...,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
You understand why I wanted to show you the Oracle Drive?,CHARACTER,Hope,male
"I think I do. You've been looking for Lightning, too, all this time.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yes. It's not much of a clue, but I thought you should see it all the same. And I wanted you to see how far we've come.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Live Trigger Hope has been analyzing the Oracle Drive and the images that appear to be Lightning. What should I ask him?,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Player chooses Triangle - Tell us about the Paddra Ruins.,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
Tell us about these ruins. What have you learned about Paddra so far?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"We're still excavating, gathering clues, and putting things together, but Paddra was likely founded before the War of Transgression.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"And that was, what? Six hundred and eighty years ago?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Yes. We've actually found records in an Oracle Drive that describe the conflict. 'The seeress gazed into the future, and saw war that would occur after her own nation was destroyed.'",CHARACTER,Hope,male
We've still barely scratched the surface here.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
The Oracle Drive is my main field of research.,CHARACTER,Hope,male

"Huh, I've never thought of it like that. I've been so focused on finding my sister...",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"Well, of course you are.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
"Oh, hi. Still wandering around the ruins?",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
They found traces of what looks like a large-scale battle in these ruins. They uncovered piles of bones that were all scratched up.,CHARACTER,Female Guard,female
"They must've been fighting monsters, too.",CHARACTER,Serah,female

She's out there.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
Then I'm going find her.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupokupo.,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"And you will find her, Serah. After all, you traveled through time and found me. Many years of research have finally borne fruit. It all began with the Oracle Drive. We excavated it from ruins many centuries old.. ... yet it recorded an image of Cocoon supported on a pillar of crystal. It was an impossibility, an enigma. Impossible... but a reality nonetheless. This is when I learned what I must do.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Hmm?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
If it was possible to journey through time and look into the future... ... then it must also be possible to travel backwards and change the past.,CHARACTER,Hope,male

So that's what your research was about.,CHARACTER,Serah,female

"Not necessarily rewritten. It could be the original prophecy, restored as it once was. Perhaps a continuation of the first recording.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"If this is showing us the future, then someday Cocoon will fall. Noel, you told me in your time, Cocoon didn't exist like it does now.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
"Yeah. It came to ground long before I was born. After it happened, the whole world just fell apart pretty much.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
But who made it fall? Could it have been Caius?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
No. He couldn't do that.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
When is Cocoon supposed to fall? How many years? Is it soon?,CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
No. Not for a couple of centuries.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"(looks relieved) Oh, that's a long time from now. I mean, none of us'll even be alive to see it.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female
But others will. Cocoon will fall into Gran Pulse. Imagine the catastrophe. Think how many lives will be destroyed.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
Right. That's the future I lived in.,CHARACTER,Noel,male

"Well, we...",CHARACTER,Serah,female
It might not be necessary to travel to the specific time and place.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
How so?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"The future depends on what we do now, right? Yes, there is chance Cocoon will fall, but we can start working now to prevent it from happening.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
Right.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"But what if you can't, Hope?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"We can at least work to mitigate the damage. If we begin our research now, we have time. Then, should Cocoon indeed fall, we can help protect the planet and save the victims.",CHARACTER,Hope,male
"Okay, let's do it. We can try to solve things at the other end, in the future...",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Kupo?,CHARACTER,Mog,male
While you start preparing in the here and now.,CHARACTER,Noel,male

"Lightning was fighting in Valhalla. That's where I met her, and that's when she told me to come and find Serah.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
I see. Valhalla... otherwise known as the Unseen World.,CHARACTER,Hope,male
I think Lightning wants us to fix the timeline. Put it back how it was. Maybe that's why she gave me the power to travel through time and control monsters.,CHARACTER,Serah,female

"With paradoxes, anything's possible. 'Until someone from the future peeks inside time, the past remains uncertain.' Do you remember talking about that? Paradoxes are spacetime entanglements, differing possibilities sealed in a box. When an observer peers into the future and corrects its contradictions, possible past histories collapse into a single timeline.",CHARACTER,Alyssa,female

She was turned into a C'ieth, and was forced to wander the Yaschas Massif for all of eternity. According to the legend, she's still there, waiting for someone to defeat her and help put her soul to rest.

For example, if you make it rain, the monsters near watering holes will become more vicious. And rare monsters with extraordinary strength may appear.

I hadn't thought of that. Last time he attacked us right away... ... and now he's hiding behind the fal'Cie and the artificial intelligence.,CHARACTER,Serah,female

Yeul. Are you on your own?,CHARACTER,Noel,male

I brought you this.,CHARACTER,Yeul,female
Why? What should we do with it? (She catches it.),CHARACTER,Serah,female
You must protect the timeline. I saw you in Oerba. I trust you. I believe in you.,CHARACTER,Yeul,female
"We're in the same time as when we met in Oerba. So, you're the same Yeul.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
(nods) Yes.,CHARACTER,Yeul,female
"But, who are you? Who are the Farseers?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
I am the seeress of the oldest tribe on Pulse. My visions of the future are recorded and stored in the Oracle Drive. But that... is long in the past. There is no more need to record the prophecies. I have Caius now.,CHARACTER,Yeul,female
What do you mean?,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"He is tasked with protecting the seeress and remembering her visions. Now and forever, he will remember the entire timeline. Caius, he is beyond death.",CHARACTER,Yeul,female

"(nods) The seeress possesses the Eyes of Etro. And inside Caius beats the Heart of Chaos. The goddess has gifted him the curse of eternity. He is a Guardian, and his mission is to protect the seeress. The power to see the future is a terrible weapon. It can turn history into chaos.",CHARACTER,Yeul,female
"But then, I don't understand. Why are you helping us? I mean, you do know we're trying to change history, right?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"History has already been broken. The timeline had been twisted before I met you. The distortion leads to a future of death and destruction. If you change the future, you can change the past and correct the distortions. The miracle that saved Cocoon has already been altered.",CHARACTER,Yeul,female

Kupo.,CHARACTER,Mog,male
Yeah.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"If you change the future again, the true past will be restored. The past that you still remember, Serah. Together, the two of you can correct the timeline.",CHARACTER,Yeul,female

Yes. Can you tell us something else? Someone has been laying traps for us inside this tower. Do you know who's behind it?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
Your enemy. It is here inside the tower. It has generated the contradictions that threaten you. (points) The machine is sentient.,CHARACTER,Yeul,female

This place must be like the Void Beyond. A crossroads where the future and past intersect.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"And that would enable time travel. Noel, do you realize what this means? The Proto fal'Cie could have used this place to travel through time and infiltrate the artificial intelligence. Then it could have manipulated the AI to kill all the humans in the tower... ... and build the fal'Cie of Academia's future.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"You're saying the Proto fal'Cie took control of the AI and ordered it to build... the Proto fal'Cie. It's a closed loop, a chicken-and-egg paradox.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
Right. A paradox is exactly what it is. The Proto fal'Cie was trying to protect the distortion that gave birth to it.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
And it knew all along that it was part of the paradox.,CHARACTER,Noel,male

However, this created a distortion in time which continued to grow. As it spread, it began to swallow innocent victims one by one. When they were taken, all that remained were crimson orbs, orbs that contained their grief and anguish. Each one a silent reproach, reminding me of the terrible mistake that I had made.

Was there even a right choice to make? If she had done nothing, people would have died. But the city that Yeul so desperately hoped to save was eventually destroyed. No matter what her decision, either choice would have eventually led to the death of the people of Paddra. I don't have the ability to see into the future like she does. And I'm thankful for that.

If you're in a bad situation with friends, someone's got your back. If you're alone, you're done for. Speakin' of tough times, things still haven't gotten much better. I wandered into this strange, psychedelic world, and now I'm gambling to win the prize of a lifetime. I've got something important on the line, and you know I'm not one to back down.

At first I was overwhelmed with loss, but soon even that feeling faded away with the rest. Now every day is paradise. Lightning is here with me, and Snow as well. Lebreau and Yuj, Gadot and Maqui, the whole gang. Sometimes Sazh and his son come to visit. And guess what? Hope had some great news for us. He said he was pretty sure they might be able to save Vanille and Fang from the pillar. I'm content. I like my life the way it is. There's only one thing that keeps it from being perfect. I can't remember a certain person. I know he was a friend. And I'm sure we were close. But no matter how I try, I can't recall his face or his name, or even how his voice sounded. (A shadowy form of Noel appears before Serah.) It's so strange. Who could he be? In my room, I have a mirror. I never use it. It scares me. On the other side of that mirror, there's a whole other world. And if I peek inside, I'll be lost. Or so it seems to me. When I told Snow how I felt, of course, he said I was just being silly. (She looks into the mirror.) Maybe I am. I can live with that. All I want is for these magical, wonderful days to continue. For this time to stretch on forever. This is where I'll stay. I'm home.

"More than one miracle took place day. Cocoon was saved by Fang and Vanille's sacrifice. We awoke from our crystal sleep, and our brands were gone. It was Etro's blessing that was our salvation.

"(narrating) I felt a whirlwind of emotions. A large part of it was happiness. And relief was there, too. But somewhere inside, I still felt uneasy. Vanille and Fang were gone. And the world hung in silence. Our fight had just ended... ... but I couldn't relax. A new battle was about to begin. (Energy begins streaking around Lightning... ) What is that!? Watch out! (narrating) The events of that day tore open a portal to another world. (Back in the scene.) Get off me! (narrating) And from the depths of the rift appeared a darkness that had no place in our world-- an irresistible force that dragged me away to the edge of time. The screams of the dying had unlocked a gate-- A door that led directly to the throne of the goddess. Etro waited beyond the gate, and sent her miracles to the human world. But a creeping darkness slipped through, and threatened to devour our reality. Etro closed the gate, and warped the timeline. Time's flow was altered, and existence itself was distorted. I was lost. The darkness caught me in its embrace, and wrote me out of history. (In the flashback, Lightning finds herself on the shore of Valhalla.) Where am I? (narrating) Valhalla. Beyond time. Beyond life and death. A netherworld of shifting gloom. The chaotic realm of the goddess Etro. What power had brought me to this alien shore? From Valhalla's heart, I could track the entire span of time. I gazed upon the future of mankind, and sensed Etro's divine will. (In the flashback, she is transformed into her new, feathery costume.) The goddess was fading away. If her spirit should cease to be, the world would descend into entropy. I made my choice. I will fight. (flashback of the fight with Caius) This man, Caius Ballad. He seeks to destroy all hope, and bring an end to the future. Though the battle might be endless, I will never give up. Etro has chosen us--her champions. And we cannot fail.",CHARACTER,Lightning,female
"It all started with Valhalla, is that right? Whatever came from there created the paradoxes... ... caused the gates to appear, and twisted the timeline.",CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Lightning, what did you see?",CHARACTER,Serah,female
"I don't know. It was an enormous power. Something that shouldn't exist in this world. Only Etro can control the power and keep it contained in Valhalla. If she were to disappear, there would be nothing to stop it. And that's what Caius wants. He plans to find Etro sleeping in her temple, kill her, and release the power. The chaos would be unleashed into the realm of humans. Into our world, through the Unseen Gate.",CHARACTER,Lightning,female
A gate.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"When a person dies, her soul flies to the otherworld, and passes through that portal. If a great many people die at once, the gate must open wide to let them through.",CHARACTER,Lightning,female

Exactly. It would be unstoppable. The power of chaos would gush through the gate like floodwater through a broken dam.,CHARACTER,Lightning,female
What would happen to the world then?,CHARACTER,Noel,male
"Chaos would infect everything. It would become pure entropy, without life, or death, or time.",CHARACTER,Lightning,female
"No life or death? You mean like Valhalla. That's what Caius is after! If he can bring down Cocoon, millions of people would die, and the power of chaos... ... would turn this world into another Valhalla.",CHARACTER,Serah,female
Yes. Caius is trying to create a world where time does not exist. If he can erase time...,CHARACTER,Lightning,female
Yeul would be saved. And not just Yeul. All the seeresses down through the ages. They'd be released from their curse. (Lightning nods.) He wants to sacrifice Cocoon to rebuild the world in Valhalla's image all for the sake of Yeul.,CHARACTER,Noel,male
That's why you were fighting Caius in Valhalla. You're protecting Etro.,CHARACTER,Serah,female
"We have to face Caius on two fronts: in Valhalla, and in the world of humans. If we don't... We won't be able to change the future. I can't do it on my own. I need your help.",CHARACTER,Lightning,female
"(narrating) Lightning then told us what would happen to Cocoon. In 500 AF, the old Cocoon would collapse and fall into Pulse, the crystal pillar no longer strong enough to support it. By that time, Hope and the Academy would have completed the new Cocoon, but... When they attempted to launch it, Caius would intervene. He would smash it into the old Cocoon, and bring them both down. (The narration ends.) So we have to travel to 500 AF, and stop Caius from destroying Cocoon.",CHARACTER,Serah,female

The culprit was responsible for the monster population increase and for taking out those who knew the passwords. I believe that a group that opposed the Academy's ideals used the paradox for their own gain. They tried to destroy the institution once and for all.

"(narrating over a fiery scene) A colossal war once raged across the land. The spark was the pillar of Cocoon, growing weaker by the day, threatening to collapse. Among the people, there were those who sought to resurrect the fal'Cie. They wanted to use their power to avert catastrophe. However, there were many who feared the fal'Cie and their part in Cocoon's history. The populace was split. Anger divided them. Over the course of time, the debate escalated into war. As the battle raged on, one side created soldiers the size of mountains. Instead of surrendering, their rivals retaliated by building their own massive weapons. What began as a dispute between humans, became an earth-shattering war between giants. The titanic conflict grew beyond the people's ability to control. Pulse became a scorched battlefield. And eventually, what they set out to protect, was destroyed.",CHARACTER,Yeul,female

(narrating) Yeul doesn't see visions in this place. She says it's because time has stopped. There is no future. I don't know if there's a way to change the events of the past anymore. But we're still searching for a gate--one that will let us travel through time like before. Serah's not one to give up. She's a positive influence on all of us.

"The goddess bestowed on Caius Ballad the Heart of Chaos. Only a Guardian of the same tribe may ever hope to wrest that power from him. And so Caius waited. He waited for one who possessed the strength to defeat him. After many centuries, his patience was rewarded with the arrival of Noel, the last Guardian to be born. Caius pinned all his hopes on this child. The immortal did not want Noel to simply succeed him--he wanted Noel to surpass him.",ACTION,ACTION,ACTION

Paradox Ending: Heir to Chaos,ACTION,ACTION,ACTION
"(narrating) That's when I saw memories of his past, his life. I saw the day he slayed his predecessor, and became a l'Cie to protect the seeress. I saw the great war, and how it tore Gran Pulse apart. I saw the battle in which he saved the seeress from her enemies, and was crowned a hero. All he ever wanted was for Yeul to be happy. The goddess Etro was struck by his undying devotion, and offered Caius her own heart. With this, he became an immortal being, one who could protect Yeul till the end of time. That marked the beginning. The beginning of his eternal nightmare. I have Caius's memories inside me. Just like Caius before me, I've received the terrible gift of eternal life. And Serah, she's now destined to live the fate of a Farseer, just like Yeul. Caius had put all his hopes in me. He believed that I was the one that could stop the beating of his cursed heart. But I couldn't. I wasn't strong enough. The heart took over my body and threw me into an endless spiral--a prison without end. But then... I saw a light. I don't know where it leads. I don't know what kind of world is out there, waiting for me. But I do know one thing--I have to take Caius's place. I'm his successor. I can't escape this fate. This is just the beginning of my never-ending nightmare. I have to face whatever's out there, in that unknown world. I have to save Yeul. I have to save Serah. The gift of immortality made me realize that hope is a double-edged blade. It's cruel to those who cling to impossible dreams. For the undying, this torment haunts them for all eternity. Caius lived knowing the futility of his single plea, his single hope. I wonder what awaits me. A life without hope? A life without friendship? A life of utter solitude?",CHARACTER,Noel,male
