A fine addition to the bedchambers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just what I always wanted!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How about we put this... there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Redecorating once again, I see?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Indecisive as ever.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
An utterly unnecessary change.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What did you do now...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What are you doing now?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What have you done this time...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You use your limited authority for that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A change for change's sake.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blast, just leave it be!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What are you even going on about?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Whose House do you think this is?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Augh, what did you do, now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You need not listen to him, Contractor!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Was that truly necessary, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why bother with such triviality?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Utterly senseless.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It was fine!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Leave that poor Contractor alone.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Can you believe this, Cerberus?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're wasting everybody's time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's take that down for now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's pack that up for now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Teardown approved, Contractor.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I miss the way things used to be with that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's go without that for a bit, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What say we change things up again, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's shift some things around if you don't mind.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'd like to see how that looks the other way again, please.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
All right if we restore that to the way it was before?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's bring that back I think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's put that up again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's see how this looks again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's put this back up, why not.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's go ahead with this again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think we'd better go with this option instead.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think we ought to mix things up a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's try this on for size instead, OK?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's make an adjustment over here again, Contractor.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"We're going to reconfigure that bit once again, Contractor.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I wanted to see how this looks again if that's all right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How about we make an adjustment right over here if that's OK.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Guess what, Contractor? Changed my mind again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think I want to change things up again right over here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm thinking we should freshen things a bit right over here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Eh, let's see how it looks this other way, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think we'd better go with this option instead.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What say we change things up again, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's try this on for size instead, OK?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Excuse me while I swap your bedding for you, boy.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's change the bedding up for Cerberus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This other bedding seems a better fit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hard to decide which bedding type to choose.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Changed my mind about those columns there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's go back to an older style for those columns.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I should check in with the House Contractor.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Ought to spend some of these gems with the House Contractor.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wonder what jobs the House Contractor has available.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

What did you expect.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Surely you could have avoided that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That was inevitable.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll see you back at home.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You are a weakling, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Was that truly your best?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Die, like a mere mortal.",CHARACTER,Hades,male

A very tragic end.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Your time is up, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
So much for that attempt.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Whatever happened there?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You don't have what it takes. Nobody does.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A tragic end fit for a poet's verse.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How many deaths is that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You never seem to learn.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What did I tell you?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You wouldn't dare.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How did you... grrr.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go on and try.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're going nowhere, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male

At least the Fury Sisters are on better terms.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Megaera failed again?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're not permitted to leave Tartarus...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It seems the Fury failed to do her job.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Megaera seems to be having difficulties.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go on to Asphodel, and die.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Did you enjoy this stint in Tartarus?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Tartarus has proved unable to contain you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Alecto failed...?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Alecto failed just as her sister did.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Tisiphone has failed me, has she.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Tisiphone, defeated...?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
So much for the fearsome Furies.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I ought to lock you up in Tartarus.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How many times...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Enjoy the searing heat of Asphodel.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Here's to a pleasant voyage up in Asphodel.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Do bathe yourself in magma when you get to Asphodel.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Suitably achieved, this time around.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The Furies seem incapable of thwarting you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Your progress has been duly noted, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Is Tartarus some sort of joke to you?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Those wretches of Tartarus cannot be relied upon.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You'll have more difficulties up in Asphodel.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Are you suitably warmed up for Asphodel?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's see how you fare in warmer environs.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Alecto's performance has been lacking as of late.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That Tisiphone has met her match with you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Megaera had better not be going easy on you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hrm, already made it out of Tartarus...",CHARACTER,Hades,male

"The Hydra fell to you again, did it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Where do you think you're going?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No paradise awaits you, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Tread lightly, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You are testing my patience.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Still there, are you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
We'll have you back here soon enough I think.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go no further, boy. I'm warning you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How could you, boy? That Hydra had a family!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That victory of yours shall be short-lived.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, I didn't see you come in.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I trust you had a pleasant stay in Asphodel?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You think you can just walk into Elysium, do you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Off to taint Elysium again?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
King Theseus is eager to see you again soon.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Just as we were finishing cleaning up Elysium...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
They're already expecting you up in Elysium.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Short work of the Hydra, then, I take it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Had enough heat for now, I presume?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That blasted Hydra never takes my feedback...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It seems you're off to cooler climates, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The Bloodless failed to stop you once again...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You crossed through all of Asphodel's defenses...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hrm, you crossed through Asphodel quite rapidly...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Emerged from Asphodel intact, have you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
C_PostBoss01 Lines,CHARACTER,Hades,male
King Theseus has fallen to the likes of you?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your struggles soon shall be in vain.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You really think you can get out of here?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
So you thwarted the Champion of Elysium.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Don't make me come up there, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nothing good awaits beyond my realm.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The worst is yet to come, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You think you can just walk away from me?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A disappointing show from Theseus.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Must I send Cerberus to block your path again?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I shall have to have a word with our King Theseus.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your stubborness shall only bring you pain.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I shall stop you by my own hand if I must.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go give the vermin in the Temple my regards.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Befriended any Satyrs lately, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You force me to send Cerberus ahead, again.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Cerberus is patiently at work, instead of resting here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I suppose that I shall be seeing you quite soon.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hurry up, then, and I shall see you outside.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go tend to the Satyr problem, for a change.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You made short work of Theseus, I take it, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The finest of Elysium all failed to thwart you, eh?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It seems I had best prepare myself, at this rate.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You won't get through me quite that easily.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So close to the surface, already...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Elysium ought to be harder to escape than that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Already made it that far, have you, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I sure did, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You are correct, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It most certainly did.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It fell to me, indeed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think I'm going to Elysium.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You know exactly where.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I figured, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh I'm sure it's fine.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanks for the tip.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Don't know any other way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sounds like progress to me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I am, indeed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Seems that way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We'll see.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Don't count on it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Or else what, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sorry, can't turn back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
So do I.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Not in the mood for your jesting, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There's always the next one.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What are you, the Three Fates?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't worry, won't be long.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, I did.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh very much.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You really need to turn down the heat in that place.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Yes, yes I do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I absolutely do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
C_PostBoss01 responses,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
They weren't that great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Don't forget Asterius!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
He's all talk.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
So you keep saying.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You know nothing of my struggles.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What gave you that idea?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I guess word travels fast.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I thwarted him all right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Not making you do anything.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Stay home, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll be the judge of that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm sure I'll find something.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Looking forward to it!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"See you soon, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's more of a brisk jog.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Better off this way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Perhaps your expectations are too high.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I pray his ego will recover soon.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No, but you're going to anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You leave Cerberus out of this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Tell him I said hi.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mind asking him to tone it down a bit?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What would you know of it?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What are you, the Fates?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I welcome you to try.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Then I'll deal with you same as all the rest.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You test my patience!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You had your chance!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hrryyaaaahhh!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Grraaauuuugggghhh!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You wish to anger me?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male

I shall not take such disrespect from you!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male

Would be odd of you to start right now!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What, you mean like last time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Think we both know the answer to that one!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Not really, though, why do you ask?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I guess we'll find out soon, won't we?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know, I think you're right!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're easily distracted, you know that?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That we most certainly do.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A useless thought is all!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I suppose we shall!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why, thanks!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Good chat!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Look at that lovely sky!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Am not!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Great!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right, then!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Save it, then!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well thanks for sharing, anyway!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's do it then!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm sure she'll wear you down eventually!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who knows? Mother's full of surprises!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Perish the thought of you being less difficult, Father!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Is that your deepest fear of late, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I think you'll get there, yes!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You treat her with respect!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Do not treat her as you allow yourself with me!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ah, how could I forget?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Same goes for you!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Worry about yourself!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Likewise to you!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No plans for that!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Old age, it happens!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You've been so busy!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My chambers just aren't as enjoyable to fight!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What, so they could look like your boring chambers?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Too busy ransacking through your domain, sorry!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Why don't you concentrate on fighting back?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You and your clever wit!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Bah...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You take that back about my chambers!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What would you know of real work?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I ask the questions here!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nope!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"They're boring, I say!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This isn't real work?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just what you've taught me!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Whatever you say!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Really?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That's funny, you wouldn't be here without Olympus, either!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You act like you do everything yourself!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You should be pleased to have their help!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"And what's your point, exactly, there?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Bah, blast you, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
More than you know!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, I'm delighted, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Someday you'll understand!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Blast you right back!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
<Chuckle>,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, cheers!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I know a thing or two!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I can tell!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Clearly!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Ominous!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sounds good!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll leave that one for you to figure out!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Who do you think, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, quite a few of them, I'll have you know!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Certainly not you!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Enough!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
All right!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think it's time for you to die!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Do not pretend to even care!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Well I would beg to differ!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Mm, no thanks!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right, I won't!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Fine!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Last I checked princes were meant to be coddled!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It's called showing affection to your children, Father!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whatever will you do about it, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What do you even care?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, thank you for the information, there!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Please, teach me more, then!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Always such accusations, from you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You impudent...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You impertinent...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're most welcome!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sure thing!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Happy to!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Always!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Quite lovely, Father, how about yourself?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There's a refreshing chill now that you mention it!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh I most definitely am, thank you, Father!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It could be going better, I suppose!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, you know, same as ever, here!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Silence!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Just as I thought!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
And such a shame for that!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You impudent...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You impertinent...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, carry on!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanks for your concern!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It'll be all right!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You'll have to let me know when this is over!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We'll soon find out I think!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm pretty sure it is!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know what, probably not!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Enough!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Silence!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
All right!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"End of discussion, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Bah...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You and your clever wit!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, absolutely wonderful, thank you!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It went all right, now that you mention it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Quite pleasant, actually!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's always pleasant in the Underworld!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How truly wonderful to hear.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It fared just great, thank you for asking, there!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Could have gone better, though what can you do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Not bad at all, this time!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've had better escape attempts I think!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You're very welcome, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I can do this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How truly wonderful to hear.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Losing your spirit, same as ever, there!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Not just yet!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
And we finally have an activity we can do together!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Seems like you have a lot to learn about discipline, huh?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We gods do like to fight!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Discipline, that's what we're calling it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, yes, indeed!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"We've all a lot to learn, I think!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Incorrigible brat!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How thoughtful, there, indeed!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Silence!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think it's time for you to die!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, carry on!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanks for your concern!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It'll be all right!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Path A,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You really think you can just walk away?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You dare attempt to vanquish me, again?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You truly think this surface is where you belong?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Do you even realize what you're doing, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Path B,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why do you keep doing this, time after blasted time?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why have you forced me to confront you here, again?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why do you wish to die repeatedly like this?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why have you come all this way, again?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Path C,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That brutish strength of yours! How like your relatives you are!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You lack the proper form! Pure brutish strength!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Is this another showing of your brutish strength?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Path D,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What shall it take for all of this to end?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What shall it take for you to cease making me face you here?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What shall it take for you to stop this foolishness?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What is it going to take for you to get some sense into your head?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I do!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's right!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What do you think, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I guess so!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think that you are an ignoble brat!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think you are wasting your time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh you'll think better of me soon!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
And I am shocked to hear it!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
And I think you're a miserable failure as a father!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's my time to do with as I please!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I don't care what you think!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh this isn't a waste of time at all!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It beats having to live within your House!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You know exactly why!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Would that you could be useful there from time to time!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You shall never find her! She is gone!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'd like that, wouldn't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Would that you could shut up and fight!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Liar! Why should I trust a single word you say?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No! She's out there. I know it!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You're but a simple fool!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
All that I've told you is for your own good.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"She's gone, I say!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You know nothing!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'd like to perish, wouldn't you?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What would you know of it!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh I can do just that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll happily oblige.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll show you brutish strength!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Not interested in the analysis now, Father!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
And I'll show you the might that vanquished the Titans themselves.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No! You're holding back, as always.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'm not afraid of you!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll have you join them soon!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Am I brutish or am I holding back? Make up your blasted mind!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You want me to go all out? Then fine!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You ought to be.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You impudent...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll make you regret this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Fine!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You have no inkling of what you need.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh I think it's the perfect time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I said shut up with the analysis!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I need you to quit blathering and fight!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh I disagree!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well then, let's hear it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Unfilial oaf!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Happily.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I thought you might!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You'd not listen even if I did!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You know exactly what it's going to take!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It'll take you getting out of my blasted way!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Stubborn oaf!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What you desire is impossible!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Miserable husk of a man!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wretched excuse for a father!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We'll see!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Like you would know!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What would you know of misery?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Such utter disrespect!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We certainly shall!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I do, you idiot!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You cannot talk to me that way!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
No; that shall accomplish nothing.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Well I just did!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
And you cannot treat me this way!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's test that theory!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh I think it shall!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You won't do it again.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll treat you as you deserve.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Happily.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Fine!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I thought you might!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You impudent...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male

"You know what, I changed my mind about the drapery.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I miss the way things used to be, dear Drapery.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The time has come once more to modify the drapery.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Either those curtains go, or I do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A garish hue.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Indecisive as ever.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Make up your mind.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Quit changing the blasted drapery.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Would that you cared about more than the drapery.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The prior hue was fine.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It was perfectly acceptable before.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Back there, let's change the color theming up a little bit.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This color ought to suit the hall back there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This is the color suited for our hall back there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We should redecorate the hall back there like so.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's try this color on for size instead.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'd like to see it in this color once again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This color seemed to suit the hall quite well.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's change the colors up back there again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"By my decree, this House is not a house without this rug.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"If there's a finer rug to set back there, I'll likely end up getting it as well.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should make my bedchambers a little more presentable I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What time is it? That's right: Rug-switching time!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hrm I don't know let's try a different rug.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's try a different rug there, if you please.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've had a change of heart about that rug if you don't mind.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think we both know that it's time to change the rug.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Think this rug's really going to tie the whole room together.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You could make better use of your limitless time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Would that your sense of taste exceeded rugs.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The poets doubtless shall be singing of your rug.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What have you done to my floor surfaces?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It ties nothing of the sort.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Are you quite finished alternating rugs?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Meddling with rugs again are we?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh leave the blasted rugs alone for once.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The lounge could use a decent rug I think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This stately rug should match the lounge decor.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Don't mean to interrupt!!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Come on, you bozos, do it!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I'm here, kill me, you bozos!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Come on, kill me, you goofs!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male

You know who you're dealing with?,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Really...?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Really.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh, really...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That is absurd.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You can't be serious.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You're serious right now?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What an idiot.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What a fool.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Go on.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
And...?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
No...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female

Unbelievable.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You don't want to know what I think.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female

What can you do...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Oh that's too bad.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female

That's unfortunate.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Wow.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Scoff>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You did?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You really said that?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Oh I don't know.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I mean, I guess.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I know, I know.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Look, I...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
It's totally all right.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I understand, it's fine.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"So, then I say...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"And, then I said...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
But you know what else?,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Oh that's not all.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Oh there's more.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
There's more.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"There's more, though.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Oh but get this.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
But get this.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Get this.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
It gets worse!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female

You get the gist.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
...Told you.,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
See?,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
What'd I tell you?,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You truly are an idiot, aren't you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Don't make me laugh.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Do not so much as think about it.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I do not think so, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Who dares?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You dare?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Thief!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Interloper!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You shall pay for that!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You shall regret this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That is private property.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We have an intruder.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Trespasser!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Transgressions are not tolerated.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Consider this a warning.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We have a pest problem.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Death is inescapable.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You cannot escape.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That is far enough.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Wretches of the Underworld, this is your chance.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Come forth, wretches, and stop this meddler.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Do not presume that you escape my notice, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You really think you can get out of here?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's see if you can live through this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nobody gets out of here, whether alive or dead.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're out well past your curfew, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I've tolerated your impudence for long enough.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I see you there.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You think you can just walk away from here?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
If I could have a minute of your time...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's see your relatives upon Olympus get you out of this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Allow me, boy, to introduce some of my loyal subjects.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're not going anywhere.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Champions of Elysium, now prove yourselves!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Come, heroes of Elysium, and vanquish the intruder!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why you...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That does not belong to you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Again with your tampering?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That was ill-advised.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What, again?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
My coffers are not yours for pillaging.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You thief.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Security!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Halt.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Seal the chamber.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There you are.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
He's there. Get him.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What's your rush, there, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
My subjects wish to have a word with you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No need to be in such a hurry, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I thought I'd find you here.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"All right, wretches, get to work!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Stop him, wretches!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Stop him, wretches, now!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You leave my troves alone!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Those troves are not for you!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Get your hands off my trove!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Wretches, take him, now!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Remain exactly where you are.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll give these wretches not a minute more.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How foolhardy of you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You lot, huh?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Come and get it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's make this quick.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No time to lose.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Enough!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Worthless wretches.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Pah, useless.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Blood and darkness.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
They had their chance.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I shall deal with you later, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You lived through all of that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Who is going to clean all of this up?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Idiots!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Worthless!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Useless!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Damnable fools.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It seems I need to look for better help.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Back to the lowest depths with them.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Enough, I've better things to do.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Kkh, you waste my time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"All right, break it up!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That's all the time we have.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Bah, that's enough!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Decidedly below my expectations.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Work faster next time!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
No more of this buffoonery!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I expected more from the Exalted.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Disappointing for these so-called Champions.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why do I pay these wretches.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That's quite enough.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fine, help yourself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You did not earn this, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nrgh, how many times...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
There. Satisfied?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ugh, why do I bother.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I should not be the supervisor here.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fine, get out.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Again you make a mockery of me.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I've no more time for this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Out, all of you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Utterly incompetent.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I ought have left them all in Erebus.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I trust they inconvenienced you at least.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why do I even bother.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Every time!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Incompetents.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Pah. Fine, go!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fine, go, then!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Time's up!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"All right, all right!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Yes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Yes...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Simple.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Easy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No problem.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No problem!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There we go.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How's that?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How's that!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What do I get?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Short work.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Whew.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hoh?,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Hrn?,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Hehh?,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Hraugh!,CHARACTER,Charon,male

Haaah?!,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Rraah!!,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Hrrnn!!,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Wha, that thing, that's... the sun...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
So... bright... ugh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's... I...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
So much water... Uncle Poseidon's realm,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mother isn't far...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Huh... to see this each day...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...Beautiful...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...The Sun...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...The Sun... Helios...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles thinks that I'm the... god of blood?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Patroclus... so that's his name.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That shade... that was Patroclus...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This one, Contractor. Ought to make the Underworld a better place, I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's make it happen. I'll have to keep an eye out for this next I'm out there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I like the sound of this. Work approved and here's the fee, good Contractor!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Here you go! I'll be on the lookout for this when I'm in the area.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Here! The Underworld could always use a little extra renovating, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I like the sound of this one here, good Contractor. Go make it happen!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Work is approved, upon my father's name! Not like he's paying any heed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm hereby authorizing this expenditure! And I look forward to seeing the result.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"House Contractor, my good shade, I've yet another job for your distinguished team.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's go with this assignment, Contractor! My father surely would approve.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This looks to be an excellent investment, Contractor! Go on and make it so.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The ever-shifting chambers of the Underworld ought be a little livelier with this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Contractor, I would ask that you pursue this job. I'll be excited to see the result!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Your asking price, good Contractor. Well worth the fruits of your hard work, I'm sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Since Father's not paying us any heed, what say with go with this assignment, Contractor?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I grant you funding and autonomy to do this job upon your earliest convenience, Contractor.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right! If this isn't a good expenditure of resources, then I don't know what is.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"On my authority, I'd like it if you did this job for me, is that all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
All set.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Paid in full up front, let's see what we get!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"House Contractor, I have a new job for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right, House Contractor, go do your thing.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's lighten things up a little around here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's see how this one turns out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right, let's see what we got.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This should help liven the mood a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
One more embellishment for the old House.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You've done so much for us, House Contractor. Why don't you do a little something for yourself?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"If that mess of a table enhances the Contractor's productivity, then so be it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Work authorized! A fountain chamber in the depths of Tartarus sounds like an excellent idea.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The more I know about the Boons I'm offered, the better off I'll be.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You won't be better off, believe you me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What is this...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"If my father can be even more frustrating, that's something I have to see.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, you are in for it, now, boy...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hey that sounds handy, there...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Approved! Wouldn't mind an extra helping of gemstones while I'm ransacking out there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You wish to mine my realm for gemstones, be my guest.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Sign me up, Contractor. This ought to pay for itself in no time at all!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Counting on resources you have not yet earned?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What's that, there, something from the Fates?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Fated List of Minor Prophecies... that sounds somewhat exciting, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, a Rod of Fishing? Here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I positively cannot wait to see what sorts of foul creatures I'll dredge up with this!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Cheap blessing from Poseidon on a stick, and nothing more.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Access to the administrative chamber, huh...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father always said if I wanted privileged access again, I'd have to earn it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Do not touch anything again in the administrative chamber.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hey that's the Court Musician's sentence, long past due...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There we go!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"In the name of Hades, I commute our court musician's sentencing, effective now!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, um, hello.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Ah, Orpheus.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"A sealed document, regarding Sisyphus?",CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
The Sisyphus contract. I can buy it out...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"In the name of Hades, I hereby release Sisyphus from the terms of his pact!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You what? All this, just for that wretched shade.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Orpheus' contract. I can release him...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"In the name of Hades, I hereby release Orpheus from the terms of his pact!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What, where did you unearth that blasted contract?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
It's the revised Achilles Pact...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"In the name of Hades, the shade of Achilles is hereby no longer barred from visiting Elysium!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Such leniency with binding pacts shall tarnish our good reputation at this rate.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There's Nyx's work order...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"House Contractor? With this gift of Darkness, I decree the Eldest Sigil shall be restored!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You waste your time; the Sigil shall never work for you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How very thoughtful, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Hey that's new...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This ought to help Orpheus keep his boundless libraries of music in order. Just have to fill it in.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, my...",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
Our court musician need not be so indulged.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hoh, what's this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This style reminds me of the surface. Good motivating factor!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You spend exorbitant resources on festoonery?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Have to admit, this style really suits me, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll have no part in paying for such things.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This style's a bit formal for my tastes, but I can get used to it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You wish to throw away your gemstones, fine by me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
They say this one's the hottest style this side of Elysium.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Who are these self-appointed judges, I would like to know!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This style seems appropriately grim for the job, I think",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Are you quite finished with your decorating yet?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Soon as I saw this lovely style, I knew I had to have it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It would be lovely if you let me work in peace!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'd like to think Master Chaos would approve of this style.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Your resources to waste the way you please.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I rather like this style, so let's go ahead and make it official.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"To trifles such as that, in times such as these!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I rather like this style, so let's go ahead and make it official.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"To trifles such as that, in times such as these!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If I'm to keep seeing my chamber walls, they might as well not be completely barren.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Why don't you clean your chambers rather than adorn them?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hey, they're my bedchambers, I can have whatever wall-scrolls I want.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
If that is how you wish to spend your wealth.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
My mate Lord Dionysus can inspire me to keep a bright and healthy attitude toward life.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hahaha, healthy attitude? From him?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseWryLaugh,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Should help make my messy chambers even messier.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should make a nice enough addition to my chambers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Least we have a backup singer if we need one.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Think I've outgrown my other bed, not that there's been a lot of time for sleep of late.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You do not need another blasted bed!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Anything to liven things up even the slightest bit around here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think those columns still could use some sprucing up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The columns were just fine the way they were.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Was thinking it'd be good to change those columns up a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Those columns are for function not for show!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If anybody needs to see their own reflection down the hall, well, now they can!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Heh.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Reflect upon your many failings with that, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Leave that poor Contractor alone.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Let us hereby have better seating, on which I shall never rest, you mark my words!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hrm.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It seems my princely duty to commission this fine portrait of myself!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I ought have named you Narcissus instead.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Since this is Father's House it's only fair the walls be slathered with his sour look.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You dare to thusly mock me, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Wonder how they got Meg to pose with the other two. They look downright civil!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You wish to see the Fury Sisters, go to Tartarus.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nyx deserves a place of honor around here. How about... right over there on that wall?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nyx surely is unwanting of attention such as that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Every self-respecting House needs a portrait of a girl from Crete.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Another tastelessly constructed piece.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
This piece has the power to embarrass several members of this House all in one swoop.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I much prefer the walls to remain bare.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh gods, am I becoming hopelessly obsessed with Theseus...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You'll never be a match for such a champion.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'd like to see the depths of Tartarus adorn those walls back there!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Why don't you go see Tartarus firsthand?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
This artful piece of terrifying Asphodel should add some atmosphere.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What are you doing to my hall up there?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A painting of the finest spot in all the Underworld seems suitable to have in here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Why settle for a painting when you could just go get yourself killed there, now?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
This thought-provoking piece seems like a decent conversation-starter for the hall.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What is that utterly preposterous design?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A hideous rendition of a grizzled skeleton seems suitable decor.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
May it strike fear into these worthless shades.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Father always wanted a sundial, though that aside, let's have a sundial back there, posthaste!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Perhaps the mystery of whether it's day or night around here will finally be solved?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
So be it.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"A sundial, at last? Indeed?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think those pedestals over there are just a bit too modest for my tastes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hrm, I do suppose that gold suits those sufficiently...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If Achilles is going to stand around eternally, it might as well take place on something soft.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Ah.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"He is a shade, boy! What use has he for supple carpeting?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh I think Thanatos would love this one. Or totally ignore it?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What is this, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thanatos is far too industrious to require such a thing!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Should soften up that corridor down there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Heh.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thanatos has no need for such embellishments!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Where else is Thanatos going to stash loose odds and ends?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Here, Thanatos, why don't you have yourself this little table?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This can't be...,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
What use has Death Incarnate for such things?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's lighten up that southwest hall a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
The prior dimness of that hall was entirely intentional!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Perhaps Death Incarnate would like to take a load off every now and then.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Appreciate that.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thanatos would never sit down on the job!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What is it about fountains that makes everything feel a little fancier?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Really?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
What good shall that do all the way down there?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I've not seen the famous Heracles about, and so, let's have a marble effigy of him, instead!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Daedalus ought stick to chamber work.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Always hoped we'd have fountain here precisely in that location.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah yes, more comfortable seating I shall never use.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'd better not catch anybody sitting down on that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Think this is going to be a better look for the lounge seating.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Green is perhaps last among the list of colors I would have selected!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think the lounge will be better off for these tables here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There were no complaints on record of the prior tables!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The Head Chef certainly is going to need a place to safely care for all the fish I've been hauling in.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Last that I checked, this was not Poseidon's domain!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"A fine display of dead meats seems very much in theme, I have to say!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You ought to be displayed with all the rest.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Who am I to stop the shades there in the lounge from cooking up whatever it is they're making?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whew. It's a big job, having to sweep up after Cerberus sheds everywhere.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It wasn't your fault, Cerberus.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blame yourself for that, not Cerberus.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
This ought to make the lounge a little more presentable. Until Cerberus wrecks it again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Finally you cleared the mess you caused.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Should make the entryway into the lounge a bit more welcoming.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I welcome you to go about your business, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If some big light-refracting orb won't fill the lounge with revelry, I don't know what will.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Blood and darkness, what have you done now?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Now this is just the sort of outlandish purchase that makes me briefly feel slightly better about myself.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I pity those who have depended on our lounge for its formal, understated atmosphere.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
These adorable little creatures forced to live in a cage ought to lighten the mood.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, hey.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Those bats are for reconnaissance not for your mood!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It can't be eaten, as I understand, but it can be displayed for all to see!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I see you're cultivating quite the mess.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Cerberus won't touch these things, although some shades seem to enjoy them fine.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The comfort and the safety hazard of a roaring fire seems the perfect touch for our fine lounge, I say.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Go cast yourself in there, why don't you, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What are we supposed to do with that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"At least somebody will enjoy it around here, even if it's just a painted skeleton.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Would that you were a painted skeleton yourself.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
This seems a suitably fine resting-pad for Cerberus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The dog is perfectly content such as it is.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"For Cerberus, only the greatest bed will do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't you disturb the dog, you hear me, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"For Cerberus, only the greatest bed will do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What do you think the dog shall do with that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Maybe this knitted effigy of some sort of surface creature will keep Cerberus occupied.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Cerberus has much better things to do than play with toys!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If Hypnos is going to be sleeping on the job, he ought to do it in the lap of luxury.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hypnos has an important job to do!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I won't be needing these but anyone emerging from the Pool of Styx might like them I suppose.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A fair enough adjustment I should say.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A marble bust of some old man seems just the thing to liven this place up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Exactly whose unwanted countenance is that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
These undead flower petals ought to add an extra touch of elegance I think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What are you doing to my central hall?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Let's get some undead flower petals over there, posthaste!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The hall to Father ought to look more sinister, I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A fair enough adjustment I should say.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Can't have too many undead flower petals around here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"A bit more mood lighting in the main hall is certainly in order, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The light of Ixion is bright enough.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I would like only the brightest-burning, most ornate fireplace available, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There is sufficient warmth already in that hall.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
This elegant countenance should look perfect above a roaring inferno in the hall back there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You'll not be burning down this House, you hear me, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The climate in this House is perfectly attuned as it is!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
These ought to add a little sparkle each time I revive from the Pool of Styx.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Such an ignoble way to step into this House needs no adornment!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think we can spruce up the centerpiece of the great hall just a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This is my blasted hall, rather than yours!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You look a bit uncomfortable, Father. Here, why don't you have a seat?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What, what happened to my... nrgh, another of your foolish pranks.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's set some decadent old tombs right smack in the middle of the hall back there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The dead need not be coddled with such things.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A nice floral arrangement ought to lighten up the mood a little bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You are too kind.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You would associate my House with flowers, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'm sure nobody's going to mind some lovely flowers there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It is appreciated, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"That is no place for flowers, clean that up!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
An intricate mosaic just above my bedchambers should make having to go in feel less bad I think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No mosaic shall eliminate your shame, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nothing like a mosaic depicting my arch-enemy and the Bull of Minos to spur me on.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Do give the champion of Elysium my best regards when next you're slain by him.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
This should instill a sense of fear in anyone approaching my bedchambers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What you do with your wretched bedchambers is your business alone.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Should make the climate in the lounge a bit more comfortable for some of us.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You wish for warmth, go visit Asphodel.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
There's not much on the menu in the lounge but maybe this will help.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This one's for all the solitary shades hanging around forever in the lounge.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Now I suppose no work will ever be complete.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Huh maybe I can use this to avoid Father's withering gaze and unwanted feedback.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You think you can avoid me through there, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
These decorative laurels ought to give us an appreciable touch of dignity no doubt.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You would squander your earnings on that?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I swear, who would purchase laurels, when they could earn them in sporting competition?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Only those with pure contempt for honest victory.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Perhaps my chambers will look even better with these blades ominously displayed on either side.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Those blades don't even work. No wonder you prefer them so.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You know I've always had a thing for double-bladed axes?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've always had a thing for silence around here!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I have this crippling compulsion to commission objects I am never, ever going to sit on.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
None shall sit besides myself and Cerberus!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"They say that only Heracles himself can lift these things? I'll take them, then!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You think you have the necessary strength?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Always wanted my own entertainment table, and I can finally afford one, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Keep entertaining yourself, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
A bottle of nectar.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sweet nectar.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nectar bottle.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Some nectar there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That Nectar also amplified one of my Boons.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who should I give this to...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sweet.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Perfect.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Looks like a good batch.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who doesn't love this stuff.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The perfect gift.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That a genuine Ambrosia bottle there?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
An Ambrosia bottle...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Huh, I can't seem to open it...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Must be something I can do with this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Someone back home would practically die for this stuff.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Look at this...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What a find.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A souvenir.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Ambrosia.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Very nice.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll just help myself.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The good stuff.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Fit for a god.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's a Skeleton Key...,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
It's a key...,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
A Chthonic Key...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That key, it granted me Fated Persuasion.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That key, it granted me Fated Authority.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wonder where I can use this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This can unlock a weapon back at home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I can use this to unlock a weapon.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This can unlock something back home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A key to a weapon...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should be useful.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should come in handy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll just keep this on me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
One for the stash.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's one more.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How many have I got now?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Another key.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A key for back home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I can use that back home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, it's food!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
All I got was that stupid onion.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
An onion.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
An onion. Great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Father's famous sense of humor shining through again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I was robbed.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Really...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
An onion. Instead of... whatever I was supposed to get. Ugh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Five-second rule. That was five seconds right?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Disgusting.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I don't like it, but I'll eat it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Eugghh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Buuuhhh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Yuck.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Acquired taste I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
At least they peeled it for me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oy...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mm that was terrible.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mm that was... not bad.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, it's food!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A Centaur Heart...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That ought to keep me going for a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Strength of the Centaurs.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Yes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Better.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Good for the health.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's a relief.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Much better.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's better.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I feel stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Feeling stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Feeling good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Feeling tough.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Centaur strength.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Vitality.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's life.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should keep me going.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Coin from the dead...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Gemstones.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Assorted gems.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There they are.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
For my trouble.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Extra gemstones...! The Vanquisher's Keep.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Gemstones, and a little extra for Charon.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Never enough of these back at the House.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Colorful.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll take 'em.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

I'll hang onto these.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Ooh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Aw, for me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Should fetch me something good back home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got some heft.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's brilliant.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's beautiful.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll just tuck that away.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The ancient blood...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles might know what to do with this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This holds some sort of power, but for what?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Stygius shuddered as I picked it up...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I felt Aegis shudder...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Varatha shuddered just now...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

My weapon shuddered at the touch of it...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My weapons can grow even stronger now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This can unlock a hidden aspect of my weapons.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I look forward to making use of this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Appreciate your generosity.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Looks like I'm back in the club.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Look at these savings!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What a deal, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's a deal!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Nice place you got here, boyo! Name's Skelly, how's it going, but enough with the small talk already, I'm here to do a job. So let me have it! Give me everything you got!!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I don't remember having you on payroll, mate. Who's your supervisor?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh-hoh, I'm not about to rat my sources, pal! Just try and beat it out of me!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Don't suppose I can talk you into fighting back this time?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not a chance, boyo, I'm paid to take it not to dish it out! Now give it to me!!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Hey, you're getting pretty strong, there, pal! Though, I am being paid to tell you that! But not being paid to not tell you that last part...",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I have to ask you something, mate. What do you even need the pay for, anyway?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusExpressiveEmpathy,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That, pal, is nobody's business but my own! Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time! Now back to beating me to powder!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Let me give you a piece of advice, boyo. You run across a guy like me out there, you just give him a good stab right in the back without a second thought before he sends you crying back to Papa.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You getting pretty strong, I'll give you that, boyo. Strong enough to smack a guy like me right up against the wall and I'd go straight to pieces, boom! You just remember, when you're duking it out, the walls are your friend!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Smack guys against walls. Sound advice as ever, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey pal watch where you throw those bloodstone things of yours, you drop them, you go pick them up, you understand? But if somebody gives you grief, you got my permission to chuck one right in his eye!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I'll just aim generally for the midsection since the eyes are a lot harder to hit in my experience.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're pretty quick, you know, boyo! Just be sure to use that fancy dash of yours and keep 'em guessing! Don't let 'em catch you standing still!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Dash like mad instead of standing still. That's not the worst advice, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Little tip, boyo? You find any coinage while you're out there, you be sure to pawn it off to that old Charon, boatman guy? Use it or lose it, pal, use it or lose it.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Thanks, mate, note to self: Always spend everything I earn instead of ever saving.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Once in a while, pal, you're going to see a real fancy bozo try to ruin your good time. You'll know him 'cause he's glowing like a light, but that's his special armor, see? You got to punch right through it, he's going to shrug you off until you do!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"For a good time, beware the fancy glowing bozos on my quest. Check.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know something, boyo, I think you could do a real number on one of these columns holding up this place, and bring the whole thing down in just a few swipes, boom, boom, BOOM! I'd hate to be standing near one of them if you did!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Wreck my father's finely crafted architecture every chance I get. That I can do for sure.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Boyo, next time you make it to the big VIP area upstairs, you watch out for those weapon-wielding gents out there! The eyeball soul thing that pops out when you beat 'em? You got to squash those, too, or else they'll grab their gear and come right back!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Crush the souls of Elysium's Exalted shades to stop them from regenerating over and over. I'll definitely do that next time I'm there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Exactly, pal, that's it!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"If you're having a rough time out there, boyo, you just remember something: You're a god, all right?! Way tougher than you think. They give you trouble, you just turn on God Mode, and you let 'em have it for me!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You act as though this God Mode is some sort of lever I can simply switch at will if ever I wish to unlock my latent strength, there, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
If I must.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Skelly, how do you know all this stuff, by the way? I mean no offense, but you're a skeleton who just stands around. Yet you have this wealth of knowledge of the Underworld?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, I know people, pal! We'll just have to leave it at that. Now let's see you break some of these bones, huh?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Yep. Now hop to it!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Well, pal? You have come a pretty long way, let me tell you. I think most of the smarts I've picked up, you know by now. And so... if I'm fresh out of tips for you... I guess there's only one thing left to do.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Stand there eternally to be whaled upon at my whim, using whichever weapon suits me at the time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah, no, that definitely wouldn't fly.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Say, mate? I picked up a painting for our lounge that looked a little like yourself. Reminds me... have you ever even been inside? Should come join us sometime.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, you know, while I appreciate that, there, boyo... those kind of social spaces, they're not really for me. I kind of like it out here, just me, these bats whizzing around from time to time.... Besides! The old contract makes it pretty clear I got to stay right here.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
What if I picked you up bodily and brought you in? Contract have anything to say about that?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Got to say, you're really getting somewhere, boyo, I'm pretty impressed here! And they don't even pay me to do that, I'm just supposed to stand around!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Appreciate the vote of confidence, mate. Maybe you're right and someday I'll get out of here. Hey, if I never come back, you won't just be stuck here forever, will you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heh, hehehe, that's a good one! No! Probably not. Wasn't anything in the old contract about that... huh.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Appreciate it, Skelly.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hitting a wall out there, boyo? Hey I know the feeling. You just keep at it, though! You're getting tougher, getting smarter... between the two of those, I'm thinking you'll pull through soon enough here.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Come on, mate, won't you say who hired you? Was it Achilles? Couldn't have been Nyx...? Is it that big a deal?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I am an individual of some integrity, boyo, and protect my sources with my life! You'll have to kill me if you want to make me squeal!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Hrm.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Say, uh, Skelly? How'd you get here, anyway?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you know, just kind of zapped right in, like Papa lets us do! Some of us sometimes. Why do you ask?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I meant... how did you get to the realm of the dead, in the first place. Lord Hermes whisk you to the entryway? Thanatos scoop you up, Charon give you a lift, what?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, haha! Well, that's a little personal, don't you think, boyo? I... I don't like to talk about it much. So, if I could have a little privacy...?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Oh, hahaha, but I do!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Skelly, is it really true you don't want to talk about how you got here? Just curious who you used to be. What you were like. Your real name.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, what makes you think this isn't my real name, pal? I'm offended!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Sorry, what I meant was... I was just interested to get to know you better, after all you've done to help. Anything you can share? Trade you for a detail about me!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Well all right... I was once a commander of men. Name of Schelemeus. Captain of the Cretan second fleet, sailing on Athens under King Minos. We were unstoppable... but then one day... one wrong turn... and we sailed straight into the waters of Charybdis.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Skelly, that's... that's incredible! So then... you and your crew, you perished at sea?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I, uh, pfff, hahaha, boyo, you are something else, you know? All that Schelemeus stuff, I could have had you eating out of my hand for days!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Oh, I get it. You got me. Fine, then, Schelemeus, but I don't appreciate the trick.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yep!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Skelly... I'm serious. You really won't tell me anything about you? You're just going to leave me to speculate, forever?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Argh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hahaha!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Say, Skelly... or should I say Schelemeus? I happened to have a chat with somebody familiar with that name. Large bull-headed fellow originally from Crete. You said you made it all up! What's going on?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Never said I made it up, pal! I just knew you weren't going to believe me, I mean, look at me! I look like a captain of the Cretan second fleet to you?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I don't know. I've never met one. Do they all just stand around doing nothing?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, sounds like somebody's never had to lead like fifty-or-something sailors in a voyage across the sea in a Minoan galley with nothing but the stars to guide 'em! What do you think the captains do, pull the oars?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Wait, what about Hermes? He gave me the impression you might have been somebody else. Nobody in particular. Not some great sea-captain.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What is it with you gods talking behind the backs of all your friends, boyo?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Don't change the subject!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Don't change the subject!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Fine. Maybe.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That Lucky Tooth you gave me, Skelly. First off, thanks again, and secondly... is this even yours? Had a run-in with Hermes, who got me thinking.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, haha, you going to believe everything that gabby guy tells you, now, boyo? He doesn't know a thing about me!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Never said he did. Though since you let on... what's your relationship to him? Working for him?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No! Nope. Definitely not working for him, closer to a peer relationship. Well, other than the fact that he's a god and I'm just... well, what you see is what you get with me, pal. Hey, you won't tell anyone, will you? I'm just here to help, I swear!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
OK.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right, fess up, Skelly, who are you working for? I know it's not Achilles. It's not Nyx. Dusa has no idea who you are. My father... no way. Hypnos? Give me a break. So the House is ruled out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sorry, pal, my lips are sealed. How about we change the subject?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
How about you tell me who your sources are?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Nope!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Tell me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No way.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Tell me!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I said no!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Tell me, Skelly.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nuh-uh.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Come on, tell me, please?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No. Means. No.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Why won't you tell me?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nice try, pal.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
What if I never hit you again?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Uh... no...?,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"So help me, Skelly, if you don't tell me who you're working for, there will be no more violence between us, ever.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No... please, have mercy, boyo...",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"No mercy, Skelly. Tell me. Or else... it will be only pleasantries between us from here on out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nrrrghh, all right! But you got to promise me something, promise not to let on or tell anybody in your fancy House, all right? Or else I'm done for. I'm serious!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I promise. So...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...It's Charon.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Charon! Huh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah. He's rich. He's got connections to guys like me, and I think he's got a horse in this chariot race you've got going on around here with Papa.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
What's his angle?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No idea. Maybe he likes you, maybe he's bored.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"And Hermes... he's working for Charon, too?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Yep! Now, let's pretend like none of this ever happened, so I can stick around, all right? Remember, pal, you promised!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"If you did, pal, I would not be here right now!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Skelly, did you tell Charon and Hermes about our little conversation from before, about your sources? Because, I didn't tell them, but... they seemed to know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Boyo, thought we agreed we weren't going to be having conversations on the subject from here on. Spares me having to spill my guts with my sources later.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I didn't get you into too much trouble, did I?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Appreciate you answering!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Skelly, what with everything out in the open now, with the Queen and Charon, and all that... mind if I mention some of this to Thanatos? Charon's his brother, after all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Yeah, now that you mention it, I guess that part of the old contract no longer applies. So, go right ahead! Appreciate you asking, pal.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Hahaha, sure!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Pal, thanks again for that Nectar bottle from before, stuff just goes right through me like you won't believe! Though, I hope you're not going around giving that stuff away to every bozo you know.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"What, Skelly, you worried something bad is going to happen if I express a bit of generosity from time to time through our somewhat-illicit gift-giving custom around here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, I'm worried you'll be wasting your time! If you give that stuff away, don't expect to get anything back. Well, not after the first time, anyway. Usually! I'm just saying... don't get your hopes up.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Maybe I just want to show thanks to my friends for its own sake!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Skelly? You look like you know your way around Tartarus. Found some of this ancient Titan blood out there, and I was looking to score some more.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, you've come to the right place regarding that, there, pal! It's your mean weapons back there that can find the stuff. Once you get all the way through Tartarus with one, that's all the blood you're going to get! For the time being anyhow.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"How am I supposed to keep track of which weapons I've earned these with, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know, there's always the invention of writing stuff down? You'll figure something out.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Unlock those first, then, huh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Skelly, you mentioned the ancient bit of blood I found in Tartarus. Know what I'm supposed to do with this stuff?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wouldn't know a thing about it! Definitely doesn't have anything to do with those Infernal Arms of yours, some of which appear to still be unavailable to you, as I understand?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"That's an imaginative theory, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I should go check it out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So the strangest thing happened while you were out, boyo! One of your weapon holder things back there, it picked up this eerie glow! Could see it from the corner of my eye!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Calm down, Skelly. I'm sure whatever it is is perfectly normal for a legendary semi-sentient Titan-slaying weapon from the dawn of time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's just it! Those weapons of yours, they have seen some real business, pal. You're giving them a real workout, so maybe they're starting to like you or something? Loosening up a bit, you know? Like you and me!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Uh... sure.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know, pal, when you're not around and it's just me and all your weapons, I mean your Infernal Arms right over there, between us they are making me a bit uncomfortable.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Can't blame you, mate. I wouldn't want to be stuck in a chamber with a bunch of legendary, quite possibly malevolent killing artifacts. Anything I can do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I didn't mean it like a bad thing, boyo! The weirder you make those things, the more it gives me the shakes, and keeps me hopping like this nice and steady till the next time you get back! So, thanks!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"All right, maybe I will.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Say, Skelly? Don't suppose you'd care to tell me how the infamous Twin Fists of Malphon came to be right here in this very courtyard, would you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nope! Not any of my business, pal, which is to say, I didn't see a thing! And even if I did, it isn't what I'm paid to do! Don't you have someone in your fancy House there paid to keep watch over stuff like that? Ask them!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I miss my fancy sorcery already.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, just want to say, pal, that spooky crimson phoenix stuff that you were going on about before? I mean, whoa, you just say some nonsense and you get a brand-new spear? I was so impressed, I decided to try that trick for myself!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Oh, gods... Skelly, what did you do...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Relax, boyo, just had a little chat with your old serving platter over there after you left, is all. That thing hits pretty hard! So, then, I say to it, I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix... and you want to know what happened after that?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"So you carelessly spoke secret words imparted by the Fates themselves to an infernal weapon forged at the dawn of creation, then what? Say, did you walk up to Aegis, or just shout over your shoulder?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Over my shoulder! Anyway, what happened next was nothing! Your Aegis kept on bobbing like a dummy. So then I went and said that mumbo jumbo to every other weapon, but nope! Doesn't work at all. So much for your fancy sorcery, huh?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
As likely an explanation as any I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, what exactly happened with the formerly pink window over there? Now it's got these sinister orange flames and an enormous Pact of Punishment hanging ominously over the exit. Father stop by?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Pal, I don't know a thing about it, honest! I was just minding my own business, when all the sudden, wham! I get hit right in the back. I fall to pieces, no idea what's going on! When I finally come to, the window job was done...!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
All right... maybe.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Listen, boyo: I don't know exactly how to put this, so I'm just going to come right out. I need your help with something, and, I'll be honest, I don't think you're going to like it.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"If it doesn't involve hacking away at you with reckless abandon, Skelly, I don't want to hear it. But... oh. You're being serious.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I am. And funny you should put it like that. Boyo, I am asking you to get me out of here. Permanently, if you catch my drift. This standing around stuff... just kind of wears on you, after a while, you know?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
...I know. I can only imagine. Tell me what I can do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That blade of yours back there. It's got a special power. You got to spruce it all the way up. Your Aspect, not somebody's else's. Then let me have it with that thing... and I'm out of here.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Then you'd be dead, forever? You're asking me to kill you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know it's a lot to dump on you, but I got my reasons. I don't exactly have a lot of options, here, so... give it some thought. Till then, we'll act like nothing's changed, all right?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
All right... maybe.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Listen, boyo: I don't know exactly how to put this, so I'm just going to come right out. I need your help with something, and, I'll be honest, I don't think you're going to like it.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"If it doesn't involve hacking away at you with reckless abandon, Skelly, I don't want to hear it. But... oh. You're being serious.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"That blade of yours back there. It's got a special power. Your Aspect, now that it's maxed out. You got to let me have it with that thing... and then I'm out of here.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Then you'd be dead... forever? You're asking me to kill you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I know it's a lot to dump on you, but I got my reasons. I don't exactly have a lot of options, here, so... give it some thought. Till then, we'll act like nothing's changed, all right?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Sure looks that way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Huzzah!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"So, uh, pal? My sources tell me that you made it pretty far. Which means... my usefulness is coming to an end.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Your usefulness, what, you just mean the standing around, letting me lay into you with whatever vicious attack sequence I fancy at the time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yeah! Once you achieve your goal... my contract's up. You won't need me anymore.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"But only if I leave for good, isn't that right? So if I stuck around... you'd stay here, too?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Probably, but... wait, you're really going to stay?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
It better be.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So Mama's back in town from what I hear, boyo! It's awful nice knowing I trained you well.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Erm, you must mean the Queen, and evidently you're aware of our relationship. You keep that quiet, understand, Skelly?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, and thus the pupil trains the master, for a change! I hear you, pal. Your secret's safe with me.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Same here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You must have had yourself a real bash, with all those fancy gods and stuff! Could hear all the festivity from all the way out here. How was it, pal?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"It... went better than expected, all in all. I hope you didn't feel left out! It was a pretty limited guest list. Kind of a diplomatic mission, I would say. Not quite as good a time as it might have sounded from the outside.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ohh, don't you even worry about me, there, pal! I much prefer the solitary life, and besides! When things are good for you, they're good for me. Glad everything worked out.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Less yakking, more smacking, boyo, now come on!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Less chatter, more batter, boyo, hit me already!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Less talking, more socking, here, pal!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Come on, boyo, less gabbing, more stabbing over here!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Less prattle, more battle, boyo, give me all you got!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Can't break these bones, pal, what you just try it!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You want another a piece of this, or what?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Enough with the small talk, boyo, hit me, go on!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Trying to bore me to death with all this chit-chat, pal?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"This look like a shoulder to cry on to you, boyo?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Let me have it already, boyo, no holding back!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Let's see what you can do in terms of hitting me, pal!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You could be hitting me right now, boyo!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Sure could go for somebody just whaling away on me right now.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"What's the matter, you gone soft or something, pal?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You going to hit me over here, or what?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Go on, boyo, give me your best shot, it's my job!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Sure could use a good smack in the jaw from you right about now!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You want to fight me, boyo, well hop to it, stat!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"What do I look like, pal, some kind of conversationalist?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Our relationship, boyo, requires no exchange of words!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"For you, mate! Thought you might get a kick out of this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"For me, pal? Awful nice of you, just awful nice, but guess what, I got this for you! Tit for tat, you understand, a deal's a deal!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Whoa-hoh, you being serious here, pal? You brought that all this way, for little old me?! That's real nice of you!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You're not so bad yourself, mate. Thanks for always being here for me to savagely attack without a second thought.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whoaaaa, now get a load of what you got there, boyo! Wait, really, that's for me? Or you just pulling my leg?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I'm really giving this to you, mate. Now go enjoy it, will you? Once I've finished pummeling you some more just for the sake of it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heeey now that's what I'm talking about, thanks, boyo! Won't forget you doing me a solid like this, cross my heart!!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"No need to thank me, mate. But don't you dare forget it or I'll attack you repeatedly and without mercy.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh look here, pal, I can't just keep accepting these from you! Not when they're paying me already, I got standards to uphold, you know?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I will look the other way if you do, mate. Now, here! Or else!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Haaah, you're kidding, what? Sometimes, boyo, you make me feel alive again, you know that? Being honest with you here, I'm grateful, really.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"If not for you, my friend, I'd have no one to viciously attack with no fear of reprisal whatsoever.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Skelly, while I know your services have already been paid in full, your sources ought to know you've been doing an excellent job. So much so, I wanted to give you this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whaaa, is that a vintage bottle of Ambrosia, pal?! I never even thought I'd get to try a thing like that, I mean, what am I, here? Know what, I want you to have this. To symbolize our friendship, and in case you ever need a hand out there.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Hah!! Nope!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Drat.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hope you enjoyed that vintage bottle of Ambrosia last time, Skelly, because I got you another. Here!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Aww, no way, boyo, you kidding me right now? Why are you even, I... look, I, I just stand around and let you beat me up, you don't have to do this. You don't even know who I am. Who I was.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You're my friend, mate. That's all that matters. Although... I don't suppose you're willing to divulge those types of details? Just out of curiosity.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well great, I guess!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know, Skelly, I still cannot entirely get over that whole permanently-kill-you stunt you pulled on me. You had me deeply worried for a while, all for just a laugh?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Yeah, that's right! Not exactly much to do here, case you hadn't noticed recently! Good thing I'm able to stay occupied with intellectual pursuits.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"That's what you call it, then? In any case, I did want to make sure: You sure that you're all right, having to stand around like this?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You kidding, pal? This is the life! Imagine getting paid to stand around! And being pals with you!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Hahaha, got you pretty good, again, didn't I, boyo?! I am asking you to get me out of here. Hahahaha! All that stuff about your blade, and your Aspect, I mean, you ate all of it right up! Woo, hoo-hoo!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"It appears I've been the victim of an elaborate prank. Not sure that I appreciate it, Skelly. What if I were to never hit you again, how would you like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa, whoa! Now come on, boyo, it was just a joke, I figured things could lighten up a little here. Don't need to do anything rash!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Skelly, mate... this what I think it is?",CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
"Skelly, mate! You really shouldn't have. Do you have any idea how hard-to-find this is?!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Cheers, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Felt all three points on that spear, pal!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Hey that shot felt different somehow!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
You been messing with that shooty thing pal?,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
More of a slicing feel there rather than a stabbing!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Yeoow that's got a nice little kick of heat to it!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Hooh now that's what I call getting shot by arrows!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Ah, yeah, that's the stuff!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male

I hope that hurt.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You and your dirty tricks.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Hah!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I can beat you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Slowed you down, have I?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Give Hades my regards.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What...!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Zagreus...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Come then.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Do your worst.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How...?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What is this.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What's gotten into you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
So...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How did you?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How did you...!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
This again.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You're angry.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You have no self control.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Control yourself.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Fight me yourself!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Need help against me, huh?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Calling in favors again?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Calling for help?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Nice trick...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
This again?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Come on, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Not this again.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Oh no.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You'll need more help than that.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Thanatos, here?!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"What is this, Than?!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Get out of here, Than.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"This isn't your fight, Than.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Thanatos, again?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Thanatos!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Thanatos?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What is the meaning of this?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Who is this idiot?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I didn't summon you!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How did that get in?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Odd friends you're making, Zagreus!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
It's that damn skeleton!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"The skeleton, again?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Sisyphus!!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Sisyphus?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"How dare you, Sisyphus?!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It can't be, Sisyphus?!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Damn you, Sisyphus!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You blasted wretch!!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"How could you, Zagreus!!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're going to be sorry, Sisyphus!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Dusa?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Dusa!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Dusa, here?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Dusa, how?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"What are you doing, Dusa?!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Get back to your post, Shade!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You shouldn't be here, Shade!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Achilles?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Achilles!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Achilles, here?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Achilles, what?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"What is this, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Fight me yourself!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Can't handle me yourself?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You again?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You again!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I told you to get out!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I said stay out of this!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Get out of here!!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Don't interfere with this!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You are not authorized to be here!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Don't you have someplace else to be?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
We got him.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
We are the Furies.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Our work here is done.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
He had no chance against us.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"We got him, sisters.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Got him, Alecto. Good.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Stand down, Tisiphone. He's done.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"He's finished, Tis. Well done.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're mine and always will be, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're mine, Zag. Don't forget it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
We'll have to finish this back home.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
It's all part of the job.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What else did you expect?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You could do better than that, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Were you distracted maybe, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Don't get so careless with me next time, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Thanks for the little workout there.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I guess I'll see you back here before long.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You almost had me there.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Finally.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Give Hades my regards.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You should have known better.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I think we're finished here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I finally got you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I got you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"About damn time I finally got you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That took me long enough.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Revenge is always sweet.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I finally got you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Did you go easy on me, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Did you just let me win...?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Give Hades my regards.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You must have let me win.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Your heart just wasn't in it... why?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I'll take what vengeance I can get.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
The Fates were on my side for once.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're out of practice, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Get out of here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Finally got you for once.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You better not have given me this one.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Still got it in me after all this time.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You'll never beat me, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Don't you know when to quit?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Give up, already, damn you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'll kill you next time, too.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Must I keep doing this?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You just can't take a hint.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'll kill you again, and again, and again.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Your shining relatives can't help you here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Next time will pan out just like this.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I'll send you back as often as it takes.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Got you again like in the old days, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Beginning to see a pattern, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'll never hold back, for you or anyone.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Go home, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That's what you get.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Hah! Idiot.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
There! Now get out of my hall.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You're nothing to me anymore.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Give Hades my regards.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You should have known better.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
To hell with you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Get the hell out of here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You stupid little fool.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Megaera,droppedMale
I think we're finished here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Finally.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I finally got you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I got you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Do not come back.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Stupid fool.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You little fool.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Do say hello to Nyx for me.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Drown in the River Styx.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
We're through.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
We're finished here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Do something with your hair?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You look different somehow.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What did you do to me....,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What in the...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Quit messing with my heart...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Have you been working out?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What is going on...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
This is embarrassing...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Dirty trick...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Oh no...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Bastard!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You bastard!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You little brat!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You brat!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How dare you!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You dare?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Why, you!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That hurt.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ungh, you!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Pfah!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Tsch, heh.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That all you've got?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Am I supposed to be impressed?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What else?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Pfah!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Tsch, heh.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Augh, hahaha.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Oh-hoh...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Not bad.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Really.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Hmph.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That's it.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Not yet.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ungh, heh.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"How thoughtful of you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You can do better than that.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That's it?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Is that all?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
My turn.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Mm.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Really...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Nice shot...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Damn...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh, come on.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Really, Zag?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Damn it!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Damn you!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Curse you!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Blood and darkness!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Not again!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Enough of this!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That does it!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Enough!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Urgh no.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Gah, hrngh!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Augh damn it!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
No...!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
No!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How...!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How...?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What...?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Impossible!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I can't!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Again?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Not again?!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ungh, damn...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Damn you...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ngh, blood and",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Lord Hades, I...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Sisters...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Why, you...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
This is...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How could I!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Absurd...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Why...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Nggh... not... bad...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ungh, heh heh...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Guh, got... me...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Unghh! That was...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Kh!! Keep... go...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
No! You're... good...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Ngh! Every... time...!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Mmph! Well... fought...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ungh, you... can't...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Augh, can't... be...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Guh, fine.... then....",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Sisters... go...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Sorry... sisters...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Ughh... Alecto....,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Guh... Tis, I....",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Don't... like... you...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Ngh... not... yet...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"My sisters and I. We've had a chance to talk, and we have come to an agreement, Zagreus. As you can see.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Megaera, Tis, you ready?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Mmurdererr!,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
"Three against one. Doesn't seem all that sporting, now, does it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We're each well past the need for any sport. We'll kill you, whatever it takes. Erinyes! Now.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What's the matter, Zagreus? You look a bit uncomfortable. Something you want to say to me? Or any one of us?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well, it's just... there's something that I wanted to discuss with you, at some point, Meg, but after more consideration, I am thinking maybe now is not the time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I understand entirely. Though you should know my sisters and I keep no secrets from each other, anymore. Isn't that right, Sisters?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Eugh, I almost want to thank you, Zagreus. I thought you'd never change that blasted Pact, and leave me here, in peace.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"What, you mean you aren't lonelier without Alecto's or Tisiphone's companionship? They seem so wonderful to have around.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
They're tolerable each to some extent. About as much as I can say for you. Now let's the two of us begin.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"See, Alecto? He is right on time, just as I said.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Megaera, bleed him!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heads up, Tisiphone. I think I found a murderer for you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Mmuuurrrderrrr...,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
TisiphoneTaunt_2,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have to level with you, Zagreus. For all we've been through... never once have I wanted you to meet my sisters.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I can't imagine why not! We had a lovely time getting to know each other. We laughed, we cried! My only regret was that you couldn't be there, yourself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You don't know what you're saying. There's a reason that they're not permitted in the House. Though, come on. One of us is going back there, now.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You've really done it, Zagreus. My sisters have returned. All three of us now share the same assignment.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Is it wrong of me that I am somewhat honored to have garnered the attention of the Erinyes?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I would say it's very wrong of you, indeed.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I sense something different about you, Zagreus. Your old weakness. Ah... the Mirror. I thought you said you weren't trying to compete with me?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I wasn't. But then you gave me a good idea to try. I'm not as weak as I once was. With or without the Mirror's help.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Is that so? Well then let's see if you're correct. Come on.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I heard that you escaped. Then, what are you still doing here? Forget something along the way?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You know... I think I'd rather fight you to the death again than try to answer either of those questions, right now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know what you're up to, Zagreus. But I guess it doesn't matter, either way. All that matters is you're not getting past me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your mother has returned to us, already, Zagreus. And still you're going to keep battling your way out, past me and everything up there? Why?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Father says there's no escape from here, and I like to repeatedly show him he's wrong. Besides, I think getting out there a bit from time to time does me some good.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sounds like you've found yourself a steady line of work. Most jobs just need doing. If this one gives you some fulfillment, stick to it. Now, come on.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What is it that you're up to now, Zagreus? The Queen is back. But still you're making me show up like this?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Got some unfinished business with the Olympians to take care of, was in the area, figured I'd say hi. Hi, Meg!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't start with me. You show up here, we fight, somebody dies. That's it. Now, who's it going to be?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Been seeing an awful lot of each other lately, haven't we. You had enough of me, yet, Zag?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Never enough, Meg. You ready for another go at it, too, I take it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Always. Although I do like to keep things fresh, so... surprise me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Listen to me, Zagreus. Your mother is long gone. You're never getting out of here, and even if you did, what hope could you possibly have in finding her up in the world out there?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I've hope enough. Not that it's any of your business anymore.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Your family is here. And so is your responsibility. You're running from yourself. Though, I can slow you down a bit I think.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What... where did you get the Rail? Do you know what you have? Where are your customary weapons?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I left them at home. And, I sort of know what I have, inasmuch as it's largely responsible for getting me this far. Would you like to see a demonstration?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, I would. I always have, as a matter of fact.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What's that you're holding, Zagreus? Please tell me that you didn't steal the most dangerous, unstable artifacts sealed shut within your father's vault.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Erm, it wasn't I who stole them, if that's any reassurance to you, Meg!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You are a hopeless fool. You cannot possibly know what you're doing with those things. You put them back exactly where you found them.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Nyx really let Dusa go?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
She did... so you heard. I don't know what happened. You didn't even get a chance to say goodbye?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No. Damn it. If you had anything to do with this...! Even if you didn't, come on and die!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What have you done with the Pact, Zagreus? This isn't even Asphodel, and I can barely tolerate the heat. Do you really want to die this terribly?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Appreciate all the concern, but I just thought I'd live a little, Meg. You ought to try it for yourself, sometime!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ought to try watching your mouth. You want a swift and painful death, you'll have one momentarily.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Halt, Zagreus. Not one step further.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Come on, Meg. Haven't we had more than enough of each other by now? Besides, don't you have someplace else to be?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know exactly why I'm here. Now shut your mouth, and come die like a man.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Halt, Zagreus. Not one step further.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Come on, Meg. Haven't we had more than enough of each other by now? Besides, don't you have someplace else to be?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your father sent me. All in all, I'd rather be on your bad side than his. Now you can turn back like a good little man, or I can send you home the painful way. What'll it be?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
...I'll have to go with the painful way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
A man after my own heart.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tell me something, Zag, because I'm curious. Do your Olympian relatives know the real reason you've been trying to escape?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I'll get around to that in due time. They're family. They'll understand no doubt.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're in over your head, you idiot. You'll fray what bonds are left between Lord Hades and those ingrates on Olympus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Things can't entirely be different between you and me. You know that, don't you, Zag? Not when it comes to this, at least.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I do. We wouldn't both be consummate professionals if it were any other way. You won't be going easy on me, will you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'm going to pretend you didn't ask me that. Now give me everything you've got!,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What is it, Zagreus? You've got that pleased-with-yourself look, which can only mean you have something obnoxious to tell me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I never! Look, I'm simply pleased to see you, Meg. Hence the insuppressible smile. Could have been one of your lovely sisters here instead...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're not going to throw me off my guard that easily. My sisters wouldn't let me hear the end of it.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And where, exactly, do you think you're going, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I think I'm going all the way to the top again, Meg. To find my mother. You won't stop me. Get out of my way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We both know that's not going to happen. Getting out of your way, I mean.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your mother, Zagreus. You really think you'll find her once again, out there? Even if you make it out... maybe she's found another hiding place.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It isn't us she's hiding from up there. Father let her go. He never wanted to go after her. So I appreciate your concern, but I'll find her again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That sounds like information neither one of them would want for me to know. You know the punishment for spilling secrets, don't you?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What are you doing, Zagreus? The Underworld is sealed off. What you're attempting is impossible. You've seen what happens when you go too far.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"This place can't stay sealed shut forever, Meg. In the meantime, I thought I'd get some practice in, you know?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm not your practice partner, fool.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"May I help you with something, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Now that you mention it, you can, Meg. I was wondering what was Father carrying on with you about back home?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Eavesdropping again? If you must know, my job performance is under review. Though, I'm sure this job's about to go just fine.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I sincerely hope that you enjoy these meetings with me while you can. I know I will.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Now that's a rather ominous thing to say to someone, Meg. Care to explain in terms an idiot like me could understand?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Lord Hades is exploring other options. He has no confidence in my ability to stop you anymore. Though, maybe it isn't too late for me to change his mind.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's been a while, Zagreus. You must have made it pretty far last time. Let's see. Outer reaches of Asphodel?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Outer reaches of Asphodel. And I have to say, Meg, you are positively a sight compared with that blasted Bone Hydra stewing away up there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How very flattering, to have compared me to the remains of some mindless outsized lizard. Come, maybe I'll kill you just as easily as your new Hydra friend.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How many times have we been going at it like this, Zagreus? You tired of me, yet?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"We're both immortals, Meg. We'll be seeing plenty of each other for a while yet. I've come to welcome these occasions.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, good. Lashing you across the face beats waiting for the opportunity to do so. Come.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I heard what happened. You crossed the River of Flame. You really did it.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"That Hydra was a total bastard, though. Bastards. But, you sound practically impressed with me, there, Meg! I feel so flattered!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You'll soon feel something else. I don't know how you did it. But it changes nothing.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How utterly disgusting... I was just counting, Zagreus, and as it happens, I have lost to you fifty times, already! If not more. Can you believe this? Ugh, how I've fallen.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh, don't take it so hard, Meg! Once you die several dozen times, you start to get accustomed to the emotional pain, as well as the physical! Up for some more of either?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Of course! Who do you think I am? Although I guess there's no use keeping score with you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know how many times you've beaten me, here, Zagreus? Can you even guess?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Erm... feels like a lot, admittedly, I mean, we've been going at this for a while, now. Four hundred and twelve times...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Five hundred times, exactly. Though I figure, you haven't been keeping track of how many times I've killed you. Ugh, maybe that's my problem. Well, plenty of time to work it out after this.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You beat Alecto, Zag. Could hear her screaming her head off about it all the way through Tartarus... I almost want to thank you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I almost want to say you're very welcome. Have you and she always been on bad terms like this?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
We have long-standing differences. It's worse with family. You know what it's like.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Huh. Not even Tisiphone could stop you. Your father must be sorely disappointed.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"He's difficult to please, that much is true. What happened to Tisiphone, anyway? She isn't much for conversation.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It runs in the family. Tis only knows her work. And, professional distance is important.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If there's anyone in all the Underworld who owes you, Zagreus, it's your friend, Sisyphus. He would be much worse off if not for you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"What, because I've been distracting you from administering lashings like before? I hate to think you prefer to whip with no fear of reprisal whatsoever, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Dereliction of duty and fear of reprisal are not one and the same. Though you don't seem to be concerned with either one.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your weapon's looking rather dull, there, Zagreus. Great Daedalus decided not to grace you with his gifts this time around?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Now that you mention it, he hasn't, no. Though I'm prepared to say I don't need special augmentations to get past you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, we can put that to the test right now. Just remember, you need all the help you can get.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That Mirror's made you stronger, Zagreus. You're fortunate to have Nyx helping you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
No hard feelings. I think she feels partly responsible for all of this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
She shouldn't. The only one responsible for all of this is you. And I thought even you would have understood that by now.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Tsch. I can't believe it. You signed the Pact of Punishment. Have you completely lost your mind? Or just trying to insult me?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well if you're going to be so rude about it, maybe a little of each? Though, what do you even care which pacts I sign or don't?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm not an idiot. I see what you're doing. You want to be punished? Then, come on.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch. You really volunteered into a Pact of Punishment? You can't back out of it, now. You're even more of a fool than I already thought.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Maybe I just like a challenge, ever thought of that? Besides, what do you even care which pacts I sign or don't?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're right. I don't care. You want to be punished? Then, come on.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I have been longing for a fairer fight with you. Maybe that's why you signed the Pact? To pity me?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I have my reasons. Pitying you isn't one of them. Although I guess you don't believe me, do you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If it's punishment you want, how am I to say no?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You know I can hit even harder than usual with the Pact of Punishment working against you. Maybe that's why you signed it? To pity me?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I have my reasons. Pitying you isn't one of them. Although I guess you don't believe me, do you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, I don't think I do. Come on, then, and let's see where all your pity gets you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This should be over pretty quickly, I think, Zag. Never took you for the Forced Overtime type. That's not a Pact condition for the faint of heart.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You wound me, Meg! You know I like to barge into situations thoughtlessly and recklessly, and sort everything out later. Forced Overtime's the perfect fit!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, well, when you put it that way. Look, don't go saying I didn't warn you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hold it, Zagreus. I sense something, is that... ah. You've been in contact with Chaos. So even they are now involved with this.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Just because Chaos is giving me the power to crush you doesn't mean they're getting involved with this, does it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You don't know who or what you're dealing with. Ask Nyx about them for me sometime. Here, I'll give you a chance to ask her very soon.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I know that Thanatos assisted you in getting to this point. I don't appreciate his interference.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I'm sure you'll have a chance to tell him back at home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He has domain over the wretched shades, but his power has no sway with me. And neither does your own.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I still cannot believe that Thanatos is helping you. I mistook him for someone with integrity.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You mistook him for someone who blindly follows orders without considering the implications.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How dare you...! If you like death so much, then here, let me indulge you. Thanatos will welcome you with open arms.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prince Zagreus, you are trespassing beyond the limits of your authority. I am under orders to stop you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Come on, Meg, why so formal all of a sudden? We've been through this countless times. Wait, is it because...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, come on, Zag. Will you just learn to play along, for once? Come on and fight me like you mean it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What is it, Zagreus? You look a little hesitant to go another round with me. Or is it my imagination?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well, it's just... can we really keep the personal and the professional completely separate like this, Meg? It's with mixed emotions that I fight you to the death, only to be happy to see you back at the House.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then learn to keep your emotions in check. You keep them bottled up a while, they'll be that much stronger when it's time to let them out.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nice gloves, there, Zagreus. Think you can take me up close with those things? Well within striking distance of my whip.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Not wearing them for fashion's sake, here, Meg. You won't mind if I give you my best shot with Malphon here, will you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'd mind if you didn't. Want to get your hands dirty, fine. Let's see it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What happened to your weapon, Zagreus? I sensed its power long before you turned up. That isn't just some Daedalus enchantment on it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh, Stygius and I have been getting much more closely acquainted lately, Meg. Would you care to see the fruits of our healthy symbiotic relationship?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You, in a healthy relationship? Why yes, then this I have to see.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nice earring, Zagreus. Maybe I should have thought twice before giving you a thing like that.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Why, because the gift you generously gave me may end up being instrumental in your own demise? Sounds straight out of one of those tales the mortals like to go spreading around.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They like it when best-laid plans fall completely to pieces, don't they? You better grow to like it, too.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I sense something of death upon you, Zagreus. What's that you have, something from Thanatos is it?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh, this old thing? It's just a listless butterfly Than gave me, which happens to fill me with even more supernatural strength than usual. Don't pay it any mind.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not even Thanatos can help you here. But if I ever start a bug collection, I'll know who to call.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know Battie's not going to work here, don't you? I'm definitely not going to help you out of this one.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Come on, Meg, you can do anything if you set your mind to it! Though, don't worry, Battie's just here for the show.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, let's make it a good one. Come on.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your little bat companion not too much to handle, is she, Zagreus? I trust you're taking excellent care of her. Not that she needs your help.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh she's been positively perfect, thank you, Meg. Especially in how she puts us into contact when I need a hand. I hope it's not too much hassle, helping out from time to time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you were hoping to avoid a hassle, you've definitely come to the wrong place.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look at yourself, Zagreus, you are a total mess. Halfway to death or worse. You're making this too easy.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Hit a few snags on my way to meet you, Meg. So, if you wouldn't mind going easy on me this one?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not on your life or death. But I will kill you quickly, how's that?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're wounded, Zagreus. How unbecoming of a god. Not to mention that I have the upper hand.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I figured I'd give you a head start this time, so I let the wretched shades bludgeon me repeatedly along the way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Fool. If you're half-dead already by the time you get to me, what hope can you possibly have for what lies ahead?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You look like you had trouble getting to me, Zagreus. Did you try asking for directions on the way?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You sound like Hypnos. He's getting to you, isn't he. Isn't he!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You shut your mouth right now, with that. Come die.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're not escaping death this time, here, Zagreus. You ready to go home?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"No, not just yet, though thanks for asking, Meg. If you intend to force me, know that I am going to resist, with all my might.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Well I appreciate the warning. Now prepare to die.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ever stubborn, aren't you. Maybe my whip might make you reconsider whatever it is that you're attempting here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Your whip's not been all that persuasive in the past.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Maybe persistence will pay off for both of us. Come, then.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
And there you are again. Lord Hades ought to lock you up rather than let you run amok in his domain like this.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'm sure he'd welcome all this feedback from you, Meg. Or maybe you're just pining for my father's job?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have no envy for your father's position. Besides, I happen to enjoy my own responsibilities.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, there you are. Just as I was beginning to think it's been too long since last I killed you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Admit it, Meg. You can't stop thinking about me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Don't flatter yourself. I think of you in pain. And now there's no more need for the imagination.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Zag? Any last requests this time before I send you home?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Let's see, how about a swift and painful death, would that be possible?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Be cheeky all you like. You'll get exactly what you asked, and nothing more.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Pff. And here you are again. You're slow to learn the way of things I see.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I may be slow to learn, but... least I'm rather patient!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This talk about your patience is beginning to test mine. Enough! Come on and die.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Give up already, Zag. Or I'll keep killing you each time you come this far.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I have some bad news for you, Meg. Little by little, I'm getting stronger.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That may be so. But you will never be my equal. Ever. You'd do well to remember that.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're never getting past me, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
While that's probably the case... maybe I will this time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Keep telling yourself that. Maybe it'll help take your mind off the pain that is to come.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Even if you manage to get past me, there's no getting out of Asphodel. You saw what it was like. You really want to go back there?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It's not a matter of want. The way out is there in that direction, past the river of flame.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're more stubborn than your father. I never thought that such a thing was possible.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Finally, you're back. You won't get past me like you did last time. Though, I would like to see you try.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Zag? May I have this dance for old time's sake?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready for me this time, Zagreus? Come on and fight. No holding back.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I guess we know the drill by now, don't we. Not that I don't enjoy our little arguments, in my own way.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's here, Alecto. Tis. Let's get him, now.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prepare yourselves, Sisters. And you, too, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Together this time, Sisters. Go!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Alecto. Tisiphone. Our guest is here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's here. Let's get to work, Sisters.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Sisters? We have a reputation to uphold.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready, Sisters? There he is. Now, on my mark.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, Sisters, let's show him what we've got.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Alecto, Tis, he's mine. Just back me up.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No time for further talk, now, Sisters. Take him, now.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No quarter now or ever, Erinyes. Attack!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Are you ready, Sister? Let's take care of him.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come, Sister, it's time to get to work.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's here, Sister. Let's go.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's him. Prepare yourself, Sister.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Alecto and I were just wondering when you'd arrive.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"See, Alecto? He is right on time, just as I said.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You see, Tisiphone? He's here, just as I said.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heads up, Tisiphone. I think I found a murderer for you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Let's go, Sister. Together, we can take him.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Well, Sister, we'll have to finish catching up some other time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I wish it didn't have to be this way.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Why must we always have to fight.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It's time we had one of our little fights.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I so was hoping you'd show up just now.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now that you're here, how about a little dance?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
How about we go once more for old time's sake?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready for me, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
And here I was just wondering when you'd show up.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And there he is at last, the Prince himself.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You've come to die to me again?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I killed you last time, I'll kill you again.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I guess you want to die again?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It seems you haven't learned your lesson yet.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I hope you'll pose more of a threat this time.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You don't seem to learn. Then, come and die.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You aren't getting past me, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll never stand aside for you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm back again, and I'll keep coming back.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You'll get past me over my dead body.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'm never going to back down from you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I guess we know how this is going to go.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm pledged to stand against you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I will keep coming back, the same as you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I will not stand aside for you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't know if I can stop you anymore, but I can slow you down.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll get you back for what you did last time.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"One of these encounters, you'll let your guard down, and I'll kill you again for old time's sake.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Even if I can't stop you... I can get a few good hits in, I'm sure.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've got a lot of payback to administer here, let me tell you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ungh, I've practically lost count how many times you beat me in a row here, Zag...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I thought you might show up.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're right on schedule.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No need for small talk, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Up for another fight I see?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What say we get things started.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready for me, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Come on and show me what you've got.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Let's go, then, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm ready for you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not one step further, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I can't just let you off without a fight.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's you again, is it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come all this way again, just to see me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Get on your guard, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're prompt sometimes, I have to give you that.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Halt, Zagreus. Not one step further.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come for another round with me, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Let's see if you can make it past me, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No hard feelings, Zagreus. And don't you dare hold back.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"One thing I like about you, Zag? You're always right on time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I hope you're ready for me this time, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't think I'm going to go easy on you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know it's strictly business here between us, don't you, Zag?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I expect you to give me the best you've got, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you so much as think of going easy on me, Zagreus, I'll kill you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No holding back against me, Zagreus. Certainly not here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You'll find I don't grow weary of these run-ins with you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You know I can't just let you walk away without a fight.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You won't be getting out of here without a dance.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There's nothing you can do to hurt me, Zag. Though I would like to see you try.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm starting to enjoy these little outings with you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come on, Zag. Come at me with everything you've got.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do you want me, Zagreus? Then come and get me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll give you one thing, Zag. You never keep me waiting very long.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're looking pretty good, there, Zag. Though let me see what I can do.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No pleasure without pain, right, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That's it!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
That's it!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
That's it!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
Now you've done it.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
"What, Thanatos?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You bastard, Thanatos!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Get out of here, death god!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Not your fight, Thanatos!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Thanatos, again?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Thanatos!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Thanatos?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Do I know you, dead man?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
This idiot again?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I didn't call for you!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
How did he get in?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Some friend you got, redblood!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
That skeleton again!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
What in the hell was that?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I know that damn boulder!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
The hell did that come from?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You need some help, redblood?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Fight me yourself, redblood!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Can't handle me yourself, huh?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You again?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You again!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Get lost!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Stay out of this, I said!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Get out of here!!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Oh don't you mess with me!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
The hell you doing here?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
We got him.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
We are the Furies.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I guess we're finished here.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
He never stood a chance.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Come back again sometime!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Until the next one, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"That never gets old, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You know, I can get used to this!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You don't have what it takes, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Try not to waste my time again, hm?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Finally, whew.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Was just a matter of time I guess.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
We fury sisters do like our revenge.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
About damn time I got my way with you.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You better not be going easy on me, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"That was a sloppy fight even for you, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Get out of here, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"See you next time, you trash.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You're just like Megaera.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I told you what was going to happen.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Go on now back to daddy.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Bye now, see you next time!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Aw, we were just getting started.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Right down the drain with you.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
"Aw, over so soon?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Another piece of trash goes down the drain.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Tell Daddy I said hi.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Finally.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"All right, all right, that's enough.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Satisfied? I am.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Try harder!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Weak.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female

That's it!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
My turn.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
That does it!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Now you've done it.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Graahhh!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female

Enough of this!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Why, you!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Enough!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Whew.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Whew!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Nrrgghh...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Mmph.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I don't think so.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
Not a chance.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
Nice try.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
No way.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
Pshh.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
Really?,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Alecto,droppedFemale
T'hah.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You trash.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Piece of trash.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Tsch.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Tsch, heh.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Huh.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Pff.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You little.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Really.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Really?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Felt that.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Ow.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Not bad.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Pfah!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
How dare you.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Gah!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Damn.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female

Urgh no.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Augh damn!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female

Urgh.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female

Damn you...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Argh, how!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Aw, did that hurt?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
How was that?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
That was nothing.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You're bleeding.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Remember that.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I'll make you scream.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I'll hurt you worse than that.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I feel your pain.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I'm going to kill you.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I'll kill you yet.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You'll die!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Die!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
T'hah!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Nrah, haha!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Like that?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
How's that!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
There!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Want more?!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Bleed!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Oh we're not done!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
That hurt?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You trash!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Still standing huh.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Die already.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Still kicking?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Still kicking are you.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Still alive huh.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I said die!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Ooh, you're hurt.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Aw, you're hurt.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Not finished? Fine.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You're as good as dead.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Nice trick.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Give up.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You're dead.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You're mine.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You won't last.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Got you that time.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I bet that hurt.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
For last time.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Hah!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I'll get you yet.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Hurts, doesn't it?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Interesting...!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Oho, hoh...!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Angry now?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Guess I hit a nerve.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
What's the matter?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
So...!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
So...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
What the,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
What the?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Huh?,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Whoa.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Easy, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Ooh, you're mad!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Relax, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You ready, Megaera? Tisiphone? Let's go.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Check it out, Sis! The god of trash is here. Let's get to work.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ugh, would you just look at him! That smug look, that posture, everything! Please tell me you're not going soft for this trash-god, Sister.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Come on, Alecto. When was the last time that we looked to one another for approval? Besides, as long as we kill him, what do you even care?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You know, fair point, there, Sister! Very nicely said. Let's kill him, now!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look at this awful piece of trash, come here again to bleed all over our nice shiny floor. Ready to fight my lovely sister, there, redblood?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"He's not so awful once you get to know him, Sis. Not that it matters for what we're about to do.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"The both of you disgust me, Meg, you know that? Get it together and kill him this time, damn you!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You must have gone and signed a Pact! Isn't that right, redblood? Tell me right now.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Well, as a matter of fact, I have. Though I don't see how that's any business of yours, Alecto.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I like working alone! And you don't see me doing that, right now, do you? So I would say it's my business, all right. Along with killing you!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whew, I thought I'd never get some quiet time again, you know, redblood? That damned Pact you stupidly agreed to, making me work with my sisters again. I'll get you for that!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"I'm sensing a pattern that it really doesn't take much for you to have something to get me for, does it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that's rich! How smart of you, you're smart! Know what? I'll get you for that, too.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, hah hah, hohohohohhh. Finally. I've been waiting for this! Really.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You must be one of Megaera's lovely sisters, I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Waiting for what, exactly?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...So sick of, you know, doing my regular job, uninterrupted. Not having to clean up Meg's messes!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
I get the feeling we're starting off on the wrong foot.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Anyway. I always wanted to kill a god. You'll have to do.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heard rumblings about some news back at your daddy's House, redblood. So his illustrious abducted Queen, she's come back home?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Wait, how do you even know all that? And should you really be talking about the Queen that way?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't answer to her! She can come and go as she wants for all I care. But you want to know who can't?! Yeah, you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I got to ask, how come you keep on showing up, redblood? I thought you would have had enough beatings by now.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Well, you know, I've come to enjoy these visits with you so much, Alecto, that I've made it something of a regular routine. Form good habits, and then stick to them, I say!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You call this a good habit, huh? Maybe for me, it is. Well, come here all you like, and I will be here waiting, every single time! About once every three times, anyway.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heard you had a real bash down in your daddy's House, redblood. So sorry I couldn't make it. Next time, though, all right?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Next time, definitely, Alecto. We missed you for sure and wish you could have made it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hohoho, I'm sure you did. But, you know, work comes first! So let's get busy.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, redblood. I have done a lot of thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that I want you never to speak to me again. Ever. Got that?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"...Erm, I don't know how to respond to what you said without directly disobeying your request, Alecto. But for future reference, fine, I'll bite.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You'll die! There's no use standing here flapping our gums when we could cut to killing one another right away. Come on!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, look at you, redblood. You're practically already dead! Now that's no fun at all.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Sorry to disappoint you, Alecto. I know you enjoy being responsible for a hundred percent of my bloodshed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that's all right, no hard feelings at all! You just be sure to get in better health before next I get to kill you, hm?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You know I smelled your blood from three chambers away? Hope you saved some of it for me.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"I've saved some of my blood, yes! Though I was thinking I'd hang onto it for now, if you don't mind.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do I look like someone who doesn't mind, trash god? I'll take your blood, however much you've got.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What's the matter, redblood? You look a little paler than usual. Been bleeding much, having to get this far?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"I ran into some setbacks, if you have to know. But don't worry, I'm sure I've plenty left to bleed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh whew, that's a relief all right! I was so worried that I wasn't going to be the one to kill you this time.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're looking pretty beat already, there, redblood. So let's finish you off.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Next time, don't you go losing so much blood before you get here, trash! I like to take it out of you myself.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're no god! You're nothing but a piece of trash. Born into all of this. And you don't even want it!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You seem to have me all figured out. And here I thought we were still getting to know each other.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch. Well. You want to know what I want? Here, I'll show you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You know what I like about you? The way you bleed. Mmm.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"That... is not the type of flattery I'm used to. You're making me a bit uncomfortable, I'll have you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Never met a god that bleeds like you. Red. Like a worthless mortal. Come on! Let's bleed you dry.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Let's get to work, redblood, what do you say? Me, I say you've kept this girl waiting long enough.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Well, I say I don't appreciate you calling me redblood. You're making me rather self-conscious about it, you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hoho, you're funny. But you'll break. They always do.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have got to admit, you are really frustrating, you know, redblood? What is it going to take to make you scream, hm?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"What, you mean to say Meg never told you? And here I thought you two were close.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ehh, we'll find out. I've got plenty of ideas left I've been meaning to try.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know something, redblood? In retrospect, I should have known this wasn't going to be a quick job.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
They say both gods and mortals are notoriously poor at estimating how long it takes to get anything done.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Normally when I'm on the job, they grovel, then they scream. They shut up eventually, but not you. At least, not yet.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh! You really must like pain an awful lot, redblood. Or maybe it's just me.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"You see, Alecto? Turns out we do have a common interest after all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Did you just? Don't you ever compare yourself to me again, you trash. You want more pain, I'm happy to oblige.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've got a lot to be thankful for, you know, redblood? Your daddy could have shut you in the lowest pits, and then we never would have met!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Perish the thought, Alecto. What would you have done with yourself if not for all our fated encounters?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know! I mean, before we met, I flayed all sorts of other trash down here! But lately I've been keeping them waiting, because of you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Good job, redblood! You made it all this way! But, I have got to send you back to daddy, now. Nothing personal!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Wish you could join me, Alecto. Want me to put in a good word with Father next time, so you can come visit us at the House yourself?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you know, I'd rather have my eyes put out, but thanks for offering! Now, time to head on home.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, redblood, my appointments usually don't come to me, much less again and again! Think I'm here to show you a good time, huh?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Alecto, I just like to see you menacingly smile. And, hey, having to deal with you now and again beats having to fight Meg all the time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Whaa?! You think dealing with me beats dealing with that weakling? Graaaah!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How many times is it going to take, redblood? How many?! Tell me! How can you stand running into me like this, over and over?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Well, habits can be hard to break. As for how many times, I've really no idea. Though I guess there's one way to find out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll give you one thing... I like it when my prey bites back. Come on, let's see some blood again.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tisiphone's started to say the strangest things, lately, redblood. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Oh, don't fret. I was just trying to help her expand her somewhat limited vocabulary.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Stay out of her head!! You really think she's got something to learn from you? Learn to shut up from her!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Eugh, still can't believe Megaera got mixed up with you, redblood. For all her weakness, I always thought at least she took her job here seriously. Eh, live and learn!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Not interested in your nasty remarks about her, Alecto. Though if you keep them up, I'm warning you, I might get mad.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ohh, you might get mad? Defend Megaera's honor, since she's far too weak to do it her damn self? You think she's so pure! Hahaha! You're disgusting! Both of you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh hey, redblood! You're back for more. I like that stubborn stupidness about you, honestly. If only I could keep you alive even longer this time.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"What, you planning to kill me with insults this time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Haven't decided how just yet. This girl likes a little spontaneity.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Huh! Normally my marks don't make a habit of seeking me out again after I'm through with them.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"I can imagine that, it's just, I've really come to appreciate these little back-and-forth exchanges that we have.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ugh, I do so hate to let you down like this, redblood. But you're just not my type. Maybe I'll finally get it through your head this time.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Know something, redblood? Try as I might, I still have not forgiven you for beating me last time. Call it a crippling character flaw, I don't know...",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Forgiveness can take time. Though self-reflection is a healthy step. We're making progress!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You think we're making progress? Here? Ah, hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, ha-hah, why you piece of trash! I'll show you progress.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Redblood, I'm getting awful sick of seeing your smug face, time, after time, after time.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Have you given any thought to just... leaving me alone, and going back to wherever it is you came from?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You see? That is exactly what I mean. To think that Megaera had to put up with you for, I don't know how long.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Damn you for this, redblood. You're making me look bad, you know? Making me feel bad.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Alecto, I didn't ask you to repeatedly attempt to kill me. How did you expect me to respond?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah-hahah-hahaha, hahah, you do know what happens when you make me feel bad, don't you...?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh, it's the god of trash, come once again to filthy up this place! You're getting real predictable, you know.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Considering I beat you last we met, I'd be much more concerned with your predictability than mine.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't want to hear it from you, trash! Just want to see you bleed. Now you come here!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ohh, there he is, sisters. It's time to get to work.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready, Megaera? Tisiphone? Let's go.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Let's tear him into shreds, sisters, come on!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, check it out, sisters, he's back. You ready?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's come crawling back again, sisters. Let's get him, then.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, sisters! Don't screw this up for me!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm taking point against this trash, sisters. You back me up.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All three of us against this trash, sisters? All right!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
The three Furies up against the trash god! What a fight!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hohohohoho, look at him, sisters! Don't you just want to whip him all to shreds?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Much as I love chatting with you, Meg, Tisiphone... our prey is here.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready, Sis? This redblood's nothing to the both of us.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Check it out, Sis! The god of trash is here. Let's get to work.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Sis, what do you say we get started on him?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There he is, Sis! I'm ready if you're ready.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, Sister! Let's rip him all to shreds!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ready for him, Sister? I most definitely am!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're never getting through the both of us without losing a lot of blood, trash god.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My sis and I, we're going to tear you limb from limb, redblood!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Think you can scoot right past the both of us, trash god?!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, Sis! You just back me up against this trash!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll just keep killing you, redblood. Not that I mind!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What are we going to do with you this time, now, hm?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm impressed, redblood. You really never learn.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Turns out, killing the god of trash never gets old.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How would you like to die this time, redblood? Here, let me guess.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You just don't get it, do you? Though I bet I can make you learn.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm getting real sick of you, trash god. Come on!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bad news for you, redblood. I like dying.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come on, redblood, let's see you kill me again!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're stuck with me forever, trash. Remember that.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm really starting to hate you. You know that, redblood?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Why if it isn't the god of trash himself. I'm so honored.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Good news for you, I'm in a real bad mood right now.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Been looking forward to this chance to get you back, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heard you were in the area, and thought I'd take another stab at killing you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Redblood, I really don't appreciate what happened here last time.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You might get through me, trash god, but I'm going to spill your blood before you do!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Long as I slow you down, redblood, I've done my job.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You think just 'cause you got through Megaera, you'll get through me?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Your daddy never should have given Megaera this job.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Megaera couldn't make it, redblood, so it's me and you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hah! It's Megaera's hot mess. Let's clean you up.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You got Tisiphone, so what. Now I'll get you.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You mess with Tis, redblood, you mess with me, get it?",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tisiphone's been having problems with you, huh. Let's see if I can help.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nobody messes with Tisiphone but me, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm going to enjoy this, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Just when I was beginning to feel bored.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm going to tear you limb from limb, redblood.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
AlectoTaunt,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

These warriors again!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
The fiend has help!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"Bah, fight fair!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Of course you need help!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
What is the meaning of this?,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You again!!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Preposterous!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
What is this?!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ah, drat!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"Step back, Asterius!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ah, blast!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Move, Asterius!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

The blasted fiend tricked us!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Augh, watch yourself, my friend!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Thank you!! Thank you!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
The adoration of the crowd!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Hear that, Asterius?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ah, hahaha, yes!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Such a spectacle is it not?,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
A gracious audience!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"They love us, Asterius!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Nothing like battling before an audience!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Thank you, my fellow shades!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
They know our victory is certain here!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"That cheering's not for you, monster!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
We shall prevail for you in the stands!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
A most enthusiastic audience!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Are you enjoying yourselves in the stands?!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Such fervor coming from this crowd!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"To all who came to see us fight, thank you!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
We owe everything to our audience!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Keep cheering, as we battle to the last!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
The roaring of the crowd fills me with strength!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male

You shall have what you came to see!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"To all our fans, we dedicate this fight to you!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"That was for last time, fiend!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ahh, the sweetness of revenge!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Thus I reassert my status as the Champion!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Your foolish attempts shall get you nowhere!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
I shall send you to hell however many times it takes!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You are forever doomed to fail.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You shall never defeat us.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Asterius and I are undefeatable.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Well done, Asterius!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"We make a formidable duo, don't we, Asterius?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You were a fool to stand against our might.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Back to the hell that spawned you.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
I send you to the depths of hell.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Begone from here and don't return, you fiend.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Return whence you came.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You are unwelcome in Elysium.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You had no chance against the Champion.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"When next we meet, it shall go even worse.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Elysium is for the great, not for the likes of you!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You should have stayed down in the depths of hell.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You failed, as was surely fated.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
That was for Asterius.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Asterius, my friend, you are avenged.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Vengeance is mine, dear Asterius!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You destroy my chariot, I destroy you, end of tale.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Chariots can be repaired, rebuilt! Honor cannot.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"That was for my beautiful chariot, foul daemon.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Your foul deeds shall go unsung, mark you my words.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
There. I shall await when next you clamber to these heights.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Absolutely devastated, aren't we. Hmph!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
If only you could hear the roaring crowd.,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
That'll teach him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That ought to shut him up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who's Champion now?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What a loudmouth.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
They say to never meet your heroes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's one Champion unseated.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Finally.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That'll do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That ought to make Theseus shut it for a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

The fiend has fangs!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
It shall take more than that!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Dah, my chariot!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
This thing is falling apart!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
We can take more than that!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You scratched the detailing!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Try all you like!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Naught but a scratch!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
That was nothing!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Foul daemon!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male

You're next!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Now for the other one.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You and me!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You and me now!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, hahaha, it's finally time, Asterius. He's here! Aren't you, now, you vile, insignificant hellspawn? Prepare now to be overrun!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Oh, this is unfair... that's a bronze-plated Macedonian Tau-Lambda! What's an obnoxious bellyacher like you doing with the most durable chariot created, to date?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Pah! You don't deserve to know. Suffice it that Asterius and I were handsomely rewarded once again. And we shall not hesitate to exploit our hard-fought spoils against you!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"He would pit you against me, Asterius. I can see it in his mis-matched eyes! I cannot shake the terrible vision that, someday or night, it shall be me, standing alone here, whilst you...? Whilst you take sides against me! With that fiend!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Asterius, about that, please consider it a standing offer, if you like. I'd rather have you as a friend than as a foe. Not sure that I can say the same for Theseus, of course.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You poisonous worm! I knew you had a more sinister trick at play, because your fighting style certainly is of no concern just on its own! Are there truly no depths to which you would not stoop?!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"...I'm telling you, you're wrong, Asterius! He is no royalty, most certainly not any I would recognize! He's but a nameless, long-forgotten minor god born of the depths, and bound to stay in them!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I, too, once was berated by such words, king. We've faced this enemy how many times? And in my estimation, he's fought bravely, here.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Bravely?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call bravely, Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"Bravely?! Hiding behind those pillars is what you call bravely, Asterius? We shall have to discuss this strange lapse of judgment after we achieve our victory!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I hope you're perfectly pleased with yourself, hellspawn. Because Asterius has been quite cross with me! Such as he is. He says I have misjudged the likes of you! Outrageousness.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You don't hear me, king. We still have a lot to learn about this foe. Each time, he's differently equipped. Weapons, god-given abilities, and such. Despite our efforts... it's been difficult to read his strategies.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"And now, you're saying I can't fight, Asterius? Even though I had no difficulty besting you within that maze of yours?! Come on, let's do this fight!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"King, I think you are over-reacting, here. Try to be reasonable. And be more considerate about my point of view. Don't think I am asking for too much.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You're asking the impossible of me! But, let us fight. And let us lose, I'm sure, because if we are not a team, what are we, then, Asterius...?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"That's good, because you had me worried for a moment, there. Hey maybe I can knock some sense back into him, what do you think?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm not so sure. I've tried. But I know better than to underestimate you. Fight us, then.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male

"Please fight with me, again, Asterius. I mean, just like before! You must forgive me my indecencies of late. This blasted fiend! His lies and treachery get right under my skin. Or the phantasmagorical equivalent!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Swear something to me, king. That you'll discard your fears about our bond. The short one here is never going to break it. He doesn't even understand it. The only one who can break it is you, yourself.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I... oh, my dear friend, Asterius. I see, of course, you're right, you're right. You're right! And I solemnly do swear to you, indeed, that I shall never again doubt our brotherhood! Nor shall I ever listen to this fiend! Together, now and always!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"Come forth, blackguard, and you shall soon be crushed under the massive wheels of the finest chariot the world has ever known!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You only have that chariot because of me, you know. It's all because of a condition of the Pact of Punishment! Nothing you did or earned. So drop the act!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahahahah, what?! You claim to be my benefactor, when in truth, you are my figuratively mortal enemy?! I'll do the chariot-equivalent of trample you!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Come, blackguard! And be crushed beneath the raging wheelwork of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda, once again!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Theseus, you do know you look even more ridiculous than normal wearing that mask? I get the chariot and the unsporting weaponry, but why wear that thing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bah! This blessed mask was crafted by great Daedalus, himself! A work of art, and my entitled claim as champion! What has he ever done for you?!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Well now, Asterius, he's returned! And this time, we shall have to vanquish him without the aid of our divine armor! A worthy challenge, no?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Be cautious not to underestimate him, king. He has proved troublesome before.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Nonsense, my friend! For how can one underestimate that which deserves no esteem whatsoever?! Together, now, attack!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Well, you senseless monster, I suspect you're not so pleased with yourself, now! Behold!! For my glorious chariot has been restored!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Oh, indeed, nice work! Though must have cost a fortune in gemstones and diamonds, restoring an old Macedonian. I thought it was totaled after last time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The only thing which shall be totaled here, you heartless property-destroying scourge, is you yourself! Asterius!! Together, let us break him!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"My chariot and I stand ready for you, daemon! And I assume Asterius, as well! I feel it in my phantom heart, we shall not fall to you this time!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You know, my opinion of the Macedonian Tau-Lambda has fallen precipitously of late. Though perhaps it's not the chariot but the driver.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Silence!! Show me a finer chariot-driver anywhere within Elysium, why, you cannot! I'll run you down for such an insult to my pride!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ready yourself and your fine armor, friend Asterius! I shall drive circles around him, whilst you dispatch him with your mighty axe!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Your strategy might work a little better if you didn't shout it loud enough for me to hear. Though I have to say I'm impressed you can drive, fight, and shout all at the same time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And I, fiend, am impressed that you yet live and breathe! A temporary state Asterius and I shall soon alleviate! To war!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"He's here, king. Activating armor. It's fortunate repairs on your chariot were completed in time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Nonsense, my friend! We could defeat this vile hellspawn with or without the additional divine protection we've been granted here! Get him!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Avert your eyes, fiend, lest the shining bronzework of the Macedonian should strike you blind! We are prepared to face your devilry!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Prepared for me, really? I've dismantled your ridiculous chariot before. Even Poseidon knows you're just a blowhard with a fancy ride.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How dare you to invoke my Lord Poseidon's name?! And, to besmirch our complicated past! No god shall ever favor you as he has favored both Asterius and me!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Two against one. Seems hardly fair.... Ah, well! <Snort> Let's kill him and be done, king.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Theseus?! The Bull of Minos?! You two are legends! I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, a naked attempt to sway me from my convictions. Defend yourself, you blackguard! And may the gods show you some mercy, for I shall not!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I warned you, short one. Now you face a foe more terrible even than I. The only other foe whom I have ever faced, who bested me.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Hold, fiend! You'll walk not one more step toward the light of day, so long as I am here.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"So! The fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius! Despite having experienced such a thorough thrashing by us last time!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
You know full well that wasn't a fair fight. Face me yourself and we'll see how you fare.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Silence, you monster! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"So! The fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius! Or, rather, to besmirch the honor of this competition!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Besmirch what honor? You're just complaining that you lost. Even though I was outnumbered!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Silence, you monster!! I'll hear no more such wicked lies, half-truths, or quarter-truths! You, however, soon shall hear my blessed spear! Specifically, the sound it makes whilst sliding into your exposed midsection! Defend yourself!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"No. He bears the Twin Fists in the aspect of a king called Gilgamesh. That king, he, too, wrestled a beastlike man, who then became a friend. Maybe that's why I knew this fight would come.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"What are you telling me, Asterius? Now is certainly not a good time for waxing philosophical, I think! And, surely this King Gilgamesh of whom you speak is much more competent a fighter than this filth!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What are those bestial gloves of yours, blackguard? Beginning to show more of your true and savage nature, here perhaps?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

"So, hellspawn! You seek to break through to the surface of the world. But you shall not achieve your goal, whilst I yet live and breathe! Or the equivalent of it, here in the splendors of Elysium!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Then you leave me with little choice but to make you shut up, already. And your bull-headed manservant there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That Minotaur whom you address is my dear friend, you preconceiving stain upon the earth! Asterius and I are brothers here in death as we were enemies in life. Not that you could ever understand fraternal bonds as strong as ours!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ah-hah, the fiend comes crawling back once more, drawn as he is much like the unassuming moth unto the flame of righteousness!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Oh no! Not the flame of righteousness! Are you finished? Let's get this started, I've come a long way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hear that, Asterius? Our fiendish visitor is begging us for mercy. Begging us, no doubt, to drop our guard!! Together now, my friend, let's vanquish him, and may the glory of Olympus guide us!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"And where do you think you're going, fiend?! Thought you might scoot right past Asterius and myself without a fight?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"No, on quite the contrary I've been under no impression that avoiding conflict is an option here. So say your piece, and let's get on with it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You, hellspawn, shall not traverse that gate behind me whilst my compatriot and I equivalently live and breathe! Prepare for death!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ah, hahaha, you are just in time, Fiend from Lowest Depths! Asterius and I have trained extensively since our last skirmish here!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
So all you do here in Elysium is train for martial competition? You're constantly awaiting your next fight to the death?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And who are you to judge, you misbegotten, shameful, unfilial maggot? It is an honor to have the opportunity to spend my afterlife perpetually standing in your ruinous path!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"See here, Asterius! The god-hated fiend is back once more to be destroyed by our joint, righteous fury!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"God-hated? You'll have to be more specific. I have the gods on my side. Though I suppose you do, too. Why can't they make up their minds?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They have made up their minds! They stand united against darkness, as do I! With the exception of Asterius, here, who serves the light! Let's serve it now, my friend! To battle!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Upon my word, the fiend again darkens these halls! Alas, Asterius, it seems I was mistaken and he hasn't learned his lesson after all!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
And what's this lesson that I ought have learned? Is it to always slay you first since you're so damn insufferable all the time?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your lesson, monster, is to never, ever take up arms against those favored by the gods themselves! You shall never see the light of day as I once did! Uh, no offense, Asterius.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Well, hellspawn, you stained my honor last we battled here. But as you plainly see, I have returned! As has Asterius! And we've no shortage of honor left to spare!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Shouldn't I  be the Champion of Elysium, now that I've beaten you? Isn't there someone else around to challenge me, say, Heracles? Someone less chatty?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Ah, hahaha, very clever, fiend. Invoking Heracles' name, in an attempt to drive me to a jealous rage. It shall not work! But you shall dearly pay nevertheless!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"The monster has returned, in a vainglorious attempt to wrest the title Champion from me!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I couldn't care less about your title. Though, shouldn't you share it with the Minotaur? He's more than half the reason you've been any trouble.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You'll not drive a wedge between us, fiend. Asterius and I share a fraternal bond forged from the strongest bronze! Nay, adamant! But you have caused us both offense, so, die!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I have recovered, as you can plainly see, monster! As has Asterius! And this time we are filled with renewed vigor, to destroy you utterly!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"So we're locked in an endless cycle of violence, basically. I guess that's one way for you to pass the time here in this stodgy place.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You take that back about Elysium! Or, better: I shall make you eat those careless, inappropriate remarks! Come, Asterius, to war!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"We're well-equipped to deal with you, short one. Though I know better than to disregard your might.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Speak for yourself, Asterius! I, for one, know only pure contempt for this foul daemon and his underhanded fighting style! A style we shall easily dismantle, now!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, let's go!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What hope have you, monster, versus the blessed bonds of brotherhood?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Best not belittle him, king. He is more powerful than he appears. We must remain alert, this time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Oh, I am perfectly alert right now, Asterius! And were I still alive, I would be positively salivating at the thought of running through this pustule with my spear, or whichever means I had available! Now, let's go!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Theseus, before you flap your ghostly gums at me again, I'd like to hear from good Asterius this time! He almost never gets a word in, thanks to you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The king speaks for the both of us, short one. Though if you wish to hear me say something to you, I will oblige.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"And I, too, shall oblige! That is, oblige my trusty spear, which yearns to penetrate your soft and vulnerable, altogether pallid flesh! Now, die!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Why, look, Asterius, the fiend returns! The rumors that he fled to haunt the surface must have been mere lies!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Well no, in this case, those rumors must have been quite accurate, it's just, I'm back! Realized I didn't want a future for myself that didn't include crushing you repeatedly like this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hoho, such clever excuse-making from one so versed in treachery! Well, if you are indeed contained within this realm, then we shall be delighted to make sure it always stays that way! Now come and fight!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Have you yet heard, monster?! The Queen Persephone is back! To rule the Underworld in all her terrifying grace! Perhaps one of these days or nights she shall be present in the stands, to witness your destruction at our hands!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Yeah, about that? She's my mother. So maybe watch your fool mouth with me, or else I might just put in a bad word!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you disgust me, daemon, that you would even dare to say such things about the Queen! Prepare now to be vanquished in her name!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What's this, Asterius? This blackguard thinks that he can saunter in here whilst bleeding profusely, and confront the two of us?! A hollow fool!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Ran into trouble on the way with your combative friends here in Elysium. One more unfair advantage in your favor.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How would you know of fairness, fiend? You belong in the lowest depths, forgotten in the mists of time! Come, let us send you there!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Look at this contemptible fiend, stumbling half-dead already into our hallowed colosseum! What transpired, monster, did perchance my Exalted brethren trouble your dark path?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Theseus? I would appreciate it if you could be more considerate of the substantial effort necessary just to reach this point where I can make you shut your mouth.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Effort, pah! You shall be imminently slain, and effortlessly, I am quite certain of that! Asterius, to arms!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What hope can you possibly have of vanquishing us, hellspawn, when you are visibly upon the verge of death? You are, more than usual, a miserable sight!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Thanks for your concern, there, Theseus. But I trust I have plenty of life left in me with which to destroy you, if not your companion as well.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah! What would you know of trust! Being a vile, grievously-wounded-already creature such as you are! Asterius, let's end his misery!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What's this? Our enemy has come to mock us, Asterius! He holds the Yarn of Ariadne, and would flaunt it in our faces!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What, this? I just picked it out of a Well. Was supposed to help me get here. No offense intended, more than usual. What's it to you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"As if you wouldn't know! That Yarn is a token of days long gone. When Asterius and I battled in the Labyrinth, to the death! Together, we now face a greater threat. Attack us if you dare!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Again you mock me with the Yarn of Ariadne, blackguard. You ought know that woman's name means absolutely nothing to me, now!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You seem pretty put off by a random bit of twine, there, Former King of Athens. Care to share your innermost thoughts on the subject, or best keep them bottled up?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nothing shall be bottled here, you filth! That she became enamored of me was not my responsibility, besides! She was naive! The same as you.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"That blasted Yarn of Ariadne, once again!! Have you no shred of dignity at all, monster? Or would you stoop to any desperate means to draw me out?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Just happened to have it on me, Theseus. But it seems to keep upsetting you. Maybe you should seek this Ariadne in my father's realm, and make amends?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Maybe you should shut up!! That Ariadne's dead to me. She has been since we were alive! I cherish her memory, yes. But only because, if not for her, I'd not have met Asterius! Now, meet his axe!!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Why, look, Asterius! It seems the fiend has brought some sort of nondescript yarn-ball! Not seen the likes of it. Indeed, it holds no sway on me, at all!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"King. The princess Ariadne was my sister, if you don't recall. Please do not denigrate her memory. <Snort> You're making me upset.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Ah, no, my friend! I meant you no offense! But I'd no love for her, was that my fault?! Pff, forgive me. I... I shall seek her out. Someday or night. But first!! This daemon has to be destroyed. Together, no?!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Why, look, Asterius! It seems the fiend has brought some sort of nondescript yarn-ball! Not seen the likes of it. Indeed, it holds no sway on me, at all!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"King. The princess Ariadne was my sister, if you don't recall. Please do not denigrate her memory. <Snort> You're making me upset.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Ah, no, my friend! I meant you no offense! But I'd no love for her, was that my fault?! Pff, forgive me. I... I shall seek her out. Someday or night. But first!! This daemon has to be destroyed. Together, no?!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Now hold a moment, fiend! Asterius made me aware that you recently asked of him an autograph. A tribute to his fame! As I am Champion, I am prepared to generously offer mine, as well.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Oh! No thanks. Appreciate the offer, though. How about a fight, instead?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, pffsch, you...! 'Twas merely a jest! I'd not have given you the cloth about my loins, much less my name! But a fight you certainly shall have!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ready yourself, Asterius, my friend! For our most hated enemy has come to challenge us again, before this loving crowd!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I don't understand this place at all. How is it you're still champion after all this time? After losing repeatedly and often, I mean.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What would you know of it?! There's more, much more, to being champion than empty victories! It is a way of thought. A bearing! A certain dignity which you shall never have!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"The gods are testing us once more, Asterius! For, how else to explain this fiend approaching us, bearing such blessings as would normally be fit only for heroes such as we?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You do know I'm related to them, right? The god of the dead is my father? I'm sure word's gotten around. Not that I want deferential treatment from the likes of you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Good! For you'll get nothing of the sort. The gods are on my side, not yours, monster! What business would they have, abetting you?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Beware, Asterius! The daemon comes! The daemon, who would sever the fraternal bonds we share, if we so much as drop our guard!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What? You think I'm here to ruin your friendship? Look, to each his own in that regard, though since you bring it up, I really don't see why Asterius puts up with you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You see? Just as I said! Cover your bovine ears, Asterius, for this monstrosity would poison us to get the upper hand!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You know, hellspawn, I have been thinking on this for some time, and I've a declaration I must make: I shall hear no more of your silver-tongued lies. You come here, and we fight, and that is all!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What are you even talking about? I barely get a word in edgewise, much less Asterius over there. You know what? Fine. I've had it with you, anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And I've had it with you! Now, come, Asterius, let's shut this blackguard up! Or shut him down, whichever you prefer.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"There is but one thing I shall give to you, blackguard. Other than the razor-sharp point of my blessed spear! You are resilient. Time after time, you challenge us! Sometimes I fear I shall develop some sort of grudging respect for you!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I've no such fear, myself, Theseus. Though, I appreciate you noticing. You're quite an inspiration, you know? I wouldn't come all this way to destroy just anyone.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"To be destroyed, you mean! I see you plain, monster. You seek the glory of this fight, before this crowd? You yearn for it! Then, you shall have it! Just as often as you please!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I vividly recall our every clash against you, daemon. Each victory! And even the defeats. But you? You've not learned anything, have you?",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"It's all right, Theseus. We have a splendid painting of you back at the House, for those moments when I invariably forget you exist. You were quite dashing with long hair, you know!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So, I am honored even in the lowest pits of hell? And yet, remembered in my carefree youth. Not in the wisdom of my latter days! Well then, remember this!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"What, ho, that is a handsome spear you doubtless claimed deceitfully from some more-worthy bearer than yourself!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Oh, this old thing? How nice of you to notice. It once belonged to the hero, Achilles. A little past your time, but maybe you've heard of him? Seeing as he's much more famous than you ever were.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
How dare you say such things to me! I was the greatest king of Athens in my day! The tales of my exploits with Asterius and many other challenges shall long outlive whatever comes of you!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Tell me something, monster: Whence did you steal that kingly blade you're brandishing about? It seems ill-fitting for one such as you.",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Oh, this? I wouldn't say I stole it, so much as naturally wooed the Fates into bestowing it upon me. You could say I'm kind of testing it out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, well then! I pity whosoever shall lay hands upon that cursed thing, once you are finished with this testing of yours. I think that we can make it rather quick!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"There, king! He has the weapons I told you about... the fists of Gilgamesh. Follow my lead this time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"There, king! He has the weapons I told you about... the fists of Gilgamesh. Follow my lead this time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Prepare to be sent back into the depths whence you came!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Ahh, at last! Come, Asterius, let's vanquish this blackguard!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Come, hellspawn, and get destroyed by the two greatest fighters in Elysium!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Dare you clash against the Champion of Elysium and his most trusted friend?,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"If you seek a swift and righteous death, you fiend, you've come to the right place!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Come forth and die, preferably with some amount of dignity!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"It's time, Asterius! Let us assert our greatness through single-minded combat!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"By the gods of Olympus, you'll go no further on your wicked quest!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
There is no greater pleasure in Elysium than vanquishing the likes of you!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I swear upon my honor, fiend, you shall not pass!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"No matter how you try, you cannot shake the bond we share, monster!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You stop right there, blackguard, and make your plans for death!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"We've nothing left to say to one another, hellspawn! Other than: To battle!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Few others in Elysium are so unwise to take up arms against Asterius and myself!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You challenge us to battle, hellspawn?! Then, Asterius and I accept!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Attack us if you dare, blackguard! Asterius and I stand ready!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I see my brethren failed to thwart your advance. Well, you shall go no further!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Come forth, blackguard, and be vanquished by my righteous spear!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
Asterius and I shall smite you back into the lowest depths of hell!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You are beneath the notice of the gods, monster! Whilst I have earned their favor!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You return at your peril, hellspawn. You'll get no quarter here!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Upon my faith, you'll take not one more step toward the light of day!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Face us, filth! However many times it takes, until you cannot stand it any longer!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Behold, Asterius! Our hated enemy has come to be dispatched before a loving crowd, once more!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Try as you might, monster, you shall not shake either my own resolve, or that of my dear friend!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Our foolhardy challenger approaches once again, I see! Well, then, prepare to be run through!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You face the Champion, and me. Ready yourself.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You face the Champion, and me. Ready yourself.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Let us destroy him quickly, king. Or, perhaps slowly.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Let us destroy him quickly, king. Or, perhaps slowly.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Waste not more words with this one, king. Let's fight.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male

It is as the king said. You will not leave Elysium except through us.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
It is as the king said. You will not leave Elysium except through us.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Look who has managed to come crawling back, Asterius? Let us deliver him again!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"Try as you might, monster, Asterius and I shall stop you!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You must take sick, appalling pleasure in defeat, hellspawn!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
I shall never yield the title Champion of Elysium to the likes of you!,CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"You think that you can get through me again, hellspawn? Come try!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male
"I always shall rise up to thwart your wicked plans, monster!",CHARACTER,Theseus,male

Even with this armor I was unable to best you one-to-one. Perhaps I lack as yet the necessary training to take full advantage of its benefit.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male

You mock me. Yet you know nothing of being trapped; enclosed in something and unable to break free. I need no armor to fight you.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You haven't spoken to your fist-weapons yet, have you, short one? 'I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.' That's what you're supposed to tell them. I'm sure of it.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male

"Agreed on both counts! Just passing through, so if you'll excuse me...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I will not. <Snort> The Champion of Elysium would never back down from such a contest. Neither will I.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Wait, you're not the Champion of Elysium...? You're the Bull of Minos! I can't imagine who's even stronger than you. Is it Heracles? Tell me it's Heracles.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I will not. <Snort> You talk too much, short one. Come get destroyed.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You come from the bowels of hell. This is not your place.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Agreed on both counts! Just passing through, so if you'll excuse me...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I will not. <Snort> The Champion of Elysium would never back down from such a contest. Neither will I.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You have met the Champion, the king. Let us see if you are fit to face him once again.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You mean face both of you, together. Which doesn't seem particularly fair.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Life isn't particularly fair, short one. Nor death. I'd have expected you to know as much. But here, have your fair fight.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Let us clash here again before you face the Champion. We never will allow you through without a fight.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You're nothing like Theseus. Why go along with everything he says and does? You're your own man. And bull.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"King Theseus slew me in life, and saved me in death. I was cast into Erebus. A monster. He found me when he died. And used his influence to bring me here, with him.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"That's nice of him and all, but sounds like you're even to me. Seeing as he killed you in the first place.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No; we're not. And I will fight for him, and alongside him, for eternity. As recompense for helping me to understand exactly who I am.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You bested the Champion, himself. Which means that I have little hope of vanquishing you, here.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"So then, why bother fighting me? You don't have to do this. That Theseus is a highly questionable influence on you!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I see you plain, short one. I, too, was born of darkness. But, I chose the path of light. Even in death, it was not too late. <Snort> Not even for a monster, such as I. I trust your deaths will likewise be enlightening.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
This heat... it reminds me of when I was young. Living in darkness. Learning to fight. To kill.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I suppose you're about to put that learning to practice in another moment here?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I am. The heat fills me with strength. Let's see if it has any effect on you.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Ah. I sense another furious battle here awaits us, short one. Although you're more inquisitive than usual...",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Uhh, oh! It's just, I have an odd request. You see, the god of slumber, Hypnos? Colleague of mine. Huge fan. He's in desperate need of your autograph. Little personalized message? I don't suppose you'd be so kind. It'd mean a lot to him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Autograph. I see. Then, it appears there are such gods as favor me. I will inscribe a bit of parchment for your colleague, then.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"The god-forsaken Minotaur impresses then upon a parchment a brief message to the god of sleep, and gives it to the favor-asking Prince.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Know, short one, that this favor is for you and not for Hypnos. Though he may challenge me himself, at any time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Huh. You mean to fight with me bare-handed this time, short one? I'm not ashamed to say the Champion himself defeated me in such a manner back when we drew breath.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Wouldn't say the Twin Fists of Malphon counts as empty-handed, sir, though it surprises me to hear you could be beaten in such a way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I was hungry and unprepared. Inexperienced. No longer. Come.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You must take pleasure in having to fight against me, short one. I, too, have come to look forward to it. Even if I end up falling to your strength.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Oh, I was going to say, I'd much prefer we settle this more amicably, couldn't we? Perhaps I could interest you in a fine bottle of Nectar? Ambrosia, even?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, thank you. These battles are enough. Besides... you won that Ambrosia from us, fair and square.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Well, you're back, short one. Or Prince. Whatever they call you. I'm not much for formality.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Not much for it either, here, Asterius. Though, speaking of which, how would you prefer to be addressed? The Minotaur, the Bull of Minos? Those aren't offensive to you, are they?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They don't mean anything to me. They mean something to others. I have my name. You know it. Use it if you want. Now, enough.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Say, you're from Crete, originally, aren't you, Asterius? I know this is a stretch, but... I don't suppose you ever heard of a commander by the name of Schelemeus? Captain of the Cretan second fleet, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The king of Crete commanded the greatest navy in the world. Even I knew that, having never seen the light of day, the ships, the sea. Schelemeus, huh...? I might have heard the name. So what?",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"What, Schelemeus was a real person, then? But, Skelly said... ah, you know what, it's nothing, Asterius. Shall we?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yes. Let's.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You've come, short one. I dreamed of this very moment.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Come on, Asterius, we've fought how many times already? What's there to dream about?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No. I dreamed. And in my dream, there was something I had to tell you. Rather... something you have to tell the weapons you wear on your hands. Tell them, 'I see you overcome the wild and make peace with death.'",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Hey, I know what that is, that's a waking-phrase. So I'm to speak it to Malphon. Wait, why are you helping me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know whether I'm helping you or not. But in my dream... an ancient hero fought a beast of a man, barehanded. They became friends, in the end, after a great battle. I long for a fight like that.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I wonder something, short one. You keep coming back. But I don't know why. You're trying to get out of here, aren't you? But something's killing you up there.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You've deduced more or less correctly, Asterius. And yes, let's say there are some challenges remaining once I get out of Elysium. Though I'd best say no more of it than that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That's fine. It's good to know you've fallen just as often as I have. I may not be the one to kill you. But I'll soften you up for whoever does.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You ever make it out of here, short one? I wonder, sometimes, what it must be like... the outside.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You've never been outside? Oh, right... the labyrinth thing. You lived in a horrible maze all your life. I haven't seen much of the surface, but... it's beautiful. Cold. When I'm there, though, I... feel out of place.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Out of place. I understand, I think. I don't see why you'd want to go somewhere like that. It can't live up to the stories. Why ruin it? Speaking of which...",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Everyone's saying that the Queen is back. Do you know what that means, short one?",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Well, for me, at least, it happens to mean quite a bit. I'm her son!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It doesn't mean a thing. We're still here to fight. Though, for what it's worth... my mother also was a queen. May yours treat you better than she treated me. Better than I'm about to treat you, here.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I smell the blood on you, short one. <Snort> You are severely wounded. This will not be a fair fight.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"An unfair fight is not worth having, then, wouldn't you say?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I would not. An unfair fight is better than no fight at all.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You're hardly in a state to fight against me, here. Won't take too long to bring you death.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Great! Thanks for the encouragement, Asterius. Don't let me keep you waiting on that, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If mere words can sap your will for battle, short one, then know this: You never stood a chance.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You look as though you withstood many foes in getting here this time. Barely withstood, that is.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"They took a lot out of me, yes. But you have no idea just how long and arduous a trip it is from Tartarus to here!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What would you know of arduous? Try living in an ever-shifting maze of countless passageways. Now let me finish what your foes began.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"We meet again, short one. For further battle.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Short one?! That's a low blow, sir. I thought you were the big-honorable type.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You mock my sense of honor. <Snort> Common tactic. Now prepare.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You choose to challenge me again. Not many in Elysium so dare. Then, I accept.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Wait, I never challenged you! The entrance to your chamber looks like any other pathway in Elysium. I have no quarrel with you, sir!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
To step into my chamber is to challenge me. <Snort> It is a custom since the time I lived and breathed in darkness. I will send you into such a darkness now.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
My next opponent has arrived in short order.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Short order? That was another jab about my height, wasn't it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I do not jab. <Snort> All of my strength goes into every strike. Observe.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You have returned to my chamber. I trust you are familiar now with what this means.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"It means I've challenged you to a battle of strength and glory, because apparently that's all there is to do for fun around here for those such as yourself?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That... <Snort> Yes. Essentially that is correct. Prepare.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
It would seem <Snort> that the time for additional fun has arrived.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Ah, yes, my favorite pastime: Getting butchered by a giant double-bladed axe. And sometimes trampled.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, good. You have much to enjoy in store.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Well, short one. It seems I must attempt to maim you here, so that the king and I might finally stop you at the gates.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You know, you hurt me with this 'short one' business almost as much as with that axe. Why isn't Theseus 'short one'? We're the same height!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
No. The king is greater. He is the greatest king of Athens! What are you? A willful son of a fickle god. I am beneath your father's notice. And you are beneath the king's. Now fight me.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
It is not often that my challengers return to face another slaughter at my hands.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Yeah, well. You're kind of in my way. What choice do I have?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your choices led you here, and they will lead you to defeat, again.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You are more skilled than I expected, short one. A re-match is most certainly in order.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You're going to force a rematch each time I manage to defeat you, aren't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We and our victories are all impermanent here in Elysium. We live, such as it is, for moments such as these.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Your challenge is hereby accepted, short one.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Another challenger. <Snort> Come get destroyed.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I accept all challengers. No prior notice necessary.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You have returned. <Snort> I'm always ready to oppose you.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You enter my chamber once again, short one. Then, good.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I expected you to reappear. <Snort> Let us fight.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Appears it's time we challenged one another once again. Prepare.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Good. <Snort> It feels as though I haven't crushed the life from anything in ages.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Returned to battle me for glory, short one? <Snort> Excellent.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Come fight me again, short one. We have eternity to grow stronger.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Thank you, short one. <Snort> Few in Elysium dare challenge me repeatedly.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
The short one from the bowels of hell has finally returned.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I heard you had again entered Elysium. <Snort> At last.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Hold nothing back against me, short one. Now, come.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Let us grow stronger in the ways of battle, short one.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I always am prepared to fight whoever dares oppose me.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Let us battle now before you face the Champion, himself.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You seek the Champion. You must confront me, first.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Hrmm. <Snort> It has been long enough since my last fight.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I've been waiting for another round against you. Let's go. Now.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"They said you were headed this way. <Snort> I said I'd stop you. Though, we'll see.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Each time we fight... I think I learn a little more. Let's start.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I had a feeling you would cross my path again. I've been looking forward to this.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I'm going to run you down, or run you through. Your choice, short one.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Told the king I'd try to stop you on the way. He thought I'd have no trouble. <Snort> We'll see.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Come on, short one. I've been waiting too long for this.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You know what it takes to leave this chamber alive, short one. <Snort> Come on and fight.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I have my armor, short one. Let's see what you have.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Let's see if you can cut through my coat this time.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
This armor's heavy. But makes me even faster than before. <Snort> Watch.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You are resilient, short one, I will give you that.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I'm prepared to slaughter you again, short one. Come fight.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Interesting. <Snort> Most never challenge me again once I destroy them.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"What hope have you against the Champion, if you can't get through me?",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You have tenacity, short one. I have to give you that.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You do not take all your defeats to heart, do you? That's good.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You're quick, short one. Let's see if you can get past me again.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Well, short one. I'm curious to see if you can best me once again.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
A worthy challenger returns. Let's see you defeat me again.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Glory and honor to you if you can vanquish me again. Come!,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I welcome the taste of defeat, short one. It is akin to feeling alive.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I'm still learning all your tricks, short one. Come show me more.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Let's see you get through me again, short one.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I'm the one to challenge you this time, short one.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
I have looked forward to repaying you in kind for our last fight.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"You're strong, short one. But I am just as obstinate as you.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"The Champion awaits, short one. If you can get through me again, that is.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Good. Now I can get you back for last time. All I need is one clean hit.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Well fought. Though, your technique pales in comparison to that of the Champion of Elysium. I expect you'll soon see for yourself.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"I respect your strength, short one. The Champion of Elysium awaits. Until such time.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You were a worthy challenger. Most welcome here. Until we meet again.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You have earned your passage. I go now to recover for the next occasion that we meet.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Thank you for sparring with me, short one. I'm glad we've made a habit of it thus.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Urgh... the might of Gilgamesh... I understand it now. But I won't make his friend's mistake. We'll fight again.,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
"Such strength... the strength of Gilgamesh. Thank you for the battle, short one.",CHARACTER,Asterius,male
Peaaaaace!,CHARACTER,Asterius,male
You see?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go home.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go home!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go home, I said!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You brought this on yourself.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Another?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
More?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Well?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Again?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Pathetic.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Wide open.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I thought Achilles taught you to be quick.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Die!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Fall!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fall, blast you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fall, I said!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fall, blast you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Die already!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go back!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're going back!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You cannot cheat death!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There is no escape.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go home, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Kick and scream all you like.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You can't withstand me.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Perish!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Death is inescapable.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Fall!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go home!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You still resist?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're bleeding, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Idiot!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You'll perish yet.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Think you can keep this up?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're merely stalling, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Not yet persuaded to go back I see?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hungry for more, I see?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
My foolish brother cannot help you now.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Blast that wretched Zeus!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Zeus...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Brother? Blast!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Another contribution from my brother Zeus!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Be thankful that my brother favors you!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Poseidon ought not meddle in others' affairs!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I don't appreciate this, Brother Poseidon!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Poseidon...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Damn you, Brother!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Brother Poseidon making time to meddle here?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Poseidon must assert himself at every opportunity!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You'd cower underneath Athena's shield?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Athena cannot save you from me, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll slay you once her shield falls.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Athena would be wiser to stay out of this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How good of wise Athena to join in!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Where would you be without Athena's aid?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Aphrodite has no jurisdiction here!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Pah, that meddlesome goddess of love!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You think of her at such a time as this?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You cannot sway me, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Must Aphrodite get involved in everything?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
To Aphrodite all of this must be some sort of jest!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The hunting-goddess ought choose lesser prey.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Artemis! This hunt is well out of your league!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You are the prey, not me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You'll need more arrows than that!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Boy, you're the one who's being hunted here!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The goddess of the hunt ought know when to retreat.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Predictable the war-god would be here!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'd best stay out of my affairs, Ares!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Turn back this instant, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
This shape-shifting of yours won't last for long.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This must be a delight for your dear cousin Ares, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That Ares can turn any small dispute into a war!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That drunkard's power means nothing to me!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why are you staining my clothes with wine?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You think this cause for celebration, boy?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You cloud your senses with this foolishness!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This is a battle, not a time for revelry!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You would seek aid from drunken Dionysus, then?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Demeter had best stay out of my affairs!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That cold witch worsens the weather still?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The cold is of no consequence to me!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Demeter, you...!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
My foster sister must have better things to do!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That Demeter ought tend some other plot of land!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I'll not indulge such outbursts from you, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'd pit my own kin, against me?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
How vile that you'd drag Olympus into this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Grrr...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You and your relatives!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That blasted...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How dare that...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nrgh, that meddler!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Cry all you like!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Face me yourself!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You leave Olympus out of this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
It seems you need all of the help that you can get!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ah, yes, my dear family being of such help!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
So this is how Olympus is assisting our domain?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How cordial of Olympus to appear!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Megaera, what are you doing here?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why spring to his assistance, Megaera?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're surely needed elsewhere, Megaera!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Don't bother to assist him, Megaera!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're wasting Megaera's valuable time!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Get back to your assignments, Thanatos!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Don't you have mortals to attend to, Thanatos?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No need to listen to him, Thanatos!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Distracting Thanatos from his duties, I see!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You needn't drag poor Thanatos into this mess!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I did not summon you!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Return immediately to your post, you wretch!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You, identify yourself!!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Who is this miscreant?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
What baseborn wretch is this?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That blasted wretch is back?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Begone from here, blast you!!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You shall be very sorry for this, wretch!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Was that a boulder from the blasted sky?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Your handiwork, I take it, Brother Zeus?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Was that your foolish doing, Poseidon?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Another of your blasted boulders, boy?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"A collapse from the Temple, nothing more!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Was that the blasted boulder from before?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You mean to mock me with such tricks?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
A laughable excuse for an assault.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Foul weather is the only kind!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
This isn't what we compensate the gorgon for!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Return immediately to your post, gorgon!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're a custodian, not a combatant, gorgon!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What is the gorgon doing here again?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You summon our custodian for help?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Back to your post, Shade!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I don't appreciate this, Shade!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Begone with you, back to Elysium!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The famous spearwork of the Myrmidons!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You've still some spark, then, Shade?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Face me yourself!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Invite more of your friends, why don't you, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Leave that one out of this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You need assistance even now?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Who else shall you drag into this?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Cerberus!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Cerberus!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Cerberus?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Now, Cerberus!!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What?!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't kill me, boy!!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Have mercy, boy!!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Down, boy!! No treat. No treat!!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Bad boy! Bad!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Bad boy! I mean.. good boy?!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't listen to him, boy!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't have to do this, boy!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got you!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hrnm!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Like that?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hah!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Come on, get up.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Get up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We're not finished.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's finish this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's finish this, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Not finished, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I... can... still... fight!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Then, this is it!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fight me for real, damn you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Enough of this!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You asked for this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Enough!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We're... not... finished!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's see you deal with this!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You... can't... kill... me!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Come on and die!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I shall not fall to you again!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We're not finished!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Blast you!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
That does it!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You truly dare?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Do not hold back!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Hades,droppedMale
No holding back!,CHARACTER,Hades,male

Urgghh!!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Consider that a reimbursement for last time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You are somewhat stronger than expected, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
How arrogant of you to think you are superior to me.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I am still more than capable of besting you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How many times shall you make me do this?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Keep trying vainly as often as you like.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your flailing attempts against me are embarrassing.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

I expected more from you than this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

Where was your savage strength this time?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I expect more consistency from you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You could have done better than that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Beats listening to incessantly complaining shades.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

You did make it this far at least.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

Not even the combined might of Olympus was enough.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Seek better help from all your relatives next time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Would that you applied yourself to something worth the while.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I send you home now with nothing to show for it.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're as disgraceful as our kin upon Olympus.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

"Someday or night you shall look back on this, and thank me, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If this must be the way to teach you discipline, then so be it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You mind your manners once you return to my hall.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How disappointingly predictable an outcome.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You well could have expected this result.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

We have a winner!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You earned it, pal.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You now know that, even if you are able to surpass me, you shall ultimately perish, soon enough. And yet you still persist! Utterly senseless.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I found her, Father. And I'm going to find Mother again. And again, and again, until I have some answers, finally. She'd like some answers, too, beginning with why did you never tell her that I lived? You let her go, and left her to her grief!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Silence, boy! Save all your ignorant and baseless accusations. You seem incapable of heeding my request that you not blather on about a matter you shall never understand. Then, I shall save my breath for this fight!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You were never supposed to live. Took all of Nyx's strength to circumvent what should have been a certainty. Now you cannot stay dead. Such is the wry humor of the Fates.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nyx saved me.... So according to the Fates I was never meant to be born, since neither you nor Mother are of the Underworld, something like that? Or was that just another lie you told, to Mother and whoever else?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bah! You think everything a lie. The realm beneath our feet was appointed to me on certain conditions, not that I had much of a choice. Among them: A one-time surface-dweller such as I would never have an heir.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You really believed that? Then why attempt to have a child, anyway?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You don't know anything! Why anyone would choose to have a child is a mystery to me. The Fates said I would never have an heir. Perhaps this was all they meant.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"To think Olympus has been aiding you. You must be so grateful to them for their aid, without which none of this would have been possible.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Yeah, about that. Father, did... did you let Mother go because you feared Olympus would find out? And... not respond well to the circumstances if they did?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch. Be grateful they have not found out as yet, for all your meddling. You do not know them as well as you think. Ask yourself why she left Olympus, and how. Or better yet, ask her.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, she seems quite lovely, so... knowing you, you probably tricked her into signing a pact to come join you, or something. Since you weren't allowed on Olympus, why not have Olympus come to you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah! Surprisingly not distant from the truth. I took her, boy! I took her down with me. Is that what you wish to hear? Does that anger you? Come, bring forth that anger, then!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So, boy. Did you ask her? About how she came to join me in the Underworld. Did you confirm all your suspicions, then?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You didn't drag her down to hell, yourself, apparently. You're not going to tell me who did, though I can well imagine. Your brothers got to reign forever on Olympus, while you got sent down into the Underworld. So they gave you a consolation prize... didn't they?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You make such accusations, knowing next to nothing. Careless as ever. Poseidon had nothing to do with it! He knows even less than you. If you value her existence or your own, you would be wise to keep it that way. And to turn back!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...She was the Queen. Queen of the Underworld! My Queen. Commanding reverence, and awe, and fear. She was not just... what was the term you used? A consolation prize? You are as disrespectful to her as you are to me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, what would you even know?! You claim so much respect for her, yet you didn't even respect her enough to tell her what happened after she left! But... what am I saying... I know you love her, still, Father. That best explains all the terrible choices you've made.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...All the terrible choices I've made. By the time you have existed for as long as I have, pray you will have made fewer. Although I fear you shall surpass me in at least this one regard.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go. Before I reconsider.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...I have done virtually everything within my power to prevent this. All of it... for nothing. The Fates were not content to saddle me within the earth; they mock me, still.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Maybe they just think you're in the wrong. And that you're an obstinate, overbearing, miserable excuse for a husband and father. Don't you understand I'm trying to fix the problems you caused? Since you're so unwilling to do it yourself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're right. I was unwilling. I made my choices, in all this. I loved her, yes. I loved her terribly. But now... it seems I am merely delaying the inevitable. Go, then. Go to her. But, should harm befall her... I shall bring my worst wrath upon whomever is to blame... including you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What? You're letting me go, just like that? You're just afraid of getting struck down again. You're serious?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
To the death!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Heh. Confronting you like this... it's different now. Still... it is a responsibility, just as before. There is to be no escape from my realm. Ultimately, I must see to that, myself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"That's the spirit, Father! As for me, I find the candor of our interactions here to be rather refreshing, I must say. Especially the interactions between my weapons and your physique. You're tough, but you're an easy target.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And you are scrawny, though slippery, blast you. All that pent-up rage behind your smiling words... come, unleash it once again. I expect you to go all out. To the death!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let's go!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I was reviewing the terms of the Pact of Punishment to which you are bound. Even when my servants resort to extreme measures, they were still unable to surpass you, then. So now, it is my turn.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Caught you unprepared, did I? After Theseus and his Macedonian, I half-expected to see you thundering around on some golden chariot of your own, drawn by sable steeds, that sort of thing. But it's just you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is just me, indeed. However... that should be more than necessary, here. No holding back this time, Zagreus. Are you ready?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What have you done with my ancient weapon, boy? I sense Varatha's form there in your feeble grip, but... there's some garish power you've awakened in it, haven't you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, just took a splash of Titan Blood at the right time was all. There's more to your ancient weapon than you gave it credit for, I guess. Though let's not keep it waiting, no?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, let's not. Gigaros is the mightier weapon, with none of the treacherous past. It needs no fanciful shape-shifting tricks to run you through. Behold!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I never had any respect for Stygius, that blade you bear. Perhaps unfairly, due to Brother Poseidon's sloppy form when once he wielded it. But now it seems quite different in your care.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I think we've grown quite close to one another, yes. Enough to where I've come to know a different side of this fine blade right here. This is the aspect of some Arthur fellow! Maybe the two of you could get acquainted properly?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Arthur! No name either of gods or kings of any realm I know. Then, introduce us, as you say! To this new amateur, to whom your blade rendered its services.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The bow is the weapon of a coward, boy. I said so even to Hera's face. I'm unsurprised that you are drawn to it, and yet... something has changed about it, I can tell.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What, you mean that Coronacht has taken on the aspect of a divine preserver person of some sort, of whom I've seen mere glimpses but seems definitely very capable, and really rather brave?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know not why the old Infernal Arms endear themselves to you. And, I entirely care not in whose weakling aspect you bring them forth, only to fall to me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"There you are, bearing my brother's blasted shield... flaunting it about so recklessly. Though, what have you done to it, now?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Not much, really, besides awakening the aspect of a supposedly unstoppable, dragon-slaying warrior called Beowulf. If it has the power to protect him against a giant lizard, I figure it may help me against you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You presently shall find I'm no mere giant lizard, boy. Though we shall see whether this Beowulf is any help to you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Resorting to mere fisticuffs with me... though, how you got Malphon to look like that, I've no idea. Pray tell, whose monstrous claws are those? A manticore's?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"These claws, I'll have you know, Father, belonged once to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever meet?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hrm. Provided he was flesh and blood at some point, then he resides within my realm. Presumably within Elysium somewhere, sadly bereft of his manticore claws, thanks to you. Come, show me what they can do.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You approach me with that loathsome Rail, boy. Emanating a hellish fury more even than usual, at that. Little surprise you took a shine to it. It was the weapon that I hated most of all.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, someone called Lucifer apparently thought differently, and took a crack at his own father with it, once. This one's for him, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Invoking names you know nothing about. Presuming, all the while, far too much. You take that monstrous artifact for another friend? You would be wiser to be wary of its influence. But, let us fight.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ah, but there you are, boy, finally. Despite my knowing you are always late for everything, here you've outdone yourself by quite some time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh shut up, and get your fork, and burn away that regal cape, and let's get to this, then. I'd no idea you had all these capes to spare! Must have a whole entire storage chamber full of them.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your mockery of me may temporarily embolden you, but achieves nothing useful, in the end.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This cold white substance falling slowly from the heavens. Snow, they call it. Look carefully upon each fleck. Tiny crystals! But structurally weak. They melt! This surface realm... it is held up by mine.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If you're quite finished teaching me about this snow phenomenon, can we get on with brutally trying to kill each other, here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You wish to have your mortal-colored blood spill once again upon this bed of snow, then fine. Let us proceed.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You still have yet to see the sun itself. You know only the light of Ixion, but the sun? It is positively blinding. Hideous.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
It has been snowy nightfall every single time now that you mention it. I didn't know it snowed so much up here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It hasn't always. But, that's of no consequence to us. Especially when there's a raging battle to be fought.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If you are here, then... the Olympians must still be lending you their aid. Just as before! I scarce believe the Queen's preposterous idea worked. That all it took to settle an old score was a blasted family feast.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Come on, Father, even you must have enjoyed that feast to some extent. We ought to do it more often! Good thing you trusted Mother's judgment on that one. So, then, to the death, once more?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Indeed. To the death, as always, boy. Zagreus. Ready yourself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No. You're going home, not me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I never grew accustomed to the air, up here. It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases. I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You know, you're right. The air up here seems pretty good so far. But I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill. I have to say, though, Father: The Helm of Darkness suits you. I'm touched you'd dust it off on my account.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It should not have had to come to this. For all your antics with me and around the House, I always kept my temper, have I not? Unlike you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, let's see. You've berated me repeatedly and often. You've lied to me. Mustered your wretched forces to kill me, over and over. But, sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up. All that's about to change, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We're gods, boy. Killing one another is our lot. Although, I always thought I was above it. I told you that you cannot leave this place. It seems I must enforce my rules myself. I'm sending you home, now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No. You're going home, not me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I never grew accustomed to the air, up here. It gusts senselessly whichever way it pleases. I suppose you must prefer it to the stillness of the air below.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You know, you're right. The air up here seems pretty good so far. But I will reserve judgment till I've had my fill. I have to say, though, Father: The Helm of Darkness suits you. I'm touched you'd dust it off on my account.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It should not have had to come to this. For all your antics with me and around the House, I always kept my temper, have I not? Unlike you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well let's see. You've berated me repeatedly and often. You've lied to me. Mustered a bunch of incompetent wretches to try to kill me. But, sure, I'll grant you that you've always kept most of your anger bottled up. All that's about to change, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We're gods, boy. Killing one another is our lot. Although, I always thought I was above it. I told you that you cannot leave this place. It seems I must enforce my rules myself. I'm sending you home, now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You know now what you're doing here is without any purpose whatsoever. Even if I don't slay you myself, you'll simply perish when you cross that threshold there. And yet you still persist?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I do. Besides, making these treks helps pass the time during the ongoing Underworld renovations. And I'll be in tiptop shape once they're complete!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Would that we had a little more support; the renovations could have been complete by now! As ever, you think only of yourself. But if you must insist like this, then you will find me waiting for you once you get here. Every single time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why? Why do you keep showing up? In spite of knowing that the outcome shall be just the same as how it always was?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Beats having to toil away under your overbearing supervision. And besides, as you may be aware, I've recently made up my mind to leave this place.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Eughh... utterly incorrigible. When next we meet here, then, we'll keep it brief. I have grown weary of our aimless conversations. Now prepare!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You bear the Sigil of the Dead. I wear the Helm of Darkness. Even devoid of artifacts as these, we fight here without witnesses... in shadow.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If only everybody knew you had a mighty son most capable of cutting you down to size, with or without the ability to vanish suddenly.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A very boastful son, who often thinks too much of his ability. Come, then! I'll make you vanish suddenly.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...That pomegranate blossom... I caught its subtle scent as you approached. The Queen has her mother's strength. And much more self control.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What, you're afraid of a little flower, now, Father? One that imbues me with the fiercest might of Olympus, granted, but still! It looks harmless, at least.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I fear your little flower there much more than you. The Queen and her mother... they possess power over life. Thus, power over death.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Extreme measures permitted, even still? You must have forgotten to change the conditions of your Pact of Punishment.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Wasn't an oversight. You're strong, Father. I want to be as strong, and more. Not that I'm taking after you, or anything.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You wish to test yourself against the full extent of my wrath, then very well. You have earned that right. Besides yourself, only the Titans have. Now, then... attack!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
To the death!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You vanquished me... even when I threw everything I had at you, and more. I fought you as I fought the Titans themselves, and still I failed.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, don't take it so hard, Father. There's always next time, right? Meaning, this time. Maybe I won't be so fortunate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Of that, I am most certain. Come, let us see the limits of our abilities, then. I warn you: I shall hold nothing back. To the death!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Nary a whif of Mount Olympus on you, this time. How is it that you clambered all this way, without the generous support of your dear family? Doubtless you merely purged their blessings for some coin.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hey, I resent that, Father! I'm more than capable of getting here all on my own, now, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Such arrogance has led to many a mortal's downfall... and many a god's.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Odd. No stink of Olympus on you, this time. Have you truly come all this way without assistance from your relatives? Or were you overzealous at a Pool of Purging?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Wouldn't you like to know? Not even Nyx believed that I could come this far without aid from the Olympians. Maybe I just have a knack for proving everybody wrong.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You have a knack for being struck down in various, ignoble ways, that much is certain. Come, then! Show me what you, yourself, can do!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Be still. These waters... teeming with Poseidon's river denizens. That one there, before me... it's been taunting me, I think, for quite some time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You offering to take me fishing, Father? Sounds more pleasant than having you slaughter me again, or the other way around.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You mistook my meaning. First, you shall have my spear. Then, that thing shall, if it has not yet come to its senses. Though, if you vanquish me, I'm certain your uncle shall not mind if you extract it, yourself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It is a testament to the awful might of Demeter that, even with the surge of heat created by the Pact of Punishment you toy with recklessly, this place remains a frozen waste.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The Pact did make the road here a little more fraught than usual. But if it couldn't stop me, I can't imagine it could stop Demeter.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Forget her, and the blasted Pact. I'll stop you, myself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Enjoying the delicate warmth of the surface, b Zagreus? Apparently, the generosity of the goddess of seasons knows no bounds.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Does feel a bit different, maybe. Though, Demeter said something about how this spot, in particular, would remain bereft of warmth, as a reminder. Do you think she knows what happened with Mother, really?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Demeter may harbor vengeful feelings and suspicions, but she is no fool. Experience teaches us to know when to quit. Though, evidently, that is a lesson you have yet to learn.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Look at yourself, boy. You barely stand, and yet believe you can surpass me in your current state?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It's not exactly easy getting here, you know. But I'm not going back. Not yet.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perhaps not yet. But very, very soon.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Varatha... I recognize its presence, now. That's not just any three-pronged lance you wield. I could never stand to look at it, once my brothers and my sisters and myself... once our foul work was done.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You mean once you'd chopped up your cruel and overbearing Titan parents, right? Shame you threw it out. It's quite useful.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perhaps the Fates decided that its wielders ought to all eventually wind up on its receiving end. Come, then! Let us see what the great Achilles has taught you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So! You think that you can vanquish me with my fool brother's old, forgotten blade. Poseidon was never any good with Stygius. Grew envious of my spearwork. Now he's famous for that fork of his! Always taking credit where none is due.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Must be hard, knowing that everybody's going to think you learned your spearwork from Poseidon, not the other way around. As for Stygius, I can assure you it's in good hands now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your assurances mean nothing to me, boy. You think yourself quite capable? Then show me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You come here bearing brother Zeus' Aegis. I wonder how much more insulting you could be.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What? I haven't even started to insult you here yet, Father. Flustered by the old Shield of Chaos, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Doubtless Zeus does not even remember wielding it. I never should have relied on him for anything after that! Then, come. Let's see if you're any better with it than your great uncle.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hrm. It grew distinctly colder just as you arrived. So Demeter has been in contact with you, then. That witch. Tell me how much she knows.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What? I don't... wait, this everlasting winter, it's her doing, isn't it? Why? Don't mortals die when it's cold? Sounds like a lot of extra work for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then you are ignorant. Keep it that way, with her. Lest you risk everything, you understand? The consequences would be far worse than a foul stretch of weather. But, enough talk, now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hrm. It grew distinctly colder just as you arrived. So Demeter has been in contact with you, then. That witch. Tell me how much she knows.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"She lost her daughter... who's my mother. But, Demeter still thinks I'm Nyx's son, and... what have you done, Father? This everlasting winter, it's her doing, isn't it? Freezing mortals to death. Why don't you stop this?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The two of you know nothing, then, it seems. Keep it that way, especially with her. Lest you risk everything, you understand? The consequences would be far worse than a foul stretch of weather. But, enough talk, now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Shut up!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...The sea... the heavens, and the earth. All of this belongs to my brothers. We are their kin by birth. But we are foreigners in their country.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
No. No mournful speeches. Now get out of my way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You impertinent brat. Fine. Impulsiveness runs in the family.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There was a time when Cerberus would never have permitted any soul to exit through that gateway there behind you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, that can't possibly be true! What about Orpheus, Theseus, Heracles, Odysseus? Countless tales of brave men delving into the Underworld, then leaving whence they came!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They left on my authority alone. Nor did they take for granted my good graces. You believe you are entitled simply to walk out of here. From your birthright and your responsibilities! But I am here to tell you, no.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"My brothers and my sisters and myself. We, too, wanted to slay our parents. The Titans. Bastards. And worse.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"And you succeeded. Chopped up some of them into many tiny bits, and sprinkled them throughout the pits of Tartarus so that they can't regenerate! Or so I hear. Inspiring, really!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We had no recourse at the time, save to collaborate. Developed a specific plan, and saw it through. And, the Titans...? You think me cruel, yet know nothing of cruelty. But, here, you want something to hate, then have it!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I must admit to something, boy. Achilles taught you reasonably well. I expected that if anyone could train you into martial competence, it would be him.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Though you didn't expect that, one day, I would end up using everything I learned from him against you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I anticipate more than you know. But Achilles merely practiced against mortals. Now, you practice against me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Come all this way again, to fall to me? Would that you paid me such respects back at the House.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What is it going to take for you to understand that your place is in the House?!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I shall give you no quarter, boy. Although I doubt that you expected otherwise.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The sea and air are very still this eve. Though I suppose that is about to change.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Know only that I take no pleasure in what I am now forced to do.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
There you are. Then let us now commence this ugly business yet again.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
The heavens and the seas belong to my brothers; but know that you are still in my domain.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You bypassed Cerberus again, I see. Unfortunately for the both of us.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I had other pressing business to attend to. But I cannot let you leave.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No matter how many times you try, your stubbornness shall get you nowhere with me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're back, with Stygius in hand. Come then, and show me your technique!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The Blade of the Underworld cannot help you here, you realize that, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Your heart-seeking Coronacht may have brought you this far, but shall not help you, here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"That heart-seeking bow you wield... it is nothing but a tool for cowards, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So, Varatha and Gigaros are to clash again upon this empty field. Let us have at it, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I knew someday the Eternal Spear would turn on me. Let's see you wield it, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The Shield of Chaos... what a monstrous thing. How suitable for you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You bear the Aegis so much like your uncle Zeus once did.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You think the Rail of Adamant can vanquish me? We'll momentarily find out.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You would take aim at me with Exagryph? Then, very well.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You would attack me with the savagery of the Twin Fists? Then, come.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Again, you seek to use the power of Malphon against me. Fine.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You are predictable in your arrivals here. Less so during the fight itself.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I was just thinking on when last I vanquished you. Come, refresh my memory.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No matter how often you defeat me, I shall face you here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Remember, I can always get here much, much faster than you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No matter how quickly you're able to get here, I shall be waiting.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Again, you draw me from all my responsibilities back at the House.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I cannot let you go, boy. Some night such as this one, you'll understand.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I shall be interested to see if you can vanquish me again, here, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Come, show me everything you've learned of how to fight.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You've slipped by Cerberus again, I see. Then, draw your weapon, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I see it's time again that we begin our bloody business here.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This blasted place... how can you even stand it on the surface, here?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Who shall be first to return home this time, do you suppose?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It seems it's time again I sent you home, myself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your rampage through my realm ends here and now.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I thought you might arrive right about now. Then, let us have our fight.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'll go not one step farther past this threshold, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The world beyond my realm is not for you. You're going home.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I wonder, boy, who's going to kill whom this time around.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I cannot fathom why you wish to die repeatedly like this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Already here? It seems our Underworld still has many failings I shall have to deal with, after this.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Come show your father what you've learned of late. Do not hold back.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Would that you cleaned your chambers with the same devotion you show getting to these heights.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Untold murderous wretches in my realm, all at my beck and call, yet still you made it here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You have circumvented all of my security measures again. But can you get through me?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I trust you have retained enough of your strength through this ordeal to make this worth our while?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Catch your breath if necessary, and then let us see if you shall earn your bonus for this day.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Bah! Not one of my overseers managed to stop you, again? Must I do everything myself?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I've other work to get to! Arm yourself, and let us end this quickly, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It seems our realm has many weaknesses. I shall deal with them shortly, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let us see if the support you're getting from Olympus amounts to anything of use.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blast, but you're persistent, even now! Though let us see how strong you are, as well.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I should be getting back to my desk. But I suppose the work can wait.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ah, there you are, boy! I was beginning to think I'd need a thicker cloak.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, Zagreus. Even if I vanquish you, arriving here is a sufficient feat.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I must admit, this is a welcome change of pace from all the parchmentwork.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I suppose that you must be eager to repay me for last time, then?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I expect I shall be able to vanquish you again. Though, we shall see.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Perhaps the blasted Fates shall favor me, for once.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Our last exchange left much to be desired, for my part. But this time, we shall see.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Tsch. To have been brought this low... by my own ungrateful child. I would expect such treatment from my brothers, but from you...? Nrrrgghhh....",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Such contempt, for your own father. But we are not finished here, yet.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Your youth provides you with a certain mindless strength. But, such power has its limits.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Now that we had our little warm-up, it is time that we began in earnest.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...You strike at your own father. What choice does that leave me.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Hmph. All right, then, boy. You've stirred my anger suitably, by now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Are you serious?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Urgh... no... I'm... not... finished... with you... yet!!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I... how... you.... Go. Go, then. Go!! Get out of here! Get out!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I told you that I would, Father. And I'm going to. Goodbye.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Wait. Wait, just... if you... if you find her. If you somehow find her? Tell her something for me, tell her... Tell her Cerberus is doing very well.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What? Wait. I don't think I owe you any favors, here. Though, answer me one question, and I'll give it some thought, how's that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I know your question, boy. But, ask it anyway.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Persephone. My mother. Why did she leave?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...I... urgh... blood and darkness...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I... how... you.... Go. Go, then. Go!! Get out of here! Get out!",CHARACTER,Hades,male

Persephone. My mother. Why did she leave?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...I... urgh... blood and darkness...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're not going to cooperate with me on this, are you? Even now, knowing Mother wants to see me again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Urgh! Blast you... you shall ruin everything... with all your damnable questions!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Then, die, already. And get the hell out of my way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"...Blast you, boy... we should have never sprung from Chaos... none of this...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Urgh.... <Gasp> How... I... I went all out! And still...?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blast you, boy. You think you are superior to me? You are a fool.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Urgh...! With your youth comes a certain strength, it seems.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Tsch... I... I shall see you back at home.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How? How is this possible, that this... urgh!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Ungh... The world you seek out there... it's even crueler than the one you know.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Augh! Why... I was much stronger once, than this...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Aah, blast! That you of all my kin would be the one, to do this, to me....",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Mmph... No matter how many times you beat me... we're family. There's no escaping that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Again, you have defeated me, somehow. And yet...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What shall it take... what shall it take for you to...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ungh, you... tell no one at the House. Do you hear me?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Rrngh, you stubborn... you shrug off death as though it means nothing to you...!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...I shall keep coming back... the same as you...!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You... you think that you're the only one... who shall keep fighting?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I must admit... you've learned something. At some point, in all this.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Urgh... were it not for all my wretched kin upon Olympus, you...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Rngh, vanquished again... by my own fool kin....",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Guh! Boy, you speak none of this, to anyone!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Urgh! How did... you accomplish this...?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nrgh! You cannot escape... none of us can.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Augh... then, go, see what awaits you in this realm...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Gah... I, fell to you, again, I... how...?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Gah... you have your mother's perseverance. How is it that you got this strong?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Urngh! It seems... I was no match for you, this time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Augh... I'm not as limber as I used to be, while you...?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nngh... for a student of Achilles... I fear that you surpass even his skill, by now...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Umphh... you broke through every one of my defenses, once again...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Argh... you bested me, I'll grant you, Zagreus...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ungh... Olympus gave you quite the edge against me, then...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Grngh... you owe this victory to all your relatives...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Not this time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You cannot goad me this time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Do not keep her waiting.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

...I can do this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"First, get past the wretched shades of Tartarus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Easier said than done, and doubtless I'll be running into Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The river of flame ought to be just beyond.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Find a way up to Elysium from there, and after that...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...All right, let's give it another shot.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I can escape from the courtyard back there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wasn't this whole expanse once lush and green?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"It's nice and warm out here, I'll give it that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Just a few rides across the Phlegethon, and up we go.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That blasted Hydra must be back by now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This place has definitely seen better days.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This place has definitely seen better days. Or nights?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Lovely place to have to smash my way through.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Lots of Exalted Shades between me and the exit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Asterius and Theseus are probably expecting me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just need to storm my way through that eternal paradise.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know, if I was permanently dead maybe I wouldn't mind all this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"For all his faults, Father did make this place look good.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wow...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Another day in Tartarus. Or night, I have no idea.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Tartarus... I won't be stuck here all my life.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just need to get from here across all that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've gone farther than I can see from here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The chambers of Tartarus have probably all rearranged themselves by now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm going to get through all this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Long way to go. Think I'm ready.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The path toward the surface lies somewhere beyond all that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I can do this. I can do this. I can do this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Through all that... the way to the surface...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Wretches of the damned, beware. I'm coming back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Tartarus... strong enough to seal away the Titans. But not me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Fine day or whenever to get me out of here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I won't back down. Not now or ever.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I know you're out there, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"What do you see, bat friends?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You're free, bats!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You're free, bats! Temporarily.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

How's this place looking?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The House of Hades...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Go, bats, enjoy yourselves!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think it says it's 48 minutes past the seventh hour.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's 7:48 right now I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Looks like it's about 7:50.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's almost 8 o'clock?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's 7:48.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"7:48, that's a coincidence.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Still 7:48.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let me guess... 7:48? It was.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's still exactly 7:48.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's 48 past seven.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Should maybe the good Prince do something else?,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The stone-inspecting Prince gleans nothing more.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male

Father let me hold Gigaros for once.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

That's one prophecy out of the way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I guess this came to pass!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What do you know, this came true.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's see here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh come on.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This one then.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Are you serious?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I need to do what now?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I need to fire up the Pact of Punishment to reveal this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Pact of Punishment is the key to this, huh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's some sort of ridiculous challenge huh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Someone's trying to goad me into using the Pact of Punishment.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I need to use the Pact on my way out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The Pact over there is the key to revealing this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I need to use the Pact back in my Chambers.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
Sounds like the Pact in my Chambers is the only way I'm going to earn this thing.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
I'll have to survive the worst the Underworld has to offer before I can open this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I haven't earned this yet.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've yet to earn the right to look upon whatever this is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll need to survive the horrors of the Underworld first.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I have to earn this I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Pact is fired up, just have to earn this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Earning this is going to be tough.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Beautiful craftwork I must say.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Exquisite use of form.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Breathtaking detail in the rib-cage area.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The subtlety of the expression is a fascinating touch.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There's so much tension in the shape of it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wonderful use of color.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The raw emotion there is rather striking isn't it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I practically can feel the anguish in this piece.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The use of light and shadow is exceptional.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think it represents... the plight of mortal life.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think it signifies the duality in all of us.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I think it speaks to how our pride can be our downfall?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How did they get the fingerbones to look so real.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Truly the work of a great master.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Didn't catch the name of the artist...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Such meticulous craft.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The sense of poise is truly extraordinary.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It looks distinctly different from this angle.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's like a new experience every time I look.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll say!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Isn't it, though?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
And have I mentioned that it cost a lot of coin?,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"It weighs an awful lot, too.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I know what you mean pal.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Definitely yeah.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You said it, boyo.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Isn't she beautiful?,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I was just thinking the same.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You got taste, pal, I will give you that.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
She's definitely pretty good!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Only the best for you, pal.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
That is an excellent interpretation boyo.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I see exactly what you mean.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I knew you would appreciate that aspect.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I know, right?",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"Oh absolutely, yeah.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"You earned it, pal.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
I feel exactly the same way.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Can't get over how tall they are!,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
That is one keen eye.,CHARACTER,Skelly,male
"I can't get over it, myself.",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Made short work that time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Now that was quick.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That was as fast as I've gone.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Done with time to spare.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Quick as a flash that time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hermes would be proud.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In my father's name.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of someone very sore right now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
By my father's name.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I did it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I did it!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
In the name of Hades...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I hear something.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Something's off...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Something's amiss...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanatos.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanatos...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanatos!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
Than!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanatos...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Thanatos...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's him...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Than...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Here he comes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Death approaches?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I know that toll.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Come on in, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, yes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Was just thinking about you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just in time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Guh-dong...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hi there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thus having once more gained the surface of his grim-faced father's realm beneath the earth, resourceful Zagreus makes his way toward the one-time abode of radiant Persephone.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"It is a journey of considerable distances, which he has already completed many times, and which has always ended in the same result. So... imagine he made it there with just time enough to water the crops and tidy up a bit, before...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Once more, tenacious Zagreus achieves his lofty goal, and, just as every time before, except with some sort of new twist of Fate, perhaps, he goes a little distance, then he dies.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Having already seen the splendid cottage of Persephone sufficient times, the stubborn Underworld Prince nevertheless attempts to go there once again. Although, his memory of it shall have to do.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Reflecting on his victory, Prince Zagreus observes how death can take hold in so many different ways, at times quite slowly, and at other times",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The master of this realm, Lord Hades, states that death is inescapable. There is considerable credence to his claim.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Imagine, if you will, the Underworld Prince soon meets one of his typical, ignoble deaths.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The Underworld Prince is getting rather good at this. But let us say he perished anyhow.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"There are a myriad of tales to be told, of both great deeds and of vainglorious defeats, and this has been a tale that falls somewhere in the middle, overall.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Having gained the surface once again, Prince Zagreus breaths deeply of the wildflowers, and the roses, and the like, among which one of them contains an allergen so intolerably potent, that it causes this:",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"As he journeys to his mother's cottage in the cold, loudly-speaking Zagreus calls out to hear the echo of his voice, the blast of sound causing a substantive amount of ice and snow to break off from a nearby mountaintop, and fall, and fall, and...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"So complicated is the path to the well-hidden cottage of Persephone that surface-walking Zagreus on this particular occasion sadly zigs instead of zags, plummeting from off a precipice into most-familiar waters...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Amid the wondrous ever-springing garden of Persephone, Prince Zagreus discovers a greenish plant of some sort, supple-skinned and covered all in spines, a bit too small to see, until it is too late...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The limitless variety of fauna dwelling on the surface brings to Zagreus no shortage of delight.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Though, when he makes an effort to communicate with one, its eyes so full of calm intelligence, he learns that bears are not as gentle as they seem.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Horned creatures are familiar to Zagreus, having fought countless Satyrs and the like; but he discovers, this time, that not even Satyrs possess the sheer, ferocious power of a startled mountain-goat...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Snakes and serpents rank amongst the creatures somewhat known to Zagreus, due to their presence in the Underworld.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"So it is with delight that he approaches one upon the surface, greeting it as a familiar friend. It greets him venomously back, using its fangs.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Alas, the wisely-spoken Zagreus... stumbled upon a pit of deadly spears, perhaps?",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Prince Zagreus proceeded onward toward his certain doom, entirely too graphic to describe.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Beyond this point lies such a horrifying fate that we had better speak no more of it for now.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Just then, erm, how about a very small yet very deadly beetle landed upon Hydra-slaying Zagreus, ending his attempt?",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The never-learning Zagreus then... carelessly fell off a precipice, or something, plunging him into the rapids of the Styx.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Although there are innumerable ways for one to die, our danger-seeking Prince has come to know a sizable variety.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The clever-minded Prince again eluded certain death, up to a certain point, but then, predictably made one of his fatal mistakes, again.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The oft-impatient Zagreus appears to take repeated deaths in stride, and so, here comes another one for him.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Having ventured successfully much farther than before, the surface-seeking Prince encounters setbacks far too hideous to be described.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Just then, the carefree-running Underworld Prince runs headlong into a thick and deadly wall of stone, painted to look like the way out.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Filled with such confidence, the Prince neglected to avoid, erm, stepping on a toxic strain of fungus, so rare you'd not have heard of it.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Having somehow defeated grim Lord Hades in a thrilling fight, Prince Zagreus discovers... it was all a dream! A rather deadly nightmare, actually.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Despite having transcended past the confines of the Underworld yet again, Prince Zagreus proves utterly unable to get past this point.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Imagine that Prince Zagreus experiences some sort of joyous outcome, for a change, in contrast to the arbitrary and unfortunately painful death he shall experience... now.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"After defeating his lord father, yet again, Prince Zagreus begins to shiver, and catch cold. And, as is well known, there sadly is no cure for such a thing.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"As he explores the wonders of the world, Prince Zagreus discovers a quaint farm, in which he carelessly trespasses, stepping on a farming-tool, which swoops up and strikes him in the forehead, fatally.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"One might suppose the Prince's tale most likely ends akin to other tales of the heroes of our time, like so:",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The favor-doing Zagreus then walks into a chamber, black as night, but with a blood-red pool, and from it comes a voice which says: Would you mind diving in these waters, Prince? To which the Prince replies, Oh! Sure.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Mere moments from his final victory, the Prince, in his great haste, ignored surveying each side of a rather busy crossing, where a swiftly-passing chariot collided with him, very forcefully.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The often-dying Prince, having achieved his purpose, then reflects upon his life and deeds, remembering his many past demises with such vivid clarity, that this occurs:",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"In his great hurry to explore the country-side, the hapless-footed Prince steps on the peel of a most-exotic sallow-colored fruit, and tumbles backward with such sudden, violent force that you-know-what occurs.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"He cannot kill me like this every time, believes the Underworld Prince. He shall eventually have no more ideas. But the Prince, as often is the case, is wrong.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Just when his victory was all but certain, a fissure opens underneath the feet of the ill-fated Prince, and from it vents a cloud of superheated water-vapor; steam, as it is known! And probably you know what happens next.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Upon the surface realm, the mortal-loving Prince would doubtless find that death still comes in a variety of different forms. One of the most common, yet perhaps least interesting, involves simply waiting... long... enough... until...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Having achieved his goal, the Underworld Prince discovers that the mortal realm is utterly bereft of the life-threatening excitement to which he has grown accustomed, and the lack of anything of note to do, the sheer mundanity, results in this:",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Then, erm, valiantly striding Zagreus was set upon by seven Bloodless Slam-Dancers, and slain. Or something of the sort.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"So joyfully did Zagreus attempt to gain the surface that, why, he just rose too quickly; and we know how that one goes, from Icarus' tale.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"...I have no new tales left to tell. But do not think that you have won, Prince Zagreus... for any tale worth telling... is a tale worth telling again, and again, and again. Bye-bye!",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The duty-shirking Prince then met another of his fated deaths, in fashion best left to imagination.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"One of these days, or nights, not so very long from now, the Prince may finally traverse beyond this point. And then, what shall become of him and I? Well, hopefully, not this:",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The unrelenting Underworld Prince again vainly attempted to proceed beyond the current limits of this tale.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The hint-ignoring Prince again attempted to transgress, to no avail, into domains not yet prepared for his arrival.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Thus having somehow vanquished his own father, the grim god of the dead, defiant Zagreus is finally set free to seek the hidden place in which his long-lost birthmother resides.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"How shall that all work out for him? Alas, it is as yet too soon to say.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Pretend for now that the Lord Hades absolutely clobbered him.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Beyond this point, our tale of the Underworld's determined Prince cannot further continue at this time. But time does not stand still, and more, much more, shall someday be revealed....",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"For now, there is no more to say or show from here, so let us say instead that Zagreus was cruelly killed, again.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The trials of Prince Zagreus have only just begun...,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Our tale of the Underworld Prince is far from finished. But the rest of it shall have to wait until another time.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The tale of death-defying Zagreus shall continue at a later time.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Thus having stilled the deathless raging of the bone-forged Hydra, willful Zagreus now presses ever forward, upward, toward his goal: the surface, where his long-lost birthmother resides.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The myriad of challenges and dangers that await beyond the flame-hot river shall be revealed and overcome upon a later time.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Let us imagine that the Prince did not go far, before falling once more into his father's house....",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Thus having vanquished the heroic king of Athens, willful Zagreus now presses ever forward, upward, toward his goal: the surface, where his long-lost birthmother resides.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Our tale of the Underworld Prince is far from finished. But the rest of it shall have to wait until another time.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Pretend our deftly-footed Prince did not survive the boastings of the Champion back there.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The burning fields of Asphodel again proved unable to stop the flame-resistant Prince, but then, misfortune struck, just like it always does.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Thus did the fate-confronting Prince traverse Elysium, where he discovers to his great dismay such horrors as can only be detailed at some other, later time.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"As hero-thwarting Zagreus approaches perilously closer to the surface, he... perhaps gets caught within a rockfall of some sort.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"With oft-undocumented dangers of Elysium well behind him, now Prince Zagreus faces an even greater threat... one which I shall get back to you about.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"So stifling is the thick darkness past Elysium, that the ill-fated Prince there bumps his head extremely hard, and dies.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Beyond the splendors of Elysium, the ever-patient Prince shall find his fate, eventually, but not right now, becauseoh no, watch out!",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Whilst well within arm's reach of victory, the bull-defeating Prince succumbs to a large pack of sinisterly harmless-seeming rodents.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Lord Zeus...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Lord Uncle Zeus...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I see your prideful fall down from the heavens to the flames...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Why, look, Zagreus, here comes brave Athena, first to reach you among all my kin, in all her shrewdness. So proactive, you contacted Zagreus prior to even telling me, my dear!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Lord Father, would that I could settle even more such matters quickly and discreetly, so that only the most vital of them rise up to the level of your notice, sir. Though, I'm certain Zagreus and I are very grateful you have intervened.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Nephew! By my divine authority, my oft-misunderstood son, Ares, now shall lend you a small token of his power. I'll make him helpful yet!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"It shall be exactly as you say, Lord Father. Your wishes are identical to mine.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Young man, I know you'd like to get to know the comely Aphrodite face to face, or I don't know, you can decide once you arrive at last! He can decide, isn't that right, my Lady Aphrodite, hm?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Why, I never, Lord Zeus! That sounded rather like a crass remark, from you! How shocking that the golden standard for the rest of us should have such words for me!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Now, Zagreus, once you arrive, we'll have to find for you a suitable mate, won't we? Fine young man such as yourself! Normally, there's much to choose from around here, with some exceptions, of course... such as my cunning daughter, Artemis. Willfully uninclined to take a mate, at all!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Yes, Zagreus, in spite of all these perfect, chiseled prospects everywhere about, yearning to marry or embarrass me, for some reason, I prefer to spend my time mostly alone or with my nymph friends in the woods!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Now, now, young man, whatever you have heard about good Demeter, I'm here to clear the air. She's like a sister to me, yes, but only thus. Although her Titan parents and my own met the same fate.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Why, Foster-Brother Zeus! Such an unlikely bit of candor there, from you! Almost as though you felt compelled to speak the truth only whilst I'm directly within earshot.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Have you encountered Exagryph and said to it the waking-phrase I gave to you, young man? Why, I'd tell Exagryph myself! Remember, it's I see your prideful fall down from the heavens to the flames.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Now that is an entirely unusual design, even for Exagryph! So then the waking-phrase has worked. That aspect's bearer, Lucifer, was it? Struck his own lord father! Tried to, anyway. A not uncommon story it would seem.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I gather Lady Demeter's already got her frigid hold on you, certainly not the warmest member of the clan, now, is she? But do be patient with her, she's been through a lot.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My good sister Demeter already tried to poison you against me, as I understand, young man? Oh, foster-sister she prefers I say, loath as she is to accept her role as part of our great family.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You must forgive the Lady Demeter her scornfulness, Nephew, for she is still recovering after the sudden disappearance of her daughter, though it was quite some time ago the girl, poof! Just vanished. I try to lighten up the mood around it every now and then, but no, a sore spot, still!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Poor Demeter, young man. We still wonder what became of her fair daughter. Ran away with mortals, there, perhaps? Some of the tales, even more preposterous. Don't go believing everything you hear, and do be sensitive about the subject, hm? Demeter, she's been through quite enough.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"The Lady Demeter still prattles on about her missing girl, Zagreus. But I want you to understand something, all right? She's gone. We all have grieved. Perhaps Demeter shall finally accept what has occurred, and we can move forward, having grown stronger as a family.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Sure hope this works.... In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! For you, in all your splendor, Lord Uncle Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"My, what is this you have for me, young man? Appears to be a message of some sort, bearing my thunder sigil! Though, there's one for everybody on Olympus? Have they as yet received their own? I must know what it says... it's from your father, who else could it be? I'd better check on this!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I eagerly await learning some more about the contents of that fascinating message you had sent up here, Nephew! How mysterious, indeed. I'll be keeping an eye on all the others that come in!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I have to tell you, Zagreus, that it was wonderful to meet with you, at last! We were so pleased to learn Persephone was safe! And Nyx, why, she's as stunning as they say. Shouldn't have lied to us about your parentage, but, I know things get complicated, here, and that what's done is done!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Poseidon sought you out already, hm? My boastful brother gets on with Lord Hades even worse than I, so let me put a little spark into his storms for you!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My brave daughter Athena beat me to you this time, has she? No matter, with her blessing and my own, you shall be nigh unstoppable!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Has lovely Aphrodite put you in a trance already, Zagreus? Or might I offer you the blessing of Olympus to intensify her catastrophic power with my own?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"So my elusive Artemis has shown you favor, has she? The little scamp, she seldom shows respect to anyone, not even me! But I'll enhance her blessing nonetheless.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Getting along with Ares, are you, Nephew? Heh. Would that you were my son instead of he, but no, I jest, I jest! Here, take my blessing, please!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"It pleases me to know, young man, that you and Dionysus have been getting on so well. He could use a level-headed friend, and you could use my blessing!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Hmm! You've traveled rather quickly to this point... which reminds me, I've not seen swift Hermes anywhere of late! The rascal's likely dallying about!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Nephew, I have somewhat of a favor I must ask. You tell your father, if you so happen to run into him again, that his brother Zeus forgives him, and would like to reconnect, and welcome him into the family again. You tell him for me, hm?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"So you are son to Hades by that Nyx, the night-goddess, is that correct, Nephew...? Well I suppose she's closest to a queen as your lord father's like to find down there. I tried to match him up with some more wholesome types, but no, and here we are.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"After we learned about your plight and your existence from the goddess Nyx, all of us on Olympus rallied to assist you just as best we could. A family such as mine protects its own!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My brothers Hades and Poseidon once fought bravely by my side, you know that, don't you, Nephew? We prevailed against the Titans and established law upon the earth. Your father then descended to the land of death, and we've not seen much of each other since.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Your father must have told you that his governance over the Underworld is due more to the weaving of the Fates than by his choice. Admittedly, he got the short end of the stick. Whereas Poseidon and myself, why, we've been doing rather well indeed.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My brother Hades always was a lonesome man, you know. I pitied him! But I could never quite extract him from his thorny shell. Now he stews resentfully down there. You needn't bear the brunt of his frustrations.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Old Hades has continued to ignore my every effort to reach out to him, young man. Ah well, but he is obstinate, indeed. You are wise to seek your family's better half.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"By the way, Nephew, I hear-tell your mother Nyx is quite the catch! If you'll forgive my saying so, of course. Your father's never had much of a sensibility around companionship, though perhaps this concubine of his brought something out in him, at last!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"If and when you reach the surface, Zagreus, you call upon me then and there, all right? I'll personally see to it that you'll be escorted up to Olympus, and your quest shall be complete!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I know just how much you must want out of there, young man. And I want that as well! Heh. Good thing for you, as I get what I want around here. Ask anybody!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You fight your father's legions with Varatha, the Eternal Spear? The irony must not escape him, for he long ago stood by my side against the Titans, with that thing in hand!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"It seems the bow called Coronacht is safe and sound there in your hands, young man. I've not seen that old thing in quite some time!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"That shield of yours, called Aegis, why, in fact, it's mine from long ago, young man! I've no more need of it, of course, though how you found it, you shall have to tell me once you're here!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Well, if it isn't the one and only Rail of Adamant in your possession, there! To strike one's enemies from afar is really the only way, I think, and it's about as good a substitute for lightning bolts as you're likely to find!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Now, isn't that Malphon the Twin Fists there in your possession, Zagreus? Last god I saw bedecked in those old gloves was Demeter herself, oh, way back when! She was a real fighter at the time, not just a naysayer!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Ah, now that's the Aegis that I know and love! Or used to love, at least, the dear old thing! Now I quite love these shocking bolts of mine. Though I am proud you've given Aegis a good home, and bear it in my name!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Hark, young man, for I've a vision I must share with you! A waking-phrase for Exagryph, to be precise. Please beseech the weapon thus: I see your prideful fall down from the heavens to the flames. An odd connection to a past or future bearer, apparently one who defied a god!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Nephew, I wanted to mention, it was odd how by every account you'd come quite close to breaking free from there at last, of late... only to be abruptly cut off from our contact! I suppose having suffered some ill fate? Perhaps your realm's guardian, Cerberus, is even deadlier than reputed!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Your dear mother Persephone is a shrewd woman, Zagreus. More than an equal to your mighty father! I'm pleased to know you've made amends with her, and taken new responsibilities within your House! Naturally, I'll continue to pitch in. And, I hope that we'll meet again, someday!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I must say, Nephew! Although it pleases me that we, here, reconnected with your father's realm... just between us, it pleases me even more that you are able to keep sticking it to him! You keep that up, all right?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Zagreus, you have a clever mother in Persephone! A very clever mother. And a lordly father! They make quite the team, that's evident! True rivals for Hera and me!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"The lord and ruler of Olympus and the world, why, he needs a healthy sense of humor, no, young man? Now there's an awful lot of spoil-sports out here, can't take even a little joke, well, I know all their mothers, fie on all of them, I say! Let's joke away!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I suppose even down in the Underworld, you would have heard such tales of me, young man. They're all untrue, hahaha! Except the tales of my bravery. Those are completely accurate, though all too modest, in most cases, I must say.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Ah, must be my gleaming Thunder Signet that I transferred to you! Why, I could feel its call from all the way up here!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Why you look positively dreadful, Zagreus. That place is doing you no favors, I can tell! Luckily, I'll do you favors aplenty!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You seem in dire need of some assistance, Nephew. So, of course, I dropped what I was doing and then sought you out as quickly as I could!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Zagreus, you must have left most of your lifeblood back the other way, hahahaha! Oh, I jest, I jest! But you look terrible.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"No, no one likes to die, young man! But since you seem about to any moment now, you keep your head held high, do you hear me?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Well, let's face it, Zagreus, you are as good as dead right now. But you'll just slosh right back out of the River Styx, and give it a good try again, won't you?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Remember, young man, dying is for mortals. So don't go making a habit of it, there! But if you have to do it, do it fighting, like a hero would!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I wonder, Nephew, whether you're prepared as yet to harness the surpassing power I shall grant you now? Don't take this blessing lightly, and may you use it well.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"How about, young man, we cease with all the trifling down there and cause a real storm for once? Take now the fiercest of my powers, and you show your no-good father what you're made of!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
Is this really him? OK. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Greetings there, young man! Look, your father's always been rather difficult, and he's not so much as called in quite some time. You'll have a better home where you belong, here on Olympus! And to help you on your journey, have my blessing.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"We meet again, young man! Yours isn't my affair, I know, and yet I cannot help but take an interest in your plight. Your father cast his lot; he need not take his anger out on you.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Hello, young man, and might I offer you a little taste of the heavens themselves? Though, don't go telling your old sulky father I've been spoiling you rotten!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I and all of us upon Olympus are anticipating your success, dear Nephew! Now let me see if I can't help spur you along.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Well, my nephew, you're admittedly in quite a bind down there, but what is life without its struggles, hm? You'll make it here, eventually, I'm certain.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I like the fire in you, Zagreus, and I have every confidence you'll someday clamber from the shadows there into the light!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Here on Olympus, Nephew, we take care of one another and support each other, quite unlike how it must be there in your father's grim domain. No wonder you intend to leave!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I'd ask you offer my respects to your lord father, Zagreus, but I suspect you won't have such a chance anytime soon, considering how far you'll come with my support!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Remember you've as many chances as it takes, young man, to fight your way out of the dark and join us in the splendor of Olympus!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Your grim-faced father's such a spoilsport, Nephew, the way he keeps impeding your escape. Ah, well, just keep at it, hm?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My greetings, young Nephew, and more importantly, my blessing and my strength be with you as you journey towards your rightful home.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Faith and courage, Zagreus, for each and every one of us upon Olympus is behind you all the way throughout this whole affair.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"What can I say, young man? You may not make your father very proud, but it is just the opposite with me! Now go, get out of there!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Now, Nephew, how about we put both of our backs into this one, and see to it that you go farther through those depths than you have ever managed yet!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Know that many mortals ask me for my blessings constantly, and I mean all the time, young Nephew, but for you! You needn't ask at all!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Far be it from me to raise my hand against your father, dear Nephew! Although I do suppose old Hades has it coming, doesn't he.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I've every confidence in you, young man! Now you remember that, and take my blessing here, and fight your way on out of there for me!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Nephew, I want you to go and show that surly Hades everything you're made of! And, I've arranged for you a little bit of help along the way!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"How is old Hades doing, anyway, Nephew? I suspect he's every bit as prickly as ever, whereas you are nothing of the sort!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I eagerly anticipate getting to meet you face-to-face someday, dear Nephew, just as soon as you can up and out of there!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Good Nephew, I return once more to lend to you my power! I'd like to see your discontented father try and stop you now!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"It is my solemn wish, dear Zagreus, that eventually we settle up our differences with your lord father. But for now, we fight!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Hail, my most honorable, beloved nephew, and I bring to you the blessing of Olympus, so that you might finally get out of there, already!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I just know you'll reach the surface here eventually, Zagreus! And I look forward to our meeting when you do!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"We'll keep you safe here from your father, Zagreus! But while you're still inside that Underworld, there's only so much we can do.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You've a good head on your shoulders, Zagreus, so stay positive, stay healthy, and let nothing stand between you and your goal!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I wish you well in your continued quest, and offer my sincerest blessings, and of course my power, there, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
You've seen the sheer destructive power of the heavens! Just imagine what it's like above the surface of the earth!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Someday when we'll be resting easy on these heights, why, we'll look back at this and laugh, I'm sure of it!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Ahh, but if it isn't my most favored nephew! Striving always toward the surface of my world. Your father cannot possibly believe he can contain you, can he?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You have my blessing now as ever there, young man.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I trust you shall be getting out of there in due course, Nephew.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I shall be watching over you, young man, though it is dark down there!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"May the might of Olympus guide you through the shadows, Nephew.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Don't let your father get to you, young man, and climb on out from there.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Zagreus, we won't be giving up on you, so you keep at it, hm?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I shall make the heavens themselves now aid your ascent, Nephew.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You'll watch yourself down there, won't you, young man?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"All of us, we're here for you, young man!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Please do be careful not to make your situation any worse, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I'm here for you, young man, so you take heart, and more than that, take this!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"All of us believe in you, though certainly no one so much as I!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Here's something I can do to help, young man!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You just take all the time you need in terms of fighting your way out of there, young man!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Now, don't lose heart, young man, and we'll keep at it with you here, as well!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"As my kin, you are a born fighter, Zagreus! So put your back into it, and you climb right up!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"It shall be glorious, indeed, the day you finally burst from that oppressive den into the light!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I know you have it in you to surpass your father, Zagreus. Assuming you are anything like me!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"How fares your lovely mother? Things still good with her and Hades, hm?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
You tell your good lord father that his brother Zeus shall be always watching over you!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
I trust your good lord father's treating you all right?,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I know you're busy, Zagreus, though someday you shall have to visit us!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I'm never quite so busy that I can't make time for family, young man!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"We're all in this together, aren't we, Nephew?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I see the boatman of the Underworld has found the means to reach you with my blessing, Nephew. Such strange alliances we forge these days!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Why here I am, young man, in such strange circumstances I might add! Luckily the boatman Charon is much easier to get ahold of than your father!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Ah, so then the boatman Charon came through for us after all, did he? Whatever means we have to reach you, we'll employ!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Your Charon there must drive quite a hard bargain, Zagreus, if he would keep you from your victory just for a bit of coin!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I thought that ferryman would be content to transfer souls across the River Styx, not rob you on your journey to the surface, there, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My blessing isn't good enough for you, is that the way of it, young man? How impetuous of you. Oh, I never!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"It isn't wise to go against me, Nephew, both in matters large and small. I am not known for being charitable to the insolent.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Perhaps you have defied me here in jest, young man. Though in such cases pertinent to my authority, you'll find I lack a sense of humor.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Audacity runs in our family, Zagreus, but my advice to you is that you keep it carefully suppressed in your relationship with me.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"What have I done, good Nephew, to deserve such scorn? Your lapse in judgment here is not so easy to forgive, yet easily punished.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Your father likewise turned his back on me before, Nephew, and we both know what has become of him. I'd caution you against this.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Apparently, the consequences of displeasing me have slipped your mind, young man. A harsh reminder is in order, then.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I did not restore order to this world, and claim the heavens for myself, only to be insulted by my own nephew!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Why, Nephew, is this all some sort of jest to you? It isn't one that I appreciate!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Nephew, when presented with a choice to side against me or not to be such a fool, do be sure to choose the latter next time, hm?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Don't say I didn't warn you, young man! I only wish that I could say you didn't insult me!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"This is outrageous, Zagreus! Even your father would agree that actions such as that can't go unpunished.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Young man, I don't know why you would do this to me, though I trust you're going to think twice, next time!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You overstep your bounds with me, Nephew! But I shall make you fall right back in line.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Sorry, Lord Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Apologies, Lord Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Forgive me, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hate to do this, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, very well, good show, young man! And I think I shall let you off the hook, and take you back under my wing, for now.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Commendable of you to live through that, and I suspect you shall think twice next time before so brazenly defying me, won't you?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Now, now, no need to hold such grudges any longer I suppose, but you just mind yourself around your Uncle Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Do not spurn me again like that, do you hear me, young man? I think you do, so let's put this to bed and move along.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Oh Nephew, but I simply can't stay wrathful toward you, much as I might try! Though, better not to tempt me, just in case.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"All right, all right, let's call the score between us settled up for now. Just don't go spurning me again, you understand?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"All right, this is becoming unproductive, Zagreus. As you were!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Oh, I don't have the heart to keep exacting vengeance on you, Nephew.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I say, such petty squabbles. Aren't we better than this, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Well, young man, I'd say it's best we put this little slight behind us, wouldn't you?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Pah! All is forgiven and forgotten, Zagreus. What were we even going on about back there?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Hahaha, that is quite enough, that's quite enough, I say! You're still alive, aren't you?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Lord Zeus, erm, Uncle? Please accept this offering, and all my gratitude.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Goodness, Nephew, that's an offering, indeed! I'm thankful for your piety to me, and as a show of generosity to you, in turn, I present this!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I thank you, my Lord Uncle Zeus, for your benevolence and your thunderous might.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You honor me, young man, as well you should, for I am ruler of Olympus, am I not? Such courtesies are shown me constantly, yet I appreciate them all.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Lord Zeus, I bid you please accept my humble offering, for all you've done for me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, that is rather generous of you, and I'm grateful for it, Nephew! How good of you to make attempts at reciprocity!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"This offering is but a trifle, Uncle Zeus, for all your magnanimity.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So fine a gift again, my dear Nephew? Would that my sons and daughters on Olympus here would show me such respect from time to time!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Please, Lord Uncle Zeus, accept this gift of Nectar in your honor, though it is such a pittance in comparison to all the generosity you've shown.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm very pleased to see a show of such respect and admiration for your uncle, Zagreus. You'll go quite far here on Olympus with an attitude like that! Not everyone's as mannered, nor as wise.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"If you can hear me, mighty Uncle Zeus, I wish to make to you this simple gift, and with it send my humble wish that someday you and Father settle all your differences, and be at peace.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, most splendid of an offering, young man. And while we've yet to even meet in person, I already feel as though the two of us are close, why, closer than you must be even with your father! Oh, hahaha! Perhaps we ought go telling everybody I'm your real father, am I right?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"If you can hear me, mighty Uncle Zeus, I wish to make to you this simple gift, and with it send my humble wish that someday you and Father settle all your differences, and be at peace.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, most splendid of an offering, young man. I already feel as though the two of us are close, why, closer than you must be even with your father! Oh, hahaha! Perhaps we ought go telling everybody I'm your real father, am I right?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"King of the Olympians, Lord Zeus! Forgive this offer of Ambrosia, for I know you have no limit of it there. But here, it is the finest gift that can be given, and even still it isn't anything compared to all you've done for me. Thank you, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now, now, Nephew, you are most generous, indeed, in showing all this deference to me. But we must keep some distance, shouldn't we? Lest all the others here, why, they would be most jealous if they caught me playing favorites! Even though you are my favorite! Presently, at least.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My thanks, Lord Uncle Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Olympus smite you!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
It shall be so.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
That can be arranged!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
Easily achieved.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
Now is the time to strike!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Hoh, you watch this, young man!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
I'll strike them down right now!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
I can take care of that!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
How dare you anger me!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zeus,droppedMale
I'll teach you some respect!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zeus,droppedMale
"Don't be a fool, young man.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You ought know better, Nephew.",CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zeus,droppedMale
You truly are my brother's son.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zeus,droppedMale
"How dare you, young man.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Best not to make me angry, my nephew.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
The sheer audacity!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
I ought to strike you down!,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Have you gone daft, Nephew?!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Now you ask my favor, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"A generous offer, Lord Uncle Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I can't say no, Lord Zeus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Lord Uncle Zeus, I accept.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A swift death is a mercy of a retribution.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"I did not become ruler of Olympus by forgiving trespasses, young man.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
You can't run from heaven.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
Struck down.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"How do you do, young man.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"My blessings, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
How fares my brother's son of late?,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
Well I don't see why not.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
I've something for you here.,CHARACTER,Zeus,male
Lord Ares...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hello, Lord Ares...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, my hellborn kin, I have to say that there are times I wish I could have been acquainted with your father somewhat more, if you'll forgive my saying so. My father and my uncle, here... they're predisposed quite differently than I.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Perhaps if you were not so odd, and made more effort to be somewhat more approachable, Ares, then we'd have more in common, you and I! Should you need any tips on that, why, you just let me know!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I wished only to speak to you in private once again, my kin, except, you see...",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"...Except you see, dear Cousin, that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable. I caution you around my half-brother, is all. Now carry on.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You interrupt me once again, dear sister. You know I do not care for that. I warn you to stay out of my affairs. I shall aid my kin as I see fit.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares. Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
I so anticipate the day you finally arrive upon Olympus. There are few amongst us here with interests such as those I think we share.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"There are at least a few of us who share such interests here, isn't that so, Lord Ares? As for you, dearest, you take all the time you need!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Wars waged over love, my kin... can you imagine that? The lady Aphrodite and I can endlessly discuss such circumstances. I trust, from time to time, you stop to ask yourself how come you choose to fight. Not that you need a reason, of course.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Oh, Lord Ares, truly there isn't the need to cloud our little godling's thoughts and judgment with such comments, is there, hm? Let's give him what he wants, and we can carry on in private, about that.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Ah, my kin! I was just inquiring with Lord Dionysus here, under which circumstances are the greatest mortal feasts of all prepared? Because I have a certain hunch, regarding that...",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Yeah, yeah, Ares, I will hand it to you, man. There's nothing like a feast after a war, all right! Provided you're on the surviving side, that is! Otherwise I guess they'll be feasting with you down there, Zag!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"The cold of death is quite becoming of the Goddess Demeter, do you not think so, my death-dealing kin? She is becoming well accustomed to it, too.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I think that you forget yourself, Lord Ares, sir. For I am much your elder; my famines had already slain the mortals by the tens of thousands by the time such thoughts of doing so first crossed your mind.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Ten thousand souls have fallen to you, now, my hellborn kin. I am rather beside myself, I must admit. Fine work.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Here goes, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lord Ares, please consider our proposal... once you're able to decipher it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"My, what is this, my kin? Some sort of invitation for me, I presume. Not just for me... this symbolizes all the others, here? Most intriguing. I shall investigate the meaning of this as quickly as I'm able, then. But first!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I wish to tell you once again I had a splendid time during our recent shared festivities, my kin. At last, I've finally seen your death-filled realm firsthand! I learned a great deal. And I look forward to learning more from our successful collaboration, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Lord Zeus has gotten to you first, I see? My father's gifts are generous, indeed, though... I think I can help in my own way.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The blessing of your uncle Lord Poseidon might have helped you to this point, but here: My gift shall see you further still.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You bear the blessing of Athena, yes? She would protect you from your enemies, whilst I would rather that you slay them, and be done.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Mm, I see you have the Lady Aphrodite's blessing there already. Love and death, together, hand in hand? Sounds most agreeable to me.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"So Artemis, my lonely half-sister, got to you first? She merely helps you hunt, whilst I shall help you kill. Observe.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"That drunkard Dionysus cannot help you near as much as I, my hell-born kin. Compare the gift he gave to what I offer you.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Our messenger Hermes has been in contact with you by now, yes? Perhaps you shall not see him very often, for my work keeps him rather preoccupied, shepherding souls and such.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I faintly sense the mark of Goddess Demeter upon you, hm? Her power over plentitude is opposite to mine in some respects. But, lately, she has channeled it in manners more agreeable to me.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, you bear your own father's blessing, my kin? Such a surprise... I know the two of you are now in league, and yet... I am still quite accustomed to the thought that you harbor war-like hatred for one another. Perhaps there's still a trace of that, though, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Did you happen to know, my kin, that you have slain more than a hundred foes since you began your quest? You have! For I am keeping count. And I am most impressed.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You are a most impressive death-dealer, my kin. For by my estimation, you have slain at least a thousand souls down there! Souls mostly having died before, but still.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I know that you have many aspirations, my good kin. To be plain with you about my own motive for a moment: As long as you continue bringing swift and steady death, you shall have my unyielding support.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The more you slay your enemies, my kin, the stronger the bond between us, I think. Can you not feel it, too? Though, perhaps your lust for blood overpowers your other senses, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Perhaps you know a god called Thanatos? The two of us are very close associates, you know. Do give him my best wishes, should you see him soon.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I trust that Thanatos is doing well? Although he brings to mortals merciful release, whilst I most certainly do no such thing, I do appreciate his take on it.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"It is my understanding that you have grown rather close with Thanatos, my kin? A perfect choice of mate; though I confess I'd not expected Death to have affection for another save himself.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You traveled rather far down there since last we met, my kin. And that means you have dealt incalculable death. I must commend you thus.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ahh, my kin! I sensed fresh bloodshed from you recently, the real kind! For you have slain the living near the surface, have you not? Mere vermin, yes, but good enough for me.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Recently, there was a burst of violence on the surface, near to where you are, but higher up. 'Twas altogether odd, but must have forced you to return once more. No matter; time is on our side.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I sense so much death at the gates of your father's realm, of late, my kin. Now, I know that seems perfectly ordinary on the face of it, except... there's something more. I wonder if you know the reason why...",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I know your efforts to come here have repeatedly been thwarted, my good kin. However, we have caused such violence in the intervening time, that we must take this as a real victory. Let us continue for however long it takes.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Surely you've heard rumblings about a war which has erupted on the surface, here? Doubtless you've seen an influx of fallen mortals. It's quite a decent one, I have to say! Though, unlikely to rise to the ranks of the greats. Too few armies involved in it, I fear.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"War's such a wondrous thing, my kin. It solves so many different problems, whilst perpetuating its own inevitability. Let's keep it up, then, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Do you ever think to yourself that you were born a bit too late, my kin? For my part, I wish that I could have been there myself when my father and the others waged ferocious war against the Titans. Ah, it must have been a sight!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I sense that you have forged a greater bond with your instruments of destruction there, my kin. Then that is very good. And may their altered forms serve you quite well.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Why, I believe that is the Frost Fair Blade you bear! I understand it shall become the instrument of choice of yet another god of war, someday. I long to meet him, this fellow student of death.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, that blade of yours... it looks as though it could relieve a mortal of his head with ease. Excalibur, is it? I've studied all the Fates' designs, and this one is among my favorites.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The fated bow Sharanga, in your grasp! That is not a form I'd expected you to wield. You have exquisite taste in weaponry, my kin!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Is that the fire-eating shield of the great warrior Beowulf, which you have there? I knew the Fates had plans for it, but I did not expect for you to be a part!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Those are the gauntlets of the fated king Gilgamesh, are they not? A bringer of destruction, and an agent of the Fates. You are full of surprises, my kin!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You bear the warring instrument of one called Lucifer, I see. I've little to go on about him, but it is clear he knows a thing or two about destruction, is it not?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, you bear the Blood-filled Vial which I granted you! The mortal's blood contained therein... I drew it myself! Too seldom am I able to become directly involved in such matters.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Know that I admire your Lord Father very much. For his grim work lets me continue mine. I trust that one day you shall settle your dispute.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You are the son of Night herself, they say? A fascinating character, ill-liked upon Olympus, although I myself have always longed to meet her.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, my favorite Underworld death-dealer. I so look forward to the pain you shall inflict this time around.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Would that a sudden scourge of war would help you out of your predicament. Why, I would stir one up for you without a second thought.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, my closest kin in all the Underworld, I see you there, I think! What sort of violence shall we sow together this time, you and I?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"There's so much insufferable talk of peace up here, my kin. It is quite the relief to focus on much more important things, with you.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You must know I often hunger for destruction, almost uncontrollably at that. Though I am finding you are able to sate that appetite of mine.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"May all the death you bring become the stuff of legends told in fearful mortal whisperings around the world, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Would that I knew the goddess Nyx, myself, my kin! So many of my wars are waged by night. I am most grateful, and I wish her well.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"How is your mother Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"How is Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Do tell your mother Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here, although we haven't met. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Do tell Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and your dark mother, Nyx, some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and the goddess Nyx some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Your mother Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The goddess Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You shall be pleased to hear that your own mother Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You shall be pleased to hear that Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Please send your mother Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Please send the goddess Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You know, my kin, I had misunderstood that Nyx was your mother. But, Persephone? I never took her for the sort to have an interest in your realm. Alas that we never had opportunity to discuss the subject here.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Your good mother, Persephone... dread Queen of the Underworld! I certainly misjudged her when we had occasion to interact whilst she resided on Olympus. Perhaps I, too, should consider a life there in your realm...",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You bear Varatha, the Eternal Spear...! I thought it lost! Have you any idea how many lives it drank during your father's glory days?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, you wield Coronacht, the Heart-Seeker. It pierced three Titans in one shot back in the war amongst our kind. Please do take care of it!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You have the Shield of Chaos, Aegis... quite unlike the one my good sister Athena likes to flash around. You have much better taste.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Why, you are wielding Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! A most fascinating device. Imagine the new face of war, should its secrets someday be revealed, and spread to mortalkind!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Well if it isn't Malphon, the Twin Fists, bound to your very capable hands! So many weapons are so indirect, I think. With Malphon, you are about as close to the destruction as can be.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The greatest wars require great alliances, my kin. And so, I shall entrust to you some of the greatest methods of destruction I've devised thus far.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The winds of war blow fiercely on the surface now, my kin. Thus I am able to confer upon you even greater power than has been my custom.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You seem to be upon the verge of death, my kin. I cannot wait to hear of it! The experience of death, time after time! You are one of a kind!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, my kin, but you have suffered terribly to come this far. No matter, for we soon shall pay your enemies in kind.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"So much letting of blood, so much of it, your own. Let's see to keeping you alive and in the fight a while longer, then.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You're on the verge of yet another brush with death, I see, my hell-born kin. Do send some others down with you, would you?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"A mortal surely would have already succumbed to injuries such as the ones you've suffered, there. Impressive how you carry on, like that.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
This one was bound to show up I guess. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You've got quite the fighting spirit in you there, I have to say. Most intriguing, and yet no surprise for someone born in hell itself. You come on out of there, and tell me all about it. I'm a fellow student of death, you see.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I must say you deal death rather exquisitely. Though, perhaps I could be of some further assistance in such matters, yes?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Ah! I figured that you must have been the source of all that bloodshed underneath the earth. Let me see if I can make your death-dealing a little more efficient.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Well, my hell-born kin, my blessing now is yours to do with as you wish; provided you inflict a little suffering for me?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I've just the thing for you this time, my kin. May I present my instruments of pain?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I surely hope your bloodshed's going well, and long that there shall be no end to it. I am, as ever, here to serve your benefit.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"How fares your endless war against the dead? Let it be known that I am happy to take sides in such affairs. Please, I insist!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Death rears its head in all too many forms, I'm sure you know. Though you may never find them all, I nonetheless encourage you to try.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The wretched dead you face perhaps forget themselves. Go, then, remind them of the agony which brought them to your realm.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Life and death are inextricable, and war is often what connects the two. Don't you agree?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"This world has a limitless capacity for pain; and so, it truly is no inconvenience to help you to bring out a little more.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The living and the dead alike desire what I represent. Their appetite for bloodshed cannot easily be sated. A goal to strive for, no?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Perhaps the dead you stand against have long forgotten the experience of anguish and despair. I trust that you shall soon remind them for me?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Beautiful, isn't it? The strife which follows you. You have a real knack for this, and I for one am happy to assist.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Some would question the destruction which you sow, but I shall never do so. I fully understand your impulses. Allow me to indulge them.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Not once has your Lord Father thanked me for delivering vast portions of his clientele. Surely you shall be more grateful for my gifts.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Do you suppose the dead feel pain unlike the living? This is for me an endless fascination, so go on, and give me more to think about.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"As you continue waging war against the dead, I gladly lend you my support; family to family, no questions asked.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
It is a veritable crime your father distances himself from all the rest of us. It is fortunate that you yourself are not so disagreeable.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Let us together deal some death, shall we?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Shall we continue our campaign against the dead?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"What do you say we bring the dead some pain, for old time's sake?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
The devastation you have caused has not escaped my notice!,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"We stand before a golden opportunity, to inflict pain. Let us proceed!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
There is no problem war cannot sort out.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah there you are, my kin! I have a gift to aid your bloody work.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"My blessing be with you, and may death follow in your wake.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Please spread some suffering down there for me, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
I shall empower you to acts of greater violence than before.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"War needn't carry out solely above the earth, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
I trust that the destruction which you sow is going well?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The recent devastation which you caused, that was impressive work.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Whenever you bring death, why, you've my full support.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"How fares the ceaseless slaying of your foes, quite well, my kin?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Perhaps my blessing shall let you deliver death still more efficiently.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Your father's realm shall be quite full, I think, once you and I are through.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
The finest instruments of death at my disposal shall be yours.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
I'd like to offer you a choice amongst my most exquisite tools which inflict suffering.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"What say we start our next war with a special flair, my kin?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I've not seen ample blood spilled recently, so let's please make up for lost time.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"There are so many types of death... and yet, the sudden, violent kind is unsurpassed, I think.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I am quite eager to commence jointly killing your enemies, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"What do you say we start another of our famous killing sprees, my kin?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"It's not been long since last I saw bloodshed... but far too long for me, nevertheless.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"My finest implements of death I now avail to you, my worthy kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Let us make this blood-letting truly one to remember, then, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"May you sow such destruction as to shake this mountain to its core, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I shall now give to you the means to wreak such havoc there, my kin!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I was quite pleased to hear again from Nyx of late, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"May the wondrous goddess Nyx continue to watch over you, and darken the eyes of your foes.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"To think you have the goddess Nyx's aid, as well as mine!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I knew that foul boatman would come through, and you would find amongst his wares this gift!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I give to you this token of respect, buried though it must have been within the boatman's hoard.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
I trust the river-boatman Charon has been keeping plenty busy lately thanks to me?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The boatman Charon ought invest into a boat of more substantial size if he's to keep up with my work, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Your boatman there is a reliable deliverer of death, it seems. And that makes three of us, I think.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You reject my generous offering of aid? Hahahaha, you must not know me very well. Death shall come, regardless, either to your enemies, or you.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You would deny such aid as I would offer you? How rather disappointing. You've more to learn about the art of dealing death, it seems.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"An incorrect decision, there, my kin, to side against me thus. Blood needs be shed, and yours is going to suffice.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"It seems unwise of you to thus dismiss my offering. Suffer, then, a while by my hand.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Your choice leaves much to be desired here, my kin. My temper I shall keep in check, but only barely so.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"A disappointing choice, my kin, and there are consequences to such choices, every single time.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Your course of action here was ill-advised, my kin. For war shall come to you no matter what, as I shall presently reveal.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The whims of our kind are unpredictable, my kin. But you shall find responses to such acts to be the definition of consistency.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I'll not abide such disregard of our past companionship, my kin. In war, one must take sides, and you had best choose mine.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"War shall be waged here, no matter what, my kin. But even still, I am dismayed you would have sided against me.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You wish to have a taste of what a war against me would be like? Well, then, I shall oblige.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Did I detect some hesitancy on your part just then? Perhaps you knew that you were making a mistake. No matter; you'll learn now.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You shall not goad me into anger with a petty insult such as this, you know. Nevertheless, there is a price which must be paid for it.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Apologies, Lord Ares.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ares, forgive me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't kill me, Ares.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sorry, Lord Ares.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"A sacrifice in blood is fully paid, and we are squared away. Though think you twice next time before you cross me, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Well haven't you withstood my murderous intent! Resilience as this deserves reward, and I am feeling rather generous.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"It is not often I attempt to kill someone and they survive. Bravo! Our score is settled up for now, so let us carry on as friends.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You capably survived my wrath, and I commend you for it. Let us continue on, as friends and kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I think that we are squared away, for now. Though, do not test my patience further, hm?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You crossed the fields of death impressively back there. Though, you are fortunate I'm in a giving mood.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"When blood is spilled and death is dealt, I simply cannot remain discontented for too long.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"What I could see of that display of violence you just sowed was thoroughly commendable, my kin. Then, here.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Your sacrifice to me just now has moved me to forgiveness for the time; thus shall we call a truce.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"A war can only last so long, my kin. This one is not worth the pursuit, I think, when we can wage a greater one, together.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Ah, after a show of violence such as that, how can I possibly remain upset, my kin?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Your slight against me is already forgotten; for I was more than pleased to witness such a monstrous show of force.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Lord Ares, please accept this offering, for giving me such strength as necessary to succeed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are a flatterer, my death-inflicting kin. And I am feeling generous, as well, so here! A small token for you of my affection.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Lord Ares, I honor you for all the strength you've given me to overcome my foes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Such a splendid offering, to me! How very thoughtful, there, my kin. I am taken aback, though I accept!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Lord Ares! Please accept this token of my deep appreciation for your generous support.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"An offering, for me? Indeed! How gracious that you keep me in your thoughts. Know that, likewise, I keep you in mine.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Lord Ares, it is my privilege to have met you, and have learned your death-inflicting way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I do appreciate this gift to me, although you really shouldn't have! The suffering which you inflict is ample compensation in itself.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You have shown me nothing but respect and granted me your favor repeatedly, Lord Ares. This is the least that I can do, in kind.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Most often when I'm given offerings, it is with wishes that I lend my favor in a coming war. Yet from you, my kin, I sense no such motive. I'm quite taken aback by that, I must admit.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Lord Ares! As bloodshed has become somewhat of a necessity in my situation, I am very grateful that you're with me in this. I know never to take it for granted.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're most gracious with me, my kin; and I remain enthralled as ever by your blood-soaked way of life. I trust the violence I have wrought on your behalf has been quite satisfactory?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"I offer this Ambrosia in your name and honor, Lord Ares. To the god of war! How many foes have I vanquished with your aid and guidance? But more than that, I'm pleased to know you, and to be your cousin.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, such an exquisite gift this is, indeed. Yet, the destruction you have sown, the sheer carnage... nothing can surpass that, I should think. Should you ever go to war, my kin... genuinely go to war, I mean... do look me up. I imagine I would take your side.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"You have my thanks, Lord Ares.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Pain and suffering upon you all!,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Blood and death, together hand in hand!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Death and destruction!,CHARACTER,Ares,male
Now I am angry.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Perish, all of you!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
Behold the violence!,CHARACTER,Ares,male
Suffer and die!,CHARACTER,Ares,male
War is inevitable!,CHARACTER,Ares,male
Whom do you take me for.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
You test my patience.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
Disgusting.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
How dare you.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"A compelling offer, Lord Ares.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"A shrewd exchange, Lord Ares.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Lord Ares, I accept.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That was ill-advised.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
A terrible mistake.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
A foolish move.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
You must know mercy simply isn't in my nature.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
What is a war without its tragic losses here and there?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
It is unwise to side against me in a war.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Hail, my kin.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Greetings, fellow bringer of death and so on.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
How is hell treating you today?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
How fares your war against the dead?,CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Greetings, it is I.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
This is for you.,CHARACTER,Ares,male
Lady Artemis...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You found me, Artemis...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tsk, um, Zagreus... rather than greet you as I normally would do, instead, allow me to present you my illustrious, kind, generous lord father, your greatest Uncle Zeus!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Erm, thank you for the introduction, Daughter! Now, you run along, go frolic with your nymphs, or something! Leave me to assist my nephew, here. Bestow on him your faint blessing, if you must.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"You know my father and my uncle, by now, right, Zagreus? I don't know which of them is worse. Uh, I mean... superior! Superior, despite technically spending most of his time in the seas, beneath Olympus, isn't that right, Uncle?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh, Artemis, you needn't boast to little Hades there on my account! Besides! Whether you're in the sea, above it, or beneath, makes little difference to your measure as a god! You two are young as yet! Keep at it, and you'll soon be practically as great as I!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hey, uh, Zagreus! There's something I've been wondering, and don't take this the wrong way or anything, OK? Oh, no. It's her.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Why, Artemis, you're absolutely tongue-tied! Due to our little godling in the Underworld, or a little due to me? Hm-hm, you shall figure it all out I'm sure!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Look, what was I, ugh, just, never mind. I'll talk to you some other time, I guess.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Erm, Zagreus, despite my hunter's instincts here, it seems I was unable to elude Aphrodite in this particular case, who insisted that we present ourselves to you at the same time, for whatever reason...",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh, come now, Artemis! I'm sure you're very capable of hiding from a common beast, but I can see you plain. Why not be honest with yourself, next time?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Zagreus, I wish we all could hear you so that good Lord Ares here might be persuaded that my powers are entirely for different purposes than his!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Perhaps our skillsets once were meant for different purposes, dear Artemis; but who are we to doubt the end result? Observe what shall transpire once we grant our kin our combined might.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Zagreus, I was just hoping for a little privacy before this hunt, which is consistently my preference here, except, you see, Lord Ares always seems to come sniffing about, first sign of any hunting instruments!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Why, my dear Artemis, the hunt is but a prelude to a war, is that not so? For if all mortalkind knew naught of hunting, why, they would not be nearly so adept at killing one another.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Look, Lord Ares, if I lend you better marksmanship ability, you think that you could bother someone else?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh, great, it's you, Zagreus! Here, let me offer you some fine new Boons, as well as Lord Dionysus here, who I am sure would love to talk your ear off just as much as mine!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Eh, tells me I'm being awful loud, and to back off, all sorts of nasty stuff like that, what can you do, though, right?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Oh, hi there, Zagreus, I was just failing to persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up off the snowy stretch that we've been having for a while. Some of the mortals are quite weary of it now, and it sure doesn't make the hunting any easier!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The mortals are resourceful, Artemis. Their one redeeming quality, perhaps! They'll find a way through our long winter here. They ought to, since they brought it on themselves.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Um, Zagreus, did you attempt to chat with Coronacht just yet? Remember, tell the bow I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! Something good's supposed to happen if you do, some divine archer-person's aspect I should think? You going to try it soon, or not?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, look at that! The message must have worked! Practically can see that shiny bow from here! I've never wielded Coronacht myself, at least not yet. Though if the Fates are sending visions to me of its past or future bearers, why, I guess I'm bound to get my shot eventually!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Found you, Huntress, here. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Especially for you, Lady Artemis!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Some kind of special message for me...! Oh, looks like there's one for everybody on Olympus, then. Felt rather special for a moment, there! And now you're making me check in with all the others. Great!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Have to say, I had a pretty decent time with everybody at our little visit recently! Met you, Uncle Hades, even great Achilles! Still don't quite appreciate you tricking us, but eh! I can get over it eventually. Anyway, you still could use assistance from me, right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Ah, good old Father Zeus, he must have blessed you with his lightning bolts, did he? Always looking out for everyone.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Uncle Poseidon blessed you, didn't he. To think that big, fat oaf is your own father's brother. I'm told to be respectful near him, but it's hard.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You met Athena earlier, I guess? I'd never trade my bow for all that pomp and armor, but... I guess to each her own.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You're pretty close with Ares, aren't you? And here they said it couldn't be done. If I were you I'd watch myself with him.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"So Aphrodite reached you first, did she? Sounds exactly like something she'd do. She has a knack for trouble. So, let's just stay focused, here!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"That lush and lecher, Dionysus, counts you as a friend? I'm hoping that there must be some mistake, yeah, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You seem particularly light on your feet, there, Zagreus. I'd figure Hermes, himself, was speeding you along, except I've not seen him about in... been a while, really.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"So even Demeter's become involved in this! Didn't think she would. Though you'll be glad she did! Provided you stay on her warm and fuzzy side, of course. Working on that, myself!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Something's troubled me a little, about you. You fight so desperately. At first I thought you simply lacked in patience. But now I see it's urgency that drives you. What is it that you're after, really...?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Let's see. You blundered headlong into danger for the past six chambers or more. And you made such a racket I could almost hear it from Olympus. I have to say, your hunting skills are rather unconventional.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I'm with you every step till you arrive here, Zagreus. Then I will probably ignore you like the rest. Just warning you ahead of time, all right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Say, were you hunting vermin near the surface lately, Zagreus? That's practically just like the real thing! It must have been a thrill!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You've become a right accomplished vermin hunter, Zagreus! Maybe you'll get to use those skills against worthier creatures soon enough.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"That Fury down in Tartarus has been a real problem, hasn't she. I see the huntress instinct in her. She thinks she knows your weaknesses. Don't let yourself become predictable.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, I once heard Lord Hades has in his employ the greatest hero of the Trojan War, you happen to know anything about that? I'm kind of a fan. You see Achilles, tell him he's the best for me!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"So, I have heard that Achilles, himself, taught you how to fight! No wonder you can hold your own down there, that is amazing...! You be sure to honor him from time to time, got it?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Living on Olympus here, I'm surrounded by my family, but I always felt alone. I know that's not the same as your experience, but, I'm just saying I relate to what you're going through.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I think you might enjoy it on Olympus, there's... a lot of feasting here, I guess, and the air is cool and crisp, and it's much brighter than it is down there. Sounds like a dream, right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I hope that once you make it to Olympus we'll go hunting sometime, you and I, you know? I like being on my own and all, but it's been nice, talking to you like this.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I grow so tired of the others here, you know? Much rather be out with the woodland nymphs than with these gods upon this mountaintop. You must know what it's like.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Not everybody on Olympus is a total disappointment, Zagreus. Why, someday maybe you could meet Callisto, she goes hunting with me all the time! Bet you don't see many woodland nymphs down there.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey Zagreus, that Nectar you sent? Callisto and the nymphs and I, we popped it open recently, and it was really good! Had us positively frolicking about. So, thanks!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You must have a friend or two, don't you? It's hard being alone all of the time. At least I have Callisto and the other nymphs, and... I have you! A distant friend is still a friend, isn't that right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hope you don't mind, I told Callisto all about you recently! Don't worry, I was quite discreet about it, the two of us were on the hunt, not like I just shouted out your story from the mountaintops!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Zagreus, if only you could turn yourself into a woodland creature and just fly or burrow out of there! My Callisto, she can turn into a bear, you ever seen those? Monstrous, furry things, quite huggable, if they don't kill you first!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You've never even seen the woods, have you? I hope you do, someday. You could meet Callisto and the others! It's quite beautiful, and green, and calm, it's... anyway.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Don't know what it is about you, Zagreus, but I feel like I can be me with you, you know? Maybe it's that you don't constantly talk over me like everybody else, besides Callisto and the nymphs I guess. Not that I can even hear you, but, you know what I mean, right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, how'd you get your hands on a nice bow like that? You take good care of Coronacht for me, so I can try it too once you're up here.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Have to admit, you're very capable with Coronacht. Now I can hit a bull's eye in my sleep, but you'll be right there with me if I don't keep practicing I think!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, that's the Eternal Spear, Varatha, isn't it? Your father used to use that, didn't he. A bit ornate for hunting, but a spear's a spear, is what I like to say!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, that can't possibly be the spear once wielded by the great Achilles, there, can it?! The shape is unmistakable, I mean, have you even the slightest just how many mortals got completely slaughtered by that thing? Oh, it has seen some use!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"That's not the Coronacht I know, isn't that... Chiron the centaur's bow? So that was Coronacht, as well? Seems every decent bow was just a version of that thing! Except for mine, of course.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Say, that's the bow Stepmother Hera herself once wielded, isn't it? Her aspect of Coronacht! I'd know it from the... frankly rather sinister skulls all over it. It's very Hera, trust me.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"When did you get your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists? Hands in, I ought to say! I heard that one time, Demeter, she smacked her father right square in the face with those! Bet you can probably relate.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Well, look at you, with Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! Seems much too noisy-complicated as a hunting weapon when you could just use a nice quiet bow, but hey, to each her own.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Now listen, Zagreus, admittedly this is a little strange, even from me. I have a message for your bow! That's right, just go on up to Coronacht next time, and tell it with a firm, commanding voice, I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! Let me know how it goes, OK?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, that's my Adamant Arrowhead on you! Normally, it's for killing things, but in your case it makes it even easier for me to hunt you down, even in the dark. Now that I found you... here!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Your name, it means 'great hunter', Zagreus! I guess your mother Nyx must have expected someday that you'd pick up a few pointers from myself!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, hold a moment, Zagreus, I could have sworn... you were so close, before, but now you're back? Ah, must have tripped up just when victory was close at hand, it happens all the time. We'll get you out of there, you'll see!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, you all right there, Zagreus? Wouldn't do to have you die on me just moments after meeting here like this.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh! Look at you, you're hurt there pretty bad, but, just stay focused on the hunt, and it'll help to keep the pain at bay.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Look, I'm just goddess of the hunt, not medicine, so... I don't know if this is going to help right now, but, here!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Your hunt has evidently not been going very well so far, I see. Though, maybe we can still turn it around.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Well, one good thing about all of the blood you've lost is it was even easier to track you down this time!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"All right, get ready for this, Zagreus, because I seldom share the greatest of my hunting secrets like I am about to.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"All right, no need to keep on toying with your prey. Here comes one of my finest blessings, now!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I don't reveal my greatest hunting techniques for just anybody, Zagreus, so you better appreciate what you're about to get, and use it to go far!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"How about we not take any chances this time, Zagreus? So here, this is the best I've got. You better not waste it!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"There's only one heavenly archer I know of. Well, several, really. Anyway! In the name of Hades! Olympus? I accept this message.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I heard about you. Look, I'm not like all the others on Olympus. The power of the hunt helps keep me company, so... maybe it'll help you, too!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey. You're not alone. You're not alone down there, OK? Here, let me show you.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The dead must make a rather easy target, wouldn't you say? Let's see what you can do to them, given your choice of these.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You busy, Zagreus? Thought maybe I could interest you in some of these old hunting tricks of mine.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"How fares the hunt this time around, OK? I bet it could be better, so, erm, here! Maybe this'll help.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Let's take a little hunting expedition, yeah? You'll do most of the work, but hey, I'll be with you in spirit!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Sorry you're still stuck down there. Sometimes I feel stuck myself, but, a good hunt always sets me straight.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"When I am on the hunt, my mind is clear, and nothing stands between me and my target. Though, have a blessing just in case you can't relate!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
I'd love to know about your life down there. I'll try and help you live through it this time so that way you can tell me?,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The wretches whom you face down there have died already, sometimes more than once. Should make for easy targets, right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I've never come across a target I couldn't take down. I expect the same of you, you hear me? Hopefully you hear me.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Good hunting, Zagreus! The sooner you get out of there the sooner you can save me from my insufferable relatives. Please?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, Zagreus, good luck out there, this time. I'd tell you 'may your aim be true' but I can guarantee it, actually.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The hunt requires utter concentration, so, I'll leave you to it, and... just watch your every move in silence over here...",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You want to make it out of there, you... don't have to listen to a word I say, to be quite honest, but... my huntress blessings ought to help.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Well, Zagreus, you getting out of there this time, or am I going to have to keep on hunting by myself for the time being? Probably?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Looks to me like you could use a little help, so I'll just have a look in my big bag of blessings here, and, oh! Here's just the thing.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The hunt comes down to kill-or-be-killed. Except for us immortals, who have to live with our shame, which is worse?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Those wretched things harassing you throughout that Underworld just won't give up, will they? Well, just keep killing them, I guess!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Need a hunting partner, Zagreus? Not that I'm able to join you myself down there, or even hear you respond for that matter, but, anyway, here.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Zagreus, it's me! I'm here to join the hunt with you again. Let's show them what we can do.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hello again, you ready for this hunt? Me, I've been looking forward since last time, so, let's get on with it.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Stay on your guard, tread lightly, and all that.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Keep a sharp eye out there, won't you?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Good hunting down there, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"What are you hunting this time, I wonder.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
I'll be looking out for you. If you don't mind of course.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Remember, Zagreus, kill-or-be-killed.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"How about I join you for this hunt, OK?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey, you take care of yourself, all right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Got you something I bet you could use.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The finer points of hunting are not easy to communicate, though you're learning from experience, at least!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
My senses sure are going to be sharp if I keep trying to keep up with you like this in all that dark down there.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"A good, clean shot is all it takes, most of the time!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You getting anywhere down there yet, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"What are you waiting for, let's get to hunting, then!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Not much of a hunt when your prey knows exactly where you are, but it'll do!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I hope your every strike cuts to the vital bits of all your prey, there, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I brought some hunting gear for you to try, if you could give me your attention, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"All right, Zagreus, catch your breath, decide, and then what say we get you out of hell maybe?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"What are we hunting this time, Zagreus? Don't tell me wretched dead, again?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You see how easily I tracked you down? Unless you went out of your way for me, that is?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I have a Boon for you, here, Zagreus, though just be sure you don't embarrass me.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Well, perfect timing, Zagreus, now stock up and head out.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You want to make it out of there, my Boons are just about the only way to go.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Don't you let your father or let anybody push you around, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Bet I can help you break out of your father's realm in no time, Zagreus!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Decided I would pack you something extra for this hunt, if you can handle it!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Enough toying around with our prey, there, Zagreus. What do you say we finish it, this time?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I know it must be such a struggle for you, Zagreus, so here! In case this helps.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"A great hunter ought to have great tools, Zagreus, so here! Please allow me.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Wish I could hunt with you myself, but here's the next best thing, all right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
You know how long it took Callisto to become a master of the hunt? I'm sure you can still learn a thing or two!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I was about to head out with Callisto for a hunt, though I can spare you a quick Boon, I guess!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I have to meet Callisto soon, but it won't take me but a moment here to get you on your way!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Someday perhaps you'll join me and Callisto for a hunt! But as for now...,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Greetings to you from the forest! Callisto and the woodland nymphs say hi!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You'd make a real asset on the hunt, I think. Not that Callisto and I need assistance, though.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You know, one thing I'll say for Charon there? He doesn't talk too much. And since neither do you, I'm letting you have this.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I guess this means you must have paid the boatman's ransom here, and whatever price he charged you, it was worth it.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Even there in your Underworld, it seems quality hunting gear doesn't come cheap, apparently!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"If you're quite done with shopping, Zagreus, what say we cut straight to the chase from here?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You hunted down a real bargain there in Charon's shop, though how about we try a slightly bigger deal on for size right now?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Why would you side with...?! Ugh, why do I even bother with some lesser god!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I thought we had an understanding, Zagreus. But, this wouldn't be the first time I was wrong about someone.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Huh, so that's your choice! Maybe you're more like my relatives than I'd care to admit.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Good shot, there, Zagreus! I guess you got me. Now why don't you go take a shot at this.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Don't be messing with my feelings, Zagreus. My loyalty's hard-won, and quickly lost.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You really missed an easy shot, here, Zagreus. But I will not. You'll see.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Ah, good! Just when I had almost forgotten what an arrow to the back felt like!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Am I some kind of pushover to you, Zagreus? Is that what you think?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh, look, turns out it's time for target practice once again! Start running, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"What made you think I'd stand for this, from you?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Ah-hah, I knew you'd pull this old maneuver, Zagreus. And I am ready for you, now.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You're getting quite predictable when you betray me like this, Zagreus! Start running, then.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh really, that's the way it's going to be? You Underworld gods are all alike!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Forgive me, Lady Artemis.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sorry, Artemis.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No hard feelings, Lady Artemis?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Had to do it, Artemis.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Fine, I'm not angry anymore, not really anyway, but you just watch yourself with me, you got it?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh you're still there I see. Well then, all right, let's call it even for the moment and get on with this.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"All right, all right, I'm going to forgive you now I guess, no need to beg, you just think twice next time OK?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Got to say you handled yourself pretty well back there. I can't stay mad after a show like that.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Good hunting just now, Zagreus. You passed my little test, so now we're good, just like it never happened.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"So you survived, so what. Here, why not take a Boon, and then be off?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I will admit mistakes were made back there, so you just don't make them again, next time all right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You know what, I decided not to kill you, Zagreus. No sport in cornered prey, so here, get on with it.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Good thing you're nowhere near our mountaintop or I'd have shot you for that stunt, myself.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Well, Zagreus, it turns out you need all the help that you can get, so here's a pity Boon for you!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I could keep hunting you until you're dead, but there's too little meat on you to make it worth my while.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Lady Artemis, I hope that you'll accept this offering, for all your kindness and support.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey thank you for this, really. And, I've just the thing to offer in return. It's just a gift, OK?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"My lady Artemis! This is nothing, next to all your grace and favor.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey wait, this is an offering, for me? I, oh, that's very kind, though, let's get back to hunting, now, OK?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Lady Artemis! I am indebted to you, for the strength and cunning you have given me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, Zagreus, I don't know what to say, except for... thanks!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"My lady Artemis, your favor's been invaluable to me. No finer huntress ever walked the surface of the earth, or underneath.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're being very nice to me, and that makes me suspicious, understand? So, you want more of that... you keep this up.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"At the risk of incurring your wrath, Lady Artemis, I hope you will accept this from me, and see that my gratitude for all you have done for me is genuine.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What do you know, another gift of Nectar, that's... quite thoughtful of you, Zagreus! Normally don't care much for the stuff, but, every now and then, I mean... why not?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"In your honor, Lady Artemis! Your mighty blessings have helped me through so many trials now, and I always welcome your level-headed presence here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, I like being worshiped just as much as anybody, Zagreus, though bear in mind that you can always leave the worship of me to the forest nymphs, all right?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I know you have no shortage of Ambrosia on Olympus, Lady Artemis, but I imagine it's less often that the stuff go all the way from there to here, and back. What can I say? You make me proud to be a member of this family.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I never felt like I could be myself with everybody on this mountaintop, you know? So much posturing, and bickering, and... I just head out to the woods most of the time. Maybe you understand me better than the rest, I've no idea still. But I appreciate you've made attempts to try.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Lady Artemis, you honor me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nowhere to hide from me!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Picked up their scent!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
I'll take care of this!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Care to hunt with me?,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Artemis,droppedFemale
Oh hi remember me?,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
You got it.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Artemis,droppedFemale
Understood.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Artemis,droppedFemale
I have them in my sights!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"I hear you, firing!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
They are as good as dead!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"All right, taking the shot!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
How dare you.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
What is the matter with you.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
What are you doing?,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
I can't believe this.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Is this some sort of joke?,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Sure, I don't see why not!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Oh let me get right on it, Zagreus!",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Pray I don't accidentally miss my mark!,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"A keen offer, Lady Artemis.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"A tempting offer, Lady Artemis.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Lady Artemis, I accept.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You may be good at running, Zagreus, but you're bad at hiding.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"You make me mad, I'll hunt you like a stag. You heard of those?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Don't anger me next time, won't shoot you dead, is it a deal?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"How goes it, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Hey it's me again.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Care to hunt with me?,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Glad you're still in one piece.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Now here's something for you.,CHARACTER,Artemis,female
Lady Aphrodite...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hi, Aphrodite.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dearest, your lord uncle wishes to address you from our mountaintop, although I had assured him that the two of us, we had everything well under control!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Come now, Zagreus, the only thing Lady Aphrodite has under control is her long list of salivating suitors, am I right? Aphrodite, how about you bestow your blessing and be off, and I'll take it from here.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"The thing to know about this family, dearest, is that, each of us, we have our little quirks. Although, we always stick together and our love for one another perseveres!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, hoh! What do we have here, little Hades? Seems to me that you have company! Well, I'll just leave the two of you alone. My lips are sealed tighter than a warship hull!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh, feel free to stay, Poseidon! I was just explaining what an idiot you are, though you're able to articulate this best! Anyway, dearest, what was I on about...?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You must forgive us, little godling, meaning our extended family here upon Olympus! Some of us are terribly stuck up, and must be making matters much more complicated than they have to be.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I wonder, dearest Aphrodite, whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Oh, you must know full well that I would do much more than that directly to your countenance, Athena dear! Quite frankly, you could use a lot of work!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Dearest, you must know, Goddess Athena and myself, we don't always share a common view, perhaps because she overthinks things constantly, while my heart leads me on!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I'm glad we understand each other, then. It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I think for many of us, dearest, it can come as a surprise to learn that love and war often go hand in hand. Opposite forces, yet this connects them, doesn't it. The fiercest passions of gods and mortals! Isn't that right, Lord Ares?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Mortals are so bent on clinging to their lives, that many among them would gladly kill for it. The surge of emotion which they feel... one passion is no different from another, Lady Aphrodite, dear.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Oh dearest! I have brought you keen-eyed Artemis, who, in her focus on the hunt, has not developed social graces suitable enough to come to you herself!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Social graces, she says! Going about like that! I'm sure you know that I can find you when it's necessary, Zagreus. Though, how to get away from Aphrodite, I have no idea.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"My powers, dearest, oft go hand-in-hand with those of Dionysus, with his power to persuade the mind to find such beauty where it isn't, really!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Ah, haha, no need to flatter me like that, there, Lady Aphrodite! Beauty's almost entirely within the mind, I'm sure! And in the muscles and the jawline and the winning smile and, well, who am I to tell you, yeah?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"The venerable goddess of the seasons, Demeter, chooses to look as stately as can be, can you believe it, dearest? Although, why one would mark so many fine lines upon their face, I wouldn't know.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, Aphrodite, dear... you wouldn't know a thing of substance if it offered you a cloak. Your chosen countenance makes plain the full extent of your intentions, and your interests alike.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"OK, I think I'm ready. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! And I hope it finds you well, Lady Aphrodite!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Why, this is something, dearest! Such an enigmatic message you have sent. How positively captivating; I must know what it says. It bears the marks of others on Olympus, so... perhaps we ought to share some common knowledge on the subject, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, dearest, you've no idea what a delightful time I had while visiting you recently! So many new sights and sounds and smells, why, it was wonderful! And you are burdened with a big responsibility, aren't you? Mind if I lend my graces to you still from time to time...?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Lord Zeus has made acquaintances with you? Oh I sometimes forget that he's your uncle! His favor's well worth having, I assure you.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"That oaf Poseidon spoke to you already, didn't he? All bluster, muscles, and bravado, that one. I'm glad you're not the type.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You've met Athena, dearest, so you know not all the ladies on Olympus are alike. And I, for one, am grateful to our forebears for that!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I sense the mark of my Lord Ares on you, love. He's poorly understood among the gods, yet surely you can see fair qualities in him, and me?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"The sullen Artemis reached out to you, did she? Oh, that's adorable, dearest! Just don't make any sudden movements with her, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You are so fortunate to have received the Boon of Dionysus prior to my own! He, the most noble and important of us all, the god of wine, himself!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Why, did sorrowful old Demeter get all the way to you before I did? She stubbornly refuses me when I offer to help! Unlike you, little godling!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"How I love to have these unexpected little run-ins with you, love! You are just so spontaneous, and I've a liking for that sort of thing!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Keep following that heart of yours, dearest! It's good enough a guide, believe you me. Mine tells me you are going to succeed!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You do know that I'm married, don't you, love...? I'd forgive you if you didn't, for my husband, he's always... busy with his work. I'm grateful that you're there for me to talk to.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You're going to love it on Olympus, little godling. The air is beautiful and brisk, the gardens lush, the feasting plentiful...! Why, it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
What shall we do here once you finally arrive? Perhaps we could go out and meet some mortals! I know all too many maidens and/or noble gentlemen who'd absolutely love to get to know you.,CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"A little bird once told me that the shade of the great hero called Achilles now resides within your father's residence, dearest? I always wished to meet with him someday...",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You met Achilles after all, godling. He was quite instrumental in a war of my design. Still, he resisted my attempts to sway his actions. You tell him, simply, I admire him.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"The great hero Achilles, he continues to ignore my polite outreach, doesn't he? Why, I've attempted to reach out at least several times! Your father's realm is really quite a lot. How terribly frustrating it must be!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You've had a brush with Megaera, the Fury, haven't you? Oh I know a thing or two about that one. Though, lately we Olympians no longer mingle with those living in the Underworld. You're the only exception!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"A little birdy told me recently that you and Megaera the Fury, why, you've grown quite close! Now do be careful around her, and, try not to get attached, there, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Why, you have my Eternal Rose, don't you? I am so very touched that you'd think first of me among my mighty kin. It pleases me to know I'm in your thoughts!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh what is going on down there, dearest? I thought for certain you would make it out, but seems that nasty place has kept you grounded, hasn't it. But don't despair, and you take heart, won't you?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Something has stirred within your heart, dearest! Oh, I can always tell! A certain kind of love, for family? Yes, that must be it, I think! What could have transpired with you, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"To think your father and that sweet Persephone, they were together down there, all along! I was so certain that your father's heart was cold. That's just the thing with love, dearest! That, sometimes, it surprises even me!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"My dearest little godling, how fares everything with you of late? I love to have these little interactions with you, simple as they are, for they have brightened many of my evenings here.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Little godling, you must know the seven types of love by now, don't you? It's quite a complicated field, though several types intrigue me most of all. In fact, why, I have several types of love for you, right here!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Dearest, why... I sense your heart is very full, indeed! You positively emanate with love. You must have grown quite close to many dear to you. Perhaps so you may do the same with me...? I'm so delighted to have seen your spirit shine.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, my, dearest! I have to say, your heart is positively bursting with such love for so many you have come to care about! Your dearest friends, your burning passions, family, everyone! Why, you're like a living testament to my entire body of work!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I cannot help but wonder, dearest, why Lord Hades would have kept your mere existence hidden from us all this time. Perhaps he knew that, once you met us, you would stop at nothing to come seek us out!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I sense you finally acted on your pent-up passion for the Fury Megaera, yes, little godling? These types of things, they don't escape my notice, and they're always so enjoyable to see!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"How's fearsome Megaera the Fury treating you of late, hmm, dearest? I know her type so very well, indeed. She acts as though there's nothing that can get under her skin, isn't that right?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Mmm, so my heart tells me that you've developed quite the bond with moody Thanatos, haven't you, there? I always figured that his brooding quality was just an act!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Little godling, would that I knew every last detail of how you and Thanatos are getting on of late! The notorious incarnate of death, and the newly discovered son of Hades, fraternizing? It's positively scandalous I think!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Erm, dearest? If my perfectly developed senses are correct, then you appear to be quite smitten with a little gorgon that you've met down there...? Why that must be adorable, if rather strange!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Why, something's changed about the beating of your heart, dearest! Oh, it's the little gorgon, isn't it. You Underworld dwellers and your complicated feelings! I can never get enough. My blessings to the both of you, then, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, look at you, you poor, poor thing, you're hurt! Though, let me see if I can make it better.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Tsk, you're in no condition for an outing with me, dearest. Though, perhaps you might recover from your hardships with my aid?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Dearest, why, your heart rate's fluctuating wildly! Has it really been that bad up to this point? I'll try to help however much I can.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, you're just in an awful situation, aren't you. Yet, I can tell your proud heart keeps on beating, for the moment anyway! Don't die just yet!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Ah, little godling, you're about to die! Why, none of us want that, because if so, you won't get to enjoy my blessings here!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I have been waiting for a special moment to confess my great appreciation for your deeds... this moment's special enough, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"My loveliest of blessings is reserved only for those who've earned my deepest adoration. So, congratulations, love! And here you go!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Sometimes, our hearts become so full that they could burst! If only you could see how much I care. I would do anything to aid you in your plight! My heartfelt blessings be with you, dearest.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Little godling, you must know that the heart has infinite capacity for empathy. And I so feel for you there, that I have mustered for you some of the most beautiful of blessings I can offer!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I must be a mess, let's see here. Hi there! In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Why hello, hello, there, little godling. I have to say you're quite the specimen, and so, I've decided I shall aid you for the moment. You interested?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Did you miss me, little godling, hm? I thought I'd steal away a bit and that together we might make up for lost time.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Hello again, there, little godling, let's get to it, hm? I want what you want; there's no further need for words.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, boo, looks like you've rather got yourself into a bind, there, haven't you. Though, not to worry, dearest. I can pull some strings.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"There, there, dearest, you'll tell me all your troubles just as soon as you arrive, so let's just get you out of there for now.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"What is it, love, are you still having problems with the dead? I swear, you'd think they had enough of me in life!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"What did I miss since last time, anything of interest, hm? You'll have to fill me in once you break free, dearest.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Well, look at you, there, love! So well-prepared to take on any danger that may come! But, I must wonder, are you well-prepared for this?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Ready yourself, dearest, because you and I? We're going to have ourselves a little outing I expect that neither one of us shall soon forget.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Would you by any chance have room, there, in your heart for a most-gentle blessing from a goddess such as me?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Don't lose heart, now, little godling! I won't have you giving up before you get to see me in the flesh among the gardens of Olympus here...!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Dearest, I've known many gods and godlings through the ages. And, I have to say, you're quite intriguing, even for our kind.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, dearest, I suspect we'll have ourselves a most exciting time together, you and I! Just do your best and it'll all be fine!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I am always here, or close enough, to help you through whatever troubles you may face, my little godling. So do not hesitate to call upon me, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I'd ask you show me a good time, there, love, although I almost can't imagine a good time where you reside! So dreary, constantly!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I missed you terribly, my little godling! All that I ask is that you do not die on me again, why, I don't think that I can take it anymore!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"How you must yearn to reach the surface, little godling! It likewise stirs in me a yearning to assist you, by all means at my disposal!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"No need to worry any longer, dearest! I bring you strength and comfort, and I shall be watching every step of yours most carefully.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Ah, how I long to see you face-to-face! Until such time, however, this old means of keeping touch shall have to do. So you take care, now, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You know I would do anything to have you here among us, don't you, love? Oh, I just hope my blessings are enough...!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Love tends to blossom in the strangest places at the strangest times, you know that, don't you, dearest? All one can do is entertain the chance.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Don't work yourself too hard down there, you promise, little godling? We need you in good shape and spirits on Olympus here.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"What do you say we skip the chat and get right to it, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, would you look at whom I found, all by his lonely self.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Let's see what mischief we can make, between the two of us!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You want my blessings, dearest, here they are!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I hope I didn't keep you waiting very long, did I?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Even immortal hearts can break, my little godling.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"What do you say we go and make new friends together, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You seem like you could use a helping hand, there, love.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"The bond of love is strong enough to suffer any hardship, dearest.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Times of adversity make love grow even stronger, little godling.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I hate to see you struggling, dearest! Please do be careful, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female

"Looks like we meet again, dearest, here among the foul detritus of the boatman's wares! You truly take me to the best of places!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"At first I didn't know how to get through to that odd river-boatman, Charon. Turns out he lusts for coin, and now I understand him well!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You spent your hard-earned wealth on my account, dearest? Why if that isn't just the sweetest thing!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"One cannot put a price on love, but on my blessings, from the boatman, for my dearest? I'd say we're settled up.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"And here I was beginning to think that we had something special going, no...? Look here, little godling, let me save you lots of future suffering: I happen to be the jealous type.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You'd best not take for granted my affection, godling. Yes, I've lots of it to go around; but I can just as easily rescind such privileges.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"They say a lot of things about me, dearest; and they'll tell you, in your dealings with me, ample caution is in order. Let me show you why.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Don't ever take me for some thoughtless nymph to be manipulated, dearest. I expect reciprocal devotion from you. Do you understand?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, really? You shall find I don't take such rejections lying down. And you shall find it out the hard way.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"If it's your wish to test the limits of the fine relationship we've built, why then... I can confirm you're testing them, all right!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female

"Dearest, just in case it hasn't been made clear as crystal lately, let me tell you: When presented with the opportunity, don't ever reject me.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You'd spurn my love this easily, dearest? You are about to find the consequences are much harder to dismiss without a second thought.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I must admit I'm unaccustomed to rejection, love. But you must be accustomed to swift death! Here comes one for you now.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Oh, but this is such a heartbreak, dearest! Why would you do that? You know that I won't take this lying down.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You dare to play with my heart, little godling? I'll just take yours, and shatter it to pieces, then, I think!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Sometimes I think that you're quite different than most all the others here, darling. And then, you go and do something like this.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"You think you can brush me aside like that? Well, I think I can crush you into tiny, little bits! Let's see who's right, shall we?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female

"Oh, how I hate to fight with you like this! Let's forgive each other and forget, go back to how things used to be?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I'm not angry with you any longer, dearest! Though, might I suggest you take some extra steps to keep it that way, hm?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"A loving heart is a forgiving heart, don't you agree? So I shall let this little matter slide, and you've my loving heart to thank for it, hm-hm!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"The truth is I'm a lover, not a fighter, dearest. So how about we call this matter put to bed, and get on with our lives?",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I'd say this little squabble can be put to bed, for now. I'm better for the moment, but I was very angry with you, love!",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"I cannot bring myself to stay upset with you forever, little godling, so let's move along from that small misunderstanding there.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"There is no common sense with love, godling, so... why don't we pretend your indiscretion there did not occur.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
It is through times of difficulty that the love we share is tested and reforged. But you just watch yourself when testing it like that.,CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Love and jealousy go hand in hand, don't they, dearest? Although the former's much more pleasant, isn't it.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female

Lord Dionysus...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hello there, Dionysus...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Zag, my Dad, he's here and wants to have a word, be cool man, go along with what he says, OK?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"That Dionysus, always much too kind with introductions, though at least he shows me suitable respect. Perhaps someday he can instruct you in the customs of Olympus here.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Uh, Zag, erm... your uncle's passing through. Not Dad, erm, the other one I mean, and he just wanted to check in, see how you're doing, so...",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Ah-hah, there you are, my little nephew! Dionysus showing you the ropes, or what? You want a real feast, though, you just stick with me! Now take my blessing, go!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh, anyway we're here, man, waiting up for you! We know you're going to make it, I would say eventually?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, Zag, when you arrive, it's going to be a real scene, I'll tell you now! Even Athena here will cut loose for a bit, let down her hair, you know, put on something more comfy, yeah, it's going to be great!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Perhaps Lord Dionysus here is the true god of strategy, as it appears he is uncannily aware of my next move, Cousin. Although, be that as it may, I shall attempt to remain focused on your situation. Not his feast.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You know, Zag, maybe once you get here, you could get old Ares to just lighten up a little, you know, man? Always dragging down the mood, with talk of blood, and nastiness, all sorts of stuff like that!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Why, my Lord Dionysus! I fail to see why such discussion is perceived as unbecoming of a feast. A successfully conducted war is certainly a cause for celebration, is it not?",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Look, Zag, you should know by now that when it comes to feasting, it's Yours Truly here who puts on the best performance. But I do have Lady Aphrodite's help!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Wine does have a rather special way of making everybody look even more beautiful than ever, Dionysus dear! And from such beauty, why, long-lasting love is born! And also shorter-lasting love, much of the time.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Zag, man, I was just attempting here to get our good friend Artemis to finally make an appearance at one of my feasts, it's just... wouldn't you know, she's all preoccupied, something about a hunt?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"That's right, Lord Dionysus, a hunt! Which requires lots and lots of total quiet, and clear-minded focus. So, if you'll excuse me?",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hey Zag, got a favor here I mean to ask, could you maybe persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up on the whole 'not let anything grow' thing she's been going on about?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I daresay, my Lord Dionysus, that partaking of less wine for some amount of time might do you good. Regardless, you'll not coax a better crop from me.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Hope this lives up to your expectations, mate. In the name of Hades! Olympus? This is an official message! Should be a good time, Lord Dionysus!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, hold just for a moment, Zag, now, I can recognize an invite when I see one, man! And this is definitely almost certainly some sort of invite, one for me, and... one for everybody else, it looks like, here? Hoh, I'm excited, that is something really special, I can tell!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Look, Zag, I don't entirely recall what happened at that feast you threw for all of us down there, but let me tell you, I am under the impression it went smashingly! It was amazing, man! Let's have another one sometime, all right?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"So Zag, you met my dad by now, your uncle Zeus? He's cool and loves a feasting, just... be sure to keep him in your thoughts. OK?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hoh-ho, no way Zag, looking like you got yourself a gift from old Poseidon there? He's quite the catch, but here, hope you saved some room for more!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey man, I heard Athena had a word with you already yeah? She's cool, though, once you get to know her. Here! I got something that ought to suit her style.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Whoa, hey, you must have had a run-in with the lovely Aphrodite, am I right, or am I right, there Zag? But I have just the thing to go with her!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, Zag, got to tell you, I cannot believe that little Artemis is hanging out with you! She doesn't hang with anybody, man! But I digress, take this!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You hanging out with Ares, are you, Zag? He's quite the chap, I'll give him that, I'll give him that, and now, I'll give you this!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Felt a shiver in the air just now, and that can only mean that chilly Demeter decided to give you a little help, there, huh? Or maybe it's just cold, I mean, this is a mountaintop!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, Zag, uh... I may just be losing it or something here, but isn't that your dad's own blessing that you've got? That's something, man, I didn't know that he was helping you!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Now how's my favorite Underworld god surviving, Zag, you holding up or what? Right better momentarily, I bet!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Man oh man, Zag, someday you will be the guest of honor at the biggest feast that you have ever seen! Though I know you have got your hands full for the time, so, first things first!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Sometimes I have to wonder, man, what's going through your head, I mean, I know you hear me and the others but it's so damn dark down there I can't hear you at all!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Let me tell you something, Zag, I know your dad he's got to be a real handful, I relate to that, you understand me, mate? So you get out of there, and you'll be more than welcome here, with us!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I've got a feeling this time, man, like things are really going to take a turn for you, and I mean for the better, almost certainly, I think!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"The key to any halfway decent feast is lots and lots of preparation, man. Or maybe just having to improvise, you know?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I got to hand it to you, Zag, you don't back down, you don't ever back down, what is this, like the twentieth time that you've attempted to escape?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You're getting somewhere, getting somewhere, man, I understand you made it up to Asphodel before, now that is progress, keep it up, you keep on going, yeah?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Heard you wrestled with some Satyrs near the surface, Zag! Nice work making it that far, and I just want to let you know that they are definitely not my crew, man! Satyrs I know aren't like that at all!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Ah, Zag, what happened last time, man? It seemed like you were rather close, but then, we couldn't see you anymore from here, and now you're back? Well, give another go!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Want you to know something, here, man. It's been a bit of a long haul, but you are getting closer to the surface, and you'll get there someday, and we're with you, however long it takes, OK?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, back when we had that feast, there, man, I, I hope I didn't, you know, make for any inconveniences or anything down there, did I...?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Zag, I cannot believe your mom's Persephone, that's something else, I got to tell you, man! I never took her for the sort to be all into Underworld stuff!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Say, isn't that the Overflowing Cup I handed down to you, I'm glad you like it, man! I guess it's overflowing still, because I figure otherwise I couldn't tell at all!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You, man, must be mates with just about everybody down there, by now, yeah? Doling out Nectars left and right, just livening the place right up!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Say, let me just point out you've got a lot of Nectar on you, man! Oh, I can tell, I like the stuff a lot, myself, but even I don't pack that much, and I mean, wow!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Say, man, if I'm not mistaken, I think you got yourself a bottle of Ambrosia, there? I'd no idea you could get that stuff downstairs! Do me a solid, though, hang on to any more you find, or better yet, give it away! I'd hate to think even a drop has gone to waste!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Well, would you just look at yourself, Zag! You are like a walking stockpile of Ambrosia, aren't you? Taking the best care of it, at that. I knew I could count on you, but... <Sniff> I didn't know I could be just so proud of you, you know, man?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Zag, turns out I am quite the judge of character, and you, man, have an awful lot of it, I mean, you've given out how much Ambrosia now? To all your mates, and more?!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You got to let me in on something, Zag, how did you gather up so much Ambrosia, there? I mean, sometimes I think the stuff is plentiful up here, but you are positively swimming in it, man!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You are the talk of the mountain, you know that, man? Good on you, getting on just about everybody's good side up here, I mean, that is a feat, all right!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey Zag, ever see a fellow by the name of Orpheus down there, you ever heard of him? I bet you have, and I have had a funny thought, a little jest that maybe we could try, if you'd be up to have a little harmless fun?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Harmless fun at the expense of Orpheus? You have my full and complete attention, Dionysus mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Hahaha, Zag! I heard you got to Orpheus, he's got this whole entire ballad now, about how you are really me, or maybe it's the other way around, I've no idea, hahahaha! Here!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Zag, I heard that Orpheus, he found his missing bride, why, isn't that the sweetest thing, isn't it, man? I'll drink to that, and I think so should you!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Erm, hey, man, you been having some bad run-ins with that Fury, Megaera, is that her name? Now isn't she a real firebrand! Maybe this'll help you out next time you meet!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Whoa, Zag, heard you're hanging with the Fury Megaera of late, well cheers to that, man, bet she's something else, but you just watch for that whip of hers, OK?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey man, I'm hearing up here that you got in good with Megaera, the Fury, is that right, I mean, I hope it is, because, hahaha, yeow, know what I mean? They say she's something else!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, you're in good with Thanatos, isn't that right? A real broody sort, sometimes I think maybe I ought to just invite him to a feast, but then, what if he cools the whole thing down, makes everybody kind of ehhhhh, you know?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Heard that you took care of Theseus down in Elysium of late, there, Zag! Nice work, never liked that one, between us. There's this nice lass helped him out one time, and he just dumped her rotten, I don't like that, man!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male

"Hey, cheers to you, and everything you do, there, Zag! Only the best from me to you, man!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Heeey, what's, uh, with that Charon, man, he's sort of, I-don't-know, though I am glad he's been of service!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Ah-hah, you found me holing up in Charon's nasty stash there did you man, well good, good, here!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Looks like you are stocked for one hell of a night down there, man! I knew Charon would hook you up with what you need!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, cheers for picking up the tab, there, Zag, now, I cannot exactly pay you back, though I could give you this!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I bet that Charon has to be the life of every feast you have down there, with such a personality, am I not right about that, man?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Oh, come on, Zag, and here I thought that we were cool. You hurt my pride, there, man. I guess I'm going to have to hurt yours....",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Ohhh man, that was definitely not a thing to do, I mean, are we best mates, or not...? You think on that, while I do this.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Look Zag, I'm not going to lie, you hurt my feelings here, I thought we had a thing! A close familial bond! I'm really mad now that I think on it!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"What, you wouldn't hang with me given the choice? I thought I had you sorted, man, but maybe you just don't appreciate the finer things!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Ah, come on, Zag, now that was not the choice I would have made, you messing with me, man? All right! I'll mess with you.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Ohh, we all make mistakes from time to time, man, and you ought to know! You made one there just now!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Why do it to me like that, Zag, man, I thought we were close as grapes upon the vine, but I was wrong?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Did I do something to deserve this, man, because I thought that we were getting on just fine, better than fine, but this?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"It's not that I'm upset or anything, here, Zag, you know I'm not, but truthfully I am a bit annoyed, a little bit, and so, I got to send the message, man.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Really, man? After everything we've been through together, this is the gratitude I get?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Well, way to spoil the feast, there, Zag, I mean come on, I thought I was your mate? Was I mistaken, man?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Zag, I can take a jest, ask anybody, but when it comes to competition here, it's not a laughing matter! Do you understand me, man?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Sorry, Dionysus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sorry, Dionysus mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't take it personally, Dionysus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Still mates, right, Dionysus?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right, all right, all right, we're cool, we're cool, no need to get all hot and bothered any longer, here!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"OK, let's say we're settled up now, Zag, and go on being best mates just like before, yeah?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You know, Zag, you are not so bad, just had a little lapse in judgment, happens to me all the time, now let's get on with it!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, now, that was quite a sight, I got to hand it to you, man, and you deserve this, here!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Know what, man, I'm not even angry after that. What was I even going off about, do you recall...?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"OK, all right, it's fine already, Zag, you win this time and I am good as grapes.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Appreciate your understanding, there, man, so let's just avoid this type of little shake-up next time, yeah?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hahahahahah, OK, thanks for a good laugh, there, Zag, what was it I was going on about, before...?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Oh I just can't stay mad about you, Zag, and to be honest, why, I wasn't that mad to begin with, I just thought I'd shake your branches up a bit!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You're all right, man, you're all right, don't even worry about the rough patch we just crossed back there, we're stronger than all that!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I figured this time I'd stay mad at you for sure, man, but you know what, I just couldn't! No matter how hard I tried.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"It's like I always say, Zag, you have got to permit yourself a bad time every now and again to really appreciate all the good times, yeah?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Know what, man, just forget about what happened, yeah? 'Cause I already did, I mean, it happens, right?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Lord Dionysus, it's been great getting to know you, so, please accept this humble offering.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now that is something, a right princely gift, there, Zag, and just so happens I got something here I have been meaning to give you!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"A toast in your honor, Lord Dionysus mate. Have I mentioned how pleased I am to have made your acquaintance?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hoh-oh, what, is that for me, really, I mean, cheers man, that is awful generous of you, I'm much obliged!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Lord Dionysus mate, you have made the mood down here materially less miserable, and I am much obliged.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, is that for me, why Zag, I mean you really shouldn't have, you know I can't get enough of this stuff, right?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Lord Dionysus mate, you must have no shortage of supreme vintage at your disposal, but this one's from me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why Zag, how positively thoughtful, man, I mean I love it, positively love this stuff, and I am very moved that you would think of me for it!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hey, on no occasion whatsoever, cheers to you again, Lord Dionysus mate! This place is so much less dreary under your influence!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, this is the greatest, Zag! This feast I'm headed to? I was getting a little concerned I wasn't going to have quite enough to go around for everyone. Well, you just saved my evening, man! Too bad you couldn't be there, yeah?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Dionysus mate, sometimes things weigh heavily on me, but then I hear from you, and it's like I don't have a care in the world! To your health!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you're really too much for me sometimes, you know that, man? Got to tell you, I don't think I ever felt so close to somebody so damn far away. But through the gift of drink? It's like we're with each other in spirit, all the time, you know?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"What does one offer to the god of wine? The very best, is what, and down here, this is it, mate! I'm grateful I've got some of your spirit in me. To have such a connection, with you despite all the distance between us...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Zag, I cannot believe what you are offering to me! Ambrosia, man, for me? And talk about a bottle that has seen some wild days and nights, I mean if it got all the way to you down there, only to come back up! Know what? I'm saving it, till we can share it, here!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Thank you, Dionysus mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You want to tangle with us?!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Here, this one's on me!!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Drink up, mates!!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Positively man!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Oh absolutely!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Have I got just the thing for you!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Time for a real feast!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Something for everyone!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You got it, man!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Come on already man.,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
You serious right now?,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
You kidding me with this?,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
I can't believe this man.,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"An exciting offer, Dionysus mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"A fine exchange, Lord Dionysus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dionysus mate, I accept.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What can I say, man, it's a shame all right.",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
I'm absolutely gutted man.,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Now that's a crying shame.,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Didn't have to be like this, man! We were having such a good time!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Hate to sour the occasion like this, Zag. What was I supposed to do?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Eugh, I feel bad all of a sudden, man, I mean, what happened, there?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"Oh hey man, what is new?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Hey you hanging in there yeah?,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"You still in one piece, man?",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Hoh yeah I'm into it!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Here this one's for you!,CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
Lady Athena...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Goddess Athena...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Noble cousin, my lord father has taken keen interest in your journey and your plight, and now seeks to aid you with the thunder of heaven itself. And you've my support, as well, of course.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I thank you for the generous introduction, fair Athena, and I always rest assured when you are close at hand. I trust with our combined might, our good Zagreus is virtually certain to succeed!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"When I first notified Lord Father Zeus and other members of our family of your existence, Zagreus, it was Uncle Poseidon here who first leapt up, and pledged his power over sea and earth to you. Is that not so, Uncle?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Exactly so, Athena! You, with that fine memory of yours! For it isn't everyday I learn my doleful brother Hades sired a fine son! He does not know how good he has it, there! And you, Nephew, could have it even better, here!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, Cousin. Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Oh, if only I had wisdom such as yours, Athena dear, so that I was more capable of picking up on subtle jabs and insults such as that! You're not fooling anybody with your feigned benevolence, you know.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"The world is not all lies and deceit as you make it out to be, Aphrodite. Sometimes, a lending of assistance is no more than it appears to be. Now either back up Zagreus, or stand aside.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"If you've a moment, Zagreus? One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time. So I invited her to contact you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Um, hello, Zagreus... Athena here is grandstanding or trying to prove a point, or something. I don't know. Anyway, nice talking to you.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Well, I suppose that's settled, then. I am afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family; but what's a family without flaws?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Some members of our family do not yet fully understand just how precarious your situation is, Cousin. My Lord Dionysus here, he goes about as though this is a festive matter of some sort!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Oh, come on, Athena girl, you really mean to tell me that discovering a long-lost relative isn't a cause for celebrating right away, I mean, you can't be telling me a thing like that? Because if Zag isn't a cause for feasting, I don't know what is!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I bring to you the Lady Demeter, Cousin. I've asked that she please rest assured knowing we have your matter well under control. Though, in her infinite compassion, she has taken up your cause, nevertheless!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Oh, you needn't lavish me with your faint praise, Athena dear. In all your boundless intellect, I'd have expected you would know I see through your intentions, plain as day.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The biting cold surrounding you must mean the Goddess of Seasons decided to take an interest in your struggle, Zagreus? I did not count on Demeter being a part of this. Take heart, though use discretion around her.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"This is it, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Athena, I trust you'll quickly figure this one out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Is this some kind of offering for me? No, hold a moment, this appears to be a message! Part of one. Then, can this mean...? I have to notify the others. I trust they also have received something from you, or shortly shall.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It was my privilege to have visited your father's House, and briefly had a chance to meet you, Zagreus. Nyx and your mother each are very shrewd; perhaps you've taken after both of them. As for your new responsibilities... exposing weak points in defenses is my specialty.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I understand you've been in contact with my father. Your uncle Zeus, I mean. He's taken interest in your plight; you should feel honored!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You've met the master of the seas, Poseidon, haven't you? Our uncle's affable but quick to anger. Be on your guard with him, is my advice.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Cousin, you've met Aphrodite, no? She likes beguiling others with her charms; but her intentions with you I believe are pure. You'll find our strengths are complementary.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"My warlike brother Ares reached you, didn't he. I've always found his conduct quite disturbing. At least it seems he's helping you for now.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'll tell you something, Cousin: If even Artemis is aiding you, it's proof your cause is just. She doesn't often take an interest in family affairs.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Did Dionysus truly visit you before? He tends to seek out revelry, not conflict. I'm pleased to know he's making himself useful here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You arrived sooner than anticipated, Cousin, and my estimations seldom are inaccurate. All for the best, of course. Perhaps you're simply faster than I thought.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Zagreus, perhaps it is a fancy of imagination, but it seems almost as though, this time, you bear the blessing of... your own father! If Lord Hades is assisting you in any way in this, then I shall hold out hope that your relationship yet has capacity to heal, to some extent at least.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"So you've another blessing from Lord Hades, then. Zagreus, I'm under no delusion you and your father shall become the closest friends, from here. Neverthless, I do believe it's possible to move forward even such a relationship as yours. Believe me... I know.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I so look forward to our meeting face to face amongst the gods, dear Cousin. Olympus shall be merrier and wiser once you're here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Hail and good tidings to you, noble Cousin. May you be swift and thorough vanquishing the dead who dare oppose you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Remain relentless in your effort to escape, dear Cousin. In spite of all our differences, perseverance is a quality we all possess.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You can always count upon assistance from me, Zagreus. I always shall prioritize the needs of our family above everything else.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Let my voice be a glimmer in the darkness, noble Cousin; though, may the blessing I am about to provide be even more than that.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You've met your distant relatives by now. We don't all share the same demeanor, nor see eye to eye. Though, all of us, I think, wish you the best.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The one called Nyx... she is your mother, as I understand? We Olympians rarely consort with the chthonic gods. Though Nyx herself reached out to me about your plight, and I was spurred to act.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
Please send the goddess Nyx my kind regards. That she supports you in your effort to escape her own domain suggests a selflessness I would not have expected.,CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It's such a cruelty that your father hid the knowledge of your birth and life from us, my cousin. It's unacceptable.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Your father Hades and my father Zeus have not communicated in some time, and Zeus refuses to explain. Something transpired between the two of them. Perhaps you know better than I.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"There's something that I've wished to tell you, Zagreus: There is no shame in your upbringing. Many of us on Olympus, we likewise were born and raised under the strangest circumstances. Someday I'll have to tell you about mine.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You're nothing like your father, Zagreus. I mean that as a compliment. He cut himself off from the rest of us. Many times have we attempted peace, to no avail.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It comforts me to see how far you've come, Cousin. And I am confident that you shall make your way, eventually. I shall look forward to our conversations then.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You reached the flames of Asphodel, well done! You may have quite a distance still to go, but having crossed through Tartarus is no small step, Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I see you've made it all the way to hallowed Elysium, Cousin? A significant way toward the surface, and if you could get there the one time, surely you have what it takes to do it again, and overcome the dangers that await therein.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I understand you nearly reached the surface lately, Zagreus. My confidence remains unshaken that you shall get out of there, eventually. No matter what sorts of unknown horrors lie shrouded beyond the boundary there.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Were you not close to having reached the surface lately, Cousin? Then, this can only mean some unforeseen impediment prevented your escape.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"There must be some unconquerable force or foe awaiting you, just at the border of your realm and ours. We cannot even see it through a shroud of darkness, there. I shall make certain that your family knows it may take considerable time to surpass... so fear not, for we are patient, here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Despite whatever difficulties you've encountered, dear Cousin, again and again, you have never yielded. I must admit, your strength of will is quite inspiring. For, even I have doubts, from time to time. It's all the clearer to me why the goddess Nyx spoke so highly of you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It's fortunate your troubles with your mother were resolved. Persephone, I mean! To think I led all of my family to believe your mother was the goddess Nyx, instead. It seems I was an unwitting accomplice to a bit of a deception, there. But Nyx, I know she merely tried to help.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You bear my Owl Pendant, noble Cousin! Wherever it should go, I faintly see its shimmer from afar. Even where you reside! For owls see in total darkness, after all.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I have grown closer than expected with the goddess Nyx in all of this, Cousin. It is quite evident to me how much she cares for you. I must admit I envy your relationship, sometimes. For I've made do without a mother's presence in my life.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Lord Ares has suggested he and goddess Nyx have grown much closer to each other, in all this. Nothing untoward, if you must know. Ares and I have often disagreed, about so many things, and yet we share a fondness for the Night herself, it seems.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Sometimes I think about the goddess Nyx, and how I long for her to be the mother that I never had, Cousin. Is it improper that I say such things to you? One would expect I would already have somebody on Olympus, yet... it often feels as though I am the mother, here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The goddess Nyx has indicated you possess a list of prophecies from the Three Fates. I've such a list upon Olympus, here! It seems to be connected to your own, as several prophecies already are fulfilled. Isn't it such an honor to urge Fate along?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You cannot withstand your father's legions, Zagreus. But if you possess one of my greatest blessings, things may unfold differently, I think.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Dear Cousin, would that I could give to you everlasting, tireless resolve. Though, come to think of it, this may be suited as a counterpart.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Supporting you through your ordeal, Cousin? It's reminiscent of the thrill of doing battle by the side of those whom I hold dear. I may be safe upon our mountaintop, though I am with you there, as well... for every well-earned victory, and bitter loss.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You brandish the Eternal Spear we call Varatha...! So then it wasn't lost during the war. A magnificent weapon, in deserving hands.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Why, you wield Coronacht the Heart-Seeker...! I never took you for an archer, though the power of that bow is undeniable. Use it wisely!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You bear Aegis, the original itself...! My own shield was forged much later, in its image. You'll have to tell me someday how you found it.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You got your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists, I see. No ordinary weapon. Prone to fits of savagery quite unbecoming of a well-trained warrior. Then watch yourself, and throw not caution to the wind.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The Rail of Adamant, itself, has found its way into your hands, Cousin? A malignant thing, if you were to ask me, and not one I would ever use, myself. Unless, perhaps, I had no other choice. I suppose it must have been that way for you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You're badly injured aren't you, Cousin? I wish that I could will the pain away, though at the least I can provide you this.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Look at you, Zagreus, you're barely fit to fight from all the injury that you've sustained! I'll try to keep you going for as long as possible.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It seems to me that you've sustained life-draining injuries already, Zagreus. But don't lose hope. We can sustain you in a proper fighting shape.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You may have suffered many wounds but shall not perish imminently, Cousin. Not if I have anything to say about it. Here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Oh, Zagreus... your recent battles evidently haven't gone as hoped. Nevertheless, always strive onward, while you still draw breath.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"For you, my cousin Zagreus, I wish to offer the most potent of the blessings I am able to bestow. Make wise your use of this, and rise toward us!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The circumstances spur me now to offer you the greatest of my powers, Cousin. Take my strength, and strike the darkness down!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It's got to be her. Then, here goes nothing... Ahem. In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hail, noble Cousin. Now, let's get you from that miserable place. I'll see that all of us upon Olympus do our part, beginning here with me.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Keep fighting, Cousin. Fight from out of that eternal gloom. I trust that you'll be joining us upon Olympus shortly.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I have your back, Cousin. Rise now to your rightful station with my blessings!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"May the light and fury of Olympus guide you from the dark, Cousin. I've a token of it for you here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Push forward, noble Cousin. I shall be keen to see you circumvent the perils that the Fates arranged for you this time.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Vanquish all who stand against you, noble Cousin. I and your relatives upon Olympus shall assist you in so doing.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Sometimes I think about what you've endured, to have been living in that loathsome squalor, Cousin. I swear, you'll have your justice.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Do not fear your father's cruel legions, Cousin! Their lives are long since forfeit, and they cannot stand against one of your birthright, nor against my power.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Yours is a brazen plan of action, Zagreus, and I admire it. The boldest strategy often prevails. Especially with my support.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Take heart, Cousin; for you have found me even in the suffocating darkness of the Underworld. May my power be of some assistance.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Your struggles have not gone unnoticed, Cousin, so take heart. Eternity awaits you once you finally break free.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Here on Olympus is the opposite of everything about that lifeless squalor you reside in, Zagreus. Fight on and come to us!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Cousin, I grow angry merely thinking of your situation. May what power I can offer be of service as you struggle towards your fate.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Your father chose to sever ties with all of us, and stew alone within his land beneath the earth. But you are not beholden to his actions. Fight!",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Your labors make you stronger, noble Cousin. And, the blessings I now offer ought to make you stronger still.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I've found you once again, dear Cousin, and my strength is yours; so much of it as I can send there to the bowels of the earth.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'm here again to lend to you my power, noble Cousin. Though your own strength of will is how you'll finally break free of that cruel place.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'm pleased to see your father's stubbornness is manifest in you as such determination, Zagreus. My blessing be with you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"What wretched fools dare stand against you, Cousin? Punish them, so that they learn something they ought have learned in life.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Hold fast to your resolve, Cousin, and climb on toward the surface. No matter how often your foothold falters, I am here.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I shall not keep you, Zagreus, except to offer you some of my power to improve your chances of escape. Now quickly choose, and go.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"May wisdom and good fortune guide you toward the light of day this time, Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The Underworld's wretched dead shall fear you yet, Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Strength and wisdom guide you from the darkness, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
The low cunning of your lifeless enemies is not a match for your divine might.,CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Remember I am always watching over you, dear Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You'll have your justice in due course, Cousin. I promise you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The might and fury of Olympus courses through you, noble Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I take it you've a plan in mind this time for how you're going to escape, don't you, Cousin?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I shall not keep you, Zagreus, except to offer you my power to improve your chances of escape.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Remain relentless in your effort, Zagreus. For perseverance is a quality we all possess.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I and your family on Olympus all stand ready to support you in your efforts, noble Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Remember, doubt and hesitancy are your real enemies, Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I know that you are more than capable even without my power, Cousin. But just in case...",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Envision your success, and choose the means by which you shall achieve it, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I shall not offer empty words, dear Cousin; I shall instead offer you this.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"With our ferocity combined, Cousin, what chances do your father's forces even have?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"My support alone is not enough to see you through this, Zagreus; but it certainly shall help.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Your foes shall soon find it impossible to overcome your strength, combined with mine.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
I've every confidence that you shall imminently put my blessing to good use.,CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Let not your sense of purpose waver, Zagreus. Visualize the outcome you desire.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Make not the same mistake twice, and you shall always grow wiser, no matter what else.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I shall do everything within my power to defend you from the perils of your journey, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Take heed against your father's legions, Zagreus. And take also my power.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Do not forget that changing strategy can be the key to victory, Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I cannot glean the details of your predicament right now, Cousin. Though maybe this shall help.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The might and honor of Olympus shield you against the darkness and the dead, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I take it having an impenetrable defense against your enemies may be of some use, Cousin?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'm not in any mood to trifle with your father's nonsense this time, Zagreus. So, use this.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"These are among the mightest defenses I can offer, Zagreus. Choose wisely, then.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I've readied several of my most potent blessings so your victory can be achieved, Cousin.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Observe, dear Cousin, for this time I offer you uncommonly superior protection.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"It feels unseemly to make contact from that most-unpleasant boatman's stash of ill-gotten wares. Nonetheless, this was an opportunity.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You're difficult to track there in the depths, Cousin; though, the boatman Charon thankfully is proving of some help.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"The river-boatman Charon is beholden to your father's realm, but seems agreeable enough, for a fair price.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"A shrewd expenditure of wealth is sometimes all that stands between a victory and sore defeat, isn't that right, Cousin?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"We cannot effectively communicate with Charon from Olympus, but he is amenable to certain trades, and seems unfettered by your father's influence.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I thought we were on better terms, Cousin. I ask only for your cooperation, yet still you turn your back...?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'm disappointed you would spurn me like this, Cousin. Know that I retaliate not out of spite, but by necessity.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You'd choose one of my relatives, instead of me...? Though I myself was first to contact you? Alas, I must respond to you in kind.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Upon Olympus, I'm your closest confidant. You'd best remember this before you spurn me again.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"We Olympians, we are a prideful family, Cousin. You cannot simply choose a favorite without spurring one of us to wrath.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I understand you've made your choice, Cousin. And I, in turn, now have my family's reputation to uphold.",CHARACTER,Athena,female

"No one in our family can avoid taking sides forever, Zagreus. But you can take the more sensible side, at least.",CHARACTER,Athena,female

"You could have avoided this outcome any number of ways, yet still you risk incurring my wrath.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Are you testing the limits of my patience with you, Zagreus? Then, I shall test your limits, in turn.",CHARACTER,Athena,female

"Now then! I hope we can move past this little incident, and keep our focus on the task at hand.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'm satisfied we understand each other better, now, don't we. What do you say we carry on, and get you from this place?",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"All is forgiven, Zagreus, and I take no offense. Exacting vengeance is just something we Olympians all do from time to time.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'd say I've bickered with you quite enough for now, Cousin. Let us continue down a more productive path.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"We've better things to do, I think, than fight amongst ourselves over a matter such as this.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I would very much prefer to think we both know better than to let old grudges stew forever, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"You see I have my father's temper, Zagreus. I am able to keep it in check, though I expect you to do your part.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Conflict between the members of our family is inevitable, Zagreus. All we can do is learn and grow from it.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I see no benefit to staying angry, Cousin. I promised Nyx that I would help rather than hinder you.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Your father also made some questionable choices, Zagreus. But all of us are family, after all.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"I'm indebted to you, Goddess, for all that you and your side of the family have done for me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

What's Uncle Poseidon doing here?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Uncle Poseidon...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Lord Poseidon...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hoh, what's this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What is this...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Now, little Hades, you have met my brother Zeus! He's sometimes known as king of all the gods! Although, in many ways, he's not as powerful as I! Nor anywhere as dashing. Why, I, oop!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Now, Brother... you know better than to say such things about me, I should think. I know that tact does not come easily to you, though I'd be careful what you say to our good nephew, there.",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Buh, erm, anyway, as I was saying, little Hades! Brother Zeus is king of all the gods! And the most dashing, powerful, and hey, let's face it, godliest of all!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"As you can see by now, we are a big and clever family, little Hades! My niece Athena here being the cleverest of all. You'd never know that she was childless, the way she looks after and cares for all of us!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Surely my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, Lord Uncle Poseidon. And I would only add, my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family, thus no further need for more of them, for now.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Now, little Hades, you must know by now I've other nephews here, don't you? For instance, Ares comes to mind, the god of war! Some mighty wars have taken place at sea, is that not so?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Indeed, they have, good Uncle Poseidon. Mortals show great ingenuity when war is concerned; it drives their sense of progress, more than anything at all. Perhaps someday they shall wage war even in Father's skies.",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"The thing about me, Nephew, is I get along with everybody, here! A skill apparently that's rather rare! Take my niece Artemis, for instance! Can't ever take a simple jest, at all! You won't easily attract a mate with such a sour look about you, girl!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh, and wouldn't that be such a pity, Uncle Poseidon. I wonder what could be the cause of this sour look that I perpetually have up here? Maybe Zagreus knows.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"Hahaha! See exactly what I mean, Nephew?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My foster-sister Goddess Demeter, despite her stern approach, she often likes to make good sport of me, Nephew! Why, here she is right now!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"If you're quite finished blathering, Poseidon, our young Zagreus has more important things to do. He needs your blessings, not your point of view. Don't you, young sprout?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Ah-haha! I knew that I could count on you, Nephew! So the ungrateful Theseus, the winsome prize he earned was just some chariot, correct? And he was vanquished on it, anyway! That's what he gets! Boasting his prize was greater than any in his mortal days, pah!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah-haha-hah, little Hades, I was certain you'd the wherewithal to thin the ranks of the betraying river denizens who fled my surface-seas to your father's domain!! I bid you good fish-hunting forevermore!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"All right, here goes. In the name of Hades! Olympus! This is an official message! Uncle Poseidon, hope you can make this out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's this, Nephew? Why, isn't this a note? Or, part of one, addressed to me, but it appears there should be other pieces, for the others here? Ah, it's like a sunken treasure, then! Which means I must seek its mysteries at once!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You know, Nephew, I had a positively raucous time down there, with your old father, and Persephone, was she a sight! I never thought I'd see her again! So then, we're one big happy family, at last! But you've a job to do, and we upon Olympus, we'll do our fair share!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"So, Nephew, my honored brother Zeus already has endowed you with his thunderous might? Well you shall soon forget about all that, after a taste of this!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahh, you've received a blessing from Athena there already, little Hades! So careful all the time, that one, but here, I'll help you live a little, just in case!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh-hoh, so you've already heard from Aphrodite, have you, Nephew? Understandable, but first things first, now let me add a little something to all that!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hoy, Nephew! It's my understanding you've been blessed already by one of my other nephews, Ares! As you can see, not all of us are cut from the same cloth; and thank the Fates for that!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I sense that you've been marked by the elusive Artemis, correct, Nephew? She shies away from most of us, so if she's taken somewhat of a liking to you, great!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Whenever Dionysus calls a feast, I'm turning up sooner or later, hear me, Nephew? So make room for one more blessing, and, let's go!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Little Hades, it appears that you are moving right along! Almost at an uncanny pace!! I wonder how you got to be so fast! Aquatic exercise?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Nephew, how is it you're navigating your cruel father's realm at such a blinding speed?! There's only one Olympian who moves that quick! Besides myself! Where is he, anyway?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Why, little Hades, there's a certain chill about you, meaning you received an ice-cold blessing courtesy of Elder Goddess Demeter, correct? Now, personally, I think water's best in liquid form, but who am I to judge?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You've come to know your Uncle Zeus, by now, correct? Just want to let you know, good Zeus gets very busy on the regular, so you just stick with me, I've always time for you, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Nephew, your cruel father, Hades, he's my elder brother, you know that? Not exactly the expressive type, and never was. We seldomly saw eye-to-eye on things!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I daresay, little Hades, you've some spunk in you! Why, I think you take after me more than my crusty elder brother! You'll get away from that old codger yet!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My crusty elder brother Hades must have tried to poison you against us lot! I can imagine it as clear as water, Nephew! I'm proud that you've resisted his undoubtedly most-twisted words!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Last time your father and I spoke, he told me I was all washed up, can you believe the nerve of it, Nephew? Why, he took the words right out of my mouth!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"It's likely, little Hades, that you currently reside just underneath one of my boundless seas! Normally you'd have to be submerged to use this power, but you know what, close enough!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You know I've many vitally important things to do besides lending my aid to you repeatedly, Nephew? But, all of that can wait! Family comes first!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"If you should ever make it here, Nephew, know this! I shall be pleased to stand in for the father figure I can tell you never really had. We can engage in all sorts of aquatic competitions, solve riddles, visit the sea-nymphs! Oh, it would be great, wouldn't you think?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Nephew, why, the seas up here, they're just about as widely feared as your vast Underworld down there! For water can be deadlier than bronze!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My oceans, they are filled with danger, not just water, little Hades! Many of the dead you face, they met their mortal end at sea, and not on land!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahh, it seems to me you've had yourself a spot of lady trouble, lately, isn't that correct, Nephew? I mean the Fury down in Tartarus, of course! You going to let her keep on bossing you around?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hah! I heard you showed that good-for-nothing Fury after all, I knew you'd handle that old crone, Nephew! And if she troubles you again, you just remind her who's in charge down there!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Good tidings, Nephew! I've learned that you have managed to get all the way to Asphodel, fine work! Now, you just keep on going!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ohh, Nephew, you've stood against the Bull of Minos, have you? Well I must apologize for any inconvenience there, because, he was a living testament to my revenge! Long story, boring really, rather sordid, too. Stay strong!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Word reaches us that you've come very far, indeed, Nephew! Striking distance from the surface! You just keep at it like that, and with our help, we'll have you out of there for sure!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I wonder what monstrosities await you near the surface, little Hades? There's your father's terrifying hell-hound, for one thing! Ah, well, I'm sure you'll find a way to sail past whatever's in your way!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Now don't lose heart, Nephew! Because in spite of all your efforts, it is probably the case that you still have a long and painful road ahead!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah, I thought for certain you were well on your way out of there last time, Nephew! But, no matter, we'll just get you on another voyage to the top!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Little Nephew, why, I could have sworn you made it to the surface recently, and yet, you're all the way back there, again? Must be some sort of terrible monstrosity preventing your way out!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I'll tell you, Nephew, I was quite taken aback to learn Persephone, she was your mother all along! Just disappeared up here, one day! Ran off, I figured, as she's got some mortal blood in her. But she was with your father! That rascal is my brother, after all!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"So how is crusty old Hades faring down there of late, Nephew? Fewer worries there upon his brow? That Underworld of yours all running smoothly, and all that? We'll keep on pitching in from over here. Least we can do!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Persephone, she says you're really stuck down there, born of the Underworld, something like that? Well, if you ask me, that's no kind of attitude to have! You can do anything you set your mind to, Nephew! Take it from me!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"If you do ever get the opportunity to spend some time up here, Nephew, know I shall take you on a grand tour of the surface! From the depths of my seas to the height of Olympus! Sure, maybe not today, or tomorrow, or even the next aeon! But sometime, we should go!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Been nice to see my brothers getting on again, just like old times! Well, not exactly like old times, and come to think of it, there always was a bit of tension there between those two, but still! It's better than before!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Your good mother Persephone, she's here all safe and sound, thought you should know, there, little Hades! Shame you can't be here with her, too, but ah! Doubtless we'll someday meet again!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah-hah! I sense you have in your possession that fine shell I sent to you, a little gift plucked straight out of the sea! You keep it close so I can better track you down!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My, my, little Hades, you brandish Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! That weapon's power was so terrifying that we sealed it away. Oh well! Surely its mortal-damning secrets shall be safely guarded in your hands!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Huh! Why, if my eyes do not deceive me through those murky depths, you brandish Malphon! Let me tell you, little Hades, those old gloves have done some dirty work before your time!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Why, little Hades, it is awful murky where you are, but if I'm not mistaken, and I never am, you wield fearsome Stygius! She once belonged to me, you know! Not quite my type, but we sure had our times! You take good care of her for me!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Say, is it me, or do you bear your father's ancient spear, Nephew? I always wanted one a bit like that. And now I have one even better. Hah!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"This time, Nephew, let's really show your father what you're made of: Water! For the most part! Mortals, at least, are mostly made of it. Bet you did not know that!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"The mortals like to give me thanks for all my generosity, Nephew! But little do they know, I have been saving up a bunch of it for you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Say, word has reached me that you squared against one known as Theseus, now champion there in Elysium? He was a handful even when he lived! So much so that my honored brother Zeus, he took to calling him my son, can you believe the nerve?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"So, little Hades, doubtless you have seen that we upon Olympus also lend our favor to the mighty Theseus, who bars your passage from Elysium! Now, don't you take it personally, there, because our blessings go to all who deserve them. Although, we try to save the best for you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"That scoundrel Theseus! Apparently he earned himself some sort of winsome prize, for all his blustering there in Elysium! Though, I'm quite certain that, no matter what he and his bull friend have at their disposal, you've the power to defeat them, utterly! So go do it, surely I'll get word!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Why, Nephew, you've procured the Rod of Fishing, I detect! Fine handiwork if I say so myself! Its line is nigh-invisible and causes denizens of my domain to flock to it like mortals to temples of mine! Good fortune with that thing!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I'm told a number of the underwater denizens from my domain were captured fair-and-square through your surpassing skill using the Rod of Fishing, little Hades!! They're yours, I've millions more!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"All these river denizens you've caught, little Hades... it can only mean we share a deep connection, don't you think? I, with my power over the entire vastness of the seas! And you, with the power to ensnare a hapless fish with but a flick of the wrist!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Say, what exactly is that very mighty-looking spear I think I faintly see in your possession there, it's... why, I've not seen a thing like that except on very distant shores! It's almost as impressive as my trident here! Almost, I say!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You bear some sort of splendid-looking weapon, there, Nephew! Must be another aspect of fair Stygius, my old discarded blade! Never did see that one myself, but, I saw many others that were splendid, too!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hoh, you look positively in atrocious shape, there, Nephew! What's the matter, one too many run-ins with the wretched dead before I intervened?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Seems to me that you're in dire straits, there, little Hades! Why, you're bleeding everywhere! Here, let me try and do something for that.",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah, what happened to you, little Hades?! I can tell even from here that you've been beaten like a skiff during a storm!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Now, don't go dying on me, yet, Nephew! You have to live! Or else the Boon I offer you shall go to waste!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Your hated enemies, they almost got the best of you, I fear! But you can still turn it around, especially now that you have my aid!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ohh, have I got something for you this time, little Hades! Something special I have saved for when you really proved yourself!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"There's nothing stronger than the sea, Nephew, neither above it nor below!! And, if you are in need of further proof, behold: The greatest of my blessings, just for you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"It's uncle number two, it's got to be. Then, in the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hoy there, little Hades! You recognize your uncle, do you not? We've a lot of catching up to do, but first things first, you get yourself out of that dour Underworld! As for me, I'll see if I can stir things up a bit to cover your advance!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hoy, Nephew, it's excellent to see you once again, and in good spirits, still? Then, come, let's make some waves!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahoy, little Hades, it is I! The greatest of your uncles! Here to aid you in your daringest escape attempt! And I do admire your persistence!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Good tidings once again, there, little Nephew!! It is I, returned as ever here to make a splash against your many, many foolish enemies!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahoy, Nephew! I bet you have your hands full dealing with your enemies down there, so let me see what I can do. And I can do a lot!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"It seems you're getting somewhere, little Nephew! Good, but here, allow your favorite Uncle to bestow a little boost!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah, hahaha! Found you down there, Nephew! Now let's overwhelm your enemies in a typhoon of godly might, what do you say?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Little Hades, have I ever told you I detest the dead? Well, I admit it, I just cannot stand a mortal past his due. So how about we get you far away from all such filth, agreed?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"What do you say, there, Nephew, ready to get wet, or no? Oh I suspect you are, so let's get to it, and dispense some liquid justice!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"How fares your feud against my crusty elder brother lately, good? Big Hades, he is disagreeable with all of us, not just with you, so, don't you take it personal, and stick with me!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Looks like you could use the power of the sea, wouldn't you say so, little Hades? Good thing I'm here, so that together, we might wash your enemies away!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Enough kidding around without me, Nephew! I am here, so let's go bust you out, much like a raging river through a frail little dam!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You're looking somewhat stronger than before, there, little Nephew, but you're much too scrawny still, to be quite blunt. So, here! Let's fatten you right up!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hoy, my nephew! I think I have kept you waiting long enough, so then, let's go! And break our enemies to pieces, like so many ships upon the shoals!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I'll have you know, the power of the seas themselves is yours once more, Nephew! So how about you put it to its rightful purpose, and go smash some stuff!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Are you perchance in need of godlike aid, Nephew? Well, excellent! Because I happen to command the sea, and I shall hereby let you take it for a whirl!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Who dares to mess with little Hades? You simply point me at them, Nephew, and we'll leave them shivering and sopping wet, you'll see!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"At last I found you once again, Nephew! You eating well and getting strong, correct? I'll help you with the latter category in a moment. Here!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"The awesome bounty of the sea is yours to do with as you please, Nephew! I've mustered forth a sample, anyway!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hoh, little Hades! I'd heard you were preparing to rain terrible destruction on your enemies! So I got here as quickly as I could! I'm not too late, am I?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"All of us must sail through troubled waters now and then, correct, Nephew? Fortunately, navigation is my speciality, so let's be on our way!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Your victory's most certainly at hand now that I'm here, Nephew! So long as you make sure to take advantage of the absolutely awesome power I bequeath!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Why, if it isn't the most favored of my nephews, stuck as ever though you may yet be! We'll get you from there, little Hades, don't despair, Uncle Poseidon's here!!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Good tidings, my most favored nephew! All is relatively well, I hope? But hope alone is worthless without action, is it not? So here, let's act together!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Just wait until you see the seas, Nephew! My underwater realm is the most glorious of the world's habitats. It positively teems with life, and it's much cooler there than in that sweaty Underworld of yours!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Well, Nephew, supposing it's high time for the high seas to lend their might once more?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Your uncle's offering to shake things up once more, what say you, little Hades?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"No more dallying about, now, little Nephew! Time instead we really got somewhere!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Good tidings, little Hades! It is I! And I am always here to help!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Fear not, Nephew, it is I, your uncle! Come to wash away your troubles, here and now!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Just point me toward your enemies, Nephew, and they'll become sworn enemies of mine!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Let's get you out from underneath the sea, there, little Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahoy, my godly Nephew, I've arrived, so set aside your worries and let's drench the dead!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"How about we set you up here with some real water-power, little Hades?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I take it you could use some liquid courage at this time, no, little Hades?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"How about a swim, there, little Hades? A swim, that is, within the Pool of Blessings! Now, dive in!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I'm here, Nephew, to aid you in your time of need, with this!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I heard that you could use the awesome power of the sea, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Go on and make a splash for me, why don't you, little Hades!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"The treasures of the sea are limitless, so here! You take your pick!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"What do you say we make some waves, right, little Hades?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Don't let the wretched dead dampen your spirits, little Hades! Dampen theirs!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Here comes another cool, refreshing blessing for you, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Water can even cut through solid stone, with enough time! So you keep at it, there!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I know that you can do it, little Hades! Whatever it may be!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"It's darker than the bottom of the sea in there! Are you alive, Nephew?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"The secrets of the sea can all be yours! Eventually at least, I have just three for now!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You still alive down there, Nephew? Because if so, why, this ought to keep it that way!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Must get so stuffy in that dreary place, Nephew! So why don't you cool off a bit, with this!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You have a dirty job down there, Nephew, but I can help you to clean up a bit!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"All that I ask, here, little Nephew, is for you to do your best! As I would do!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahoy, and now prepare yourself! For I've a rare treat here, especially for you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I am ever impressed with your will to succeed, Nephew, so here! Great blessings be with you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You've earned only the very finest of my blessings, little Hades! Why? Why not!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"If you are ever going to get out of there, only the mightiest of all my blessings will suffice!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My favorite Nephew ought have access to my greatest blessings, should he not?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah-hah! You found me, little Nephew! Strewn among the inventories of that most disturbing river-boatman! That means you win my blessing!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Well, well, my plan to get ahold of you via the boatman worked out flawlessly! Harness the might of the sea, then, why don't you?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Well, Nephew, I know that salty Charon can be difficult. But I am certain that whatever price you paid, you got a deal!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Nothing comes freely for the mortals on the surface, Nephew! And from the sound of things, it isn't any different with that Charon character!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Let me just say, Nephew, that money-hoarding boatman best be fair with you! Because I'd hate to see anything happen to that little boat of his!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Whaaaa, you think that you've a chance in hell without my help, am I to understand?! You made a big mistake there, little Hades, just you watch.",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"How bold of you to throw your lot in with my relatives instead of me, given the choice, there, little Hades. But don't you ever bet against this horse!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh, now, it seems to me your strength outweighs your smarts, there, Nephew, if you're prone to picking other sides than mine!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"A word of caution, little Nephew: Never turn your back against the sea. And, while you're at it, never take up sides against your greatest uncle!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Augh! I'm absolutely flabbergasted, Nephew!! I offer you the finest blessings of the earth and sea, and they're not good enough?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Apparently my crusty elder brother failed to teach you any manners, if you deign to thusly spurn my offerings! But I can teach you yet!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Betrayal, little Hades!! Of all my nephews, you should know better than this! Or perhaps I should. One of us, at least!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"That's definitely not the choice I would have made, Nephew! Because, for me to side against myself, why, that would make no sense at all!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Nephew, what you have just done is tantamount to spitting in my face! Let me remind you, then, the ocean can spit back!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You wound me, little Hades, with your callous choice! It's fortunate I'm quite impervious to harm. But I don't think the same is true for you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You know the saying not to play with fire, don't you, Nephew? You'll find the same is very much the case with water, too!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Again, you would defy me, little Hades? I'm beginning to see why your father might be very frustrated, indeed, having to deal with you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"It seems that you require yet one more gentle reminder not to scoff at chances to accept my blessings, little Hades! Now remember this!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Sometimes I think, surely my nephew takes to heart my strongly worded threats about my distaste for his little acts of treachery, but no!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I could have sworn I told you never to take the power of the sea for granted, little Hades? It seems the time for words is over, then!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I'm sorry, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sorry, Uncle Poseidon.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't be mad, Uncle?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Poseidon won't like this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, very well then, little Hades! Uncle's going to let you off the hook this time. Just mind your manners next we meet!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I must hand it to you, little Hades! I did not expect that you would weather such a storm! I'm mightily impressed!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah, I can't stay angry! Let us call all that unpleasantness back there water under the bridge, what say you, Nephew?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My, a show of strength like that deserves a commendation I should think! Although, for next time, know my favor's not a thing to trifle with!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"All right, that's quite enough, I take it you have had about enough of that, correct? You're pretty good! So here, why don't you run along!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh, hoh-hoh, you've got some fire in you, don't you, little Hades? Here! I've just the thing to cool you down, fresh from my own domain!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ah-haha, my fits of anger come and go just like the tides, Nephew! Now take this from me, and get out of here!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Now that was truly finely fought, indeed, Nephew! And I've a suitable reward here, just for you! Don't even know what I was mad about!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"What can I say, Nephew? Sometimes our tempers get the best of all of us. You're fortunate mine didn't get the best of you back there!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You weathered the storm, there, little Hades, and the sea is once again at peace. And you'll make every attempt to keep it that way, correct?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"All right, no need to fight about this any longer, don't you think, Nephew? Here, take my blessing, like you should have in the first place!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Now let's not set a bad example for the family, Nephew! We're better than all that. Besides! They've many bad examples as it is.",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you, sir, so, please, this is for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I am positively moved by your affection, little Nephew! Though, I think I have just the thing for you, in turn! Here, I shall transfer it to you!!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Uncle Poseidon, this here is for you. Would that my father were as easygoing as yourself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Ah-hah! A show of generosity from my most favored nephew! Your gift is mightily appreciated!! I'll just go ahead and add it to the pile.,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Mighty Poseidon, greatest of my uncles, arguably, please accept this gift!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"For all the times I'm offered gifts or sacrifices, little Nephew, I still always very much appreciate it! I mean, look! I'm grinning ear to ear!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Uncle Poseidon, I have a special catch for you! Although it pales next to your sheer awesomeness.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whaaa, now would you look at that! Is that an offering to your most favored uncle, me? You know what, Nephew? I've decided I shall take it! Thanks!!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I salute you, Uncle Poseidon! Your strength and confidence inspire me, and you accepted me as part of the family without question. It means a lot.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, Nephew, but you needn't shower me with offerings and praise, you know! Why, I've no need of showering at all! Not when I've the sea itself, to do with as I please!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Whenever I encounter you, Uncle Poseidon, my spirits lift, and I feel there must not be anything that can stop me. I only wish we met sooner, though I'm grateful to have met you at all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I thought I told you, Nephew, not to make such offerings to me? Ah, probably forgot! Or getting you mixed up, perhaps, for I have many other nephews, thanks to Zeus! Though, between us, I don't like any one of them as much as you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Uncle Poseidon, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like had you been a part of it sooner. Your encouragement, your enthusiasm... it means a lot. To you! This Ambrosia's been to hell and back!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hohhh, but isn't this a kingly offering, indeed, my little Hades! I know how difficult it must have been to get, so distant from Olympus as you are! I'll never understand how come your father's cruel to you, for if you were my son, I would be proud! Proud anyway, but you get the idea.",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I thank you, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who dares attack my nephew?!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You can do this, little Hades!!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Engulf them, Nephew!!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You got it, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Of course, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
No problem whatsoever!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
It's time to make a splash!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Harness the ocean's might!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Now ride the wave, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Here comes some real water-power!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"My tolerance has limits, little Hades.",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Why, you tiny little gnat...!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
You're acting like a fool!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Who do you think you are!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
You cannot treat your uncle like THIS!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You call for my aid, now?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Have you no shame, Nephew?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Oh, now you want my help?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"A mighty offer, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You drive a hard bargain, Uncle.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Uncle Poseidon, I accept.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, haha, how embarrassing!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"I warn you not to trifle with me, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Oh you shouldn't have done that.,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Next time, Nephew, best not be such a fool!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"You disrespect the sea, and it is liable to swallow you!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Do not forget yourself with me next time, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Good tidings, Nephew!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Smooth sailing, little Hades?",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Ahoy, my nephew, it is I!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Think you're going to like this!,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Whaaat?,CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
Lady Demeter...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The Goddess Demeter...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's Demeter...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's Lady Demeter...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Grandmother Demeter...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My Grandmother...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wait... Persephone... Mother... is Demeter's daughter?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Winter... that's when it's cold, or something, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wait... Persephone... Mother... is Demeter's daughter?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, now, young sprout, you've met the so-called King of the Olympians, and I. Whom do you now suppose is genuinely ruler of this snow-encrusted mountaintop of ours?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Oh, hah-hah-hah, Lady Demeter! Your wit is just as dry as the earth lying quite fallow in your care! Perhaps you should go tend to that again, though let's we go ahead and help our young man first!",CHARACTER,Zeus,male
"Ah, little sprout. I was just notifying Lord Poseidon here that all of his domain exists because it pleases me; remember, my good foster-brother, I could freeze your oceans solid if I chose.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Ah, hahahah! Excellently stated, venerable Goddess Demeter! I'm reminded once more of your vast experience, though, I think we all prefer our oceans liquidy, isn't that right, Nephew?!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"To think, young sprout, our strategist Athena, warrior-goddess, sprang from Zeus' head! I would expect that no high intellect could come from there.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Please do not mind the Lady Demeter's good-natured sense of humor, Zagreus. She and my father often like to jest with one another, even in the most difficult times.",CHARACTER,Athena,female
"Young Zagreus, once you arrive, do tell Lord Ares here that his great power's not worth anything without my own. Wars have their causes, among which, many I control.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I do not question that your influence can stir a mortal's impulses toward war, O Goddess Demeter. At least we can agree that our domains are quite compatible!",CHARACTER,Ares,male
"Remember something for us, Zagreus. A frozen heart holds no sway over anyone at all. Isn't that right, oh Aphrodite, dear?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Oh, I don't know, my dearest Demeter! The frozen heart has tendency to thaw, and then begin to beat with renewed vigor after that. I trust your time shall come! It can never be too late, except for mortals, the poor things.",CHARACTER,Aphrodite,female
"Why, Zagreus, my gentle Artemis here was just saying how concerned she was for your predicament! I'm sure she'd like it if we both could help you in this case.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Concerned? I don't see anyone concerned, you have this, Zagreus! You don't need anybody's help, and you can get through this all on your own, though just in case, and I mean just in case! Um, here.",CHARACTER,Artemis,female
"The crops shall wither and decay so long as I may please, young Zagreus. Although we do have those upon Olympus who take issue with my reasoning...",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Erm, yeah, milady, I take issue here! I mean how are the grapes supposed to grow and wine supposed to flow when you are so uptight, now, just ease up a little there, let's see what we can do!",CHARACTER,Dionysus,male
"I see the noble King of the Olympians has reached you prior to me, Zagreus. I wonder which of all his many lies he's told you last.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My foster-brother's wayward son appears! I, too, once lost a child, Zagreus. I was quite foolish with her from the start. Her father was a baseborn farm-boy; worshiped me! He's gone as well, of course. Only the cold remains.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My daughter to a baseborn farm-boy, she... why, little sprout, I wasn't very kind to her, I think. Certainly not once her father passed. It was her mortal blood that made her weak! Born to mortals, taken by mortals, I suspect. So now, they pay.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I don't suppose... no, it is nothing, little sprout, it's just... I hear such wicked rumors now and then, about my daughter, lost to me, and what became of her. Kore, we called her, then. Persephone is what she called herself. Before she vanished utterly, leaving no trace....",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"After my daughter Kore disappeared, I left this mountaintop. Wandered the earth, in search. For naught, of course. It was a necessary journey, I suppose. May yours fare better.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Hope Mother knows what she's doing, in the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Demeter, this is for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's all of this, young Zagreus, a message of some sort, for me, indeed? I... can't decipher it, although... it bears the marks of my two foster-brothers here, and... well! It seems we'd better compare notes!",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Why, little sprout, young Zagreus... my grandson! I can scarce believe it, still! To think that, Kore, or... Persephone, my daughter... she had been with Foster-Brother Hades, all this time! A match I wouldn't have expected... or approved. That's why she left! Our blasted hearts do what they want.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My little grandson, little sprout, I've thought... if my Persephone's alive, why then... this winter, hasn't it endured for long enough...? It's grown to have a certain stubbornness, but I... I am the goddess of the seasons, Zagreus. Perhaps it's time I changed them once again.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I've lifted the cold from the earth, much as I said I would, grandson. But, near your father's realm... I have decided it shall stay the way it is. Bereft of warmth. As a reminder to us all, about all this.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You bear the blessing of Poseidon, Zagreus? Someday I shall remind him of his place, and freeze his watery domain entirely.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Athena has imparted you her wisdom, Zagreus? A simulacrum of the real thing, at any rate. True wisdom only comes with age, I think.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"All of the love and beauty in the world can wither in a season, Zagreus. Remember that when next the goddess Aphrodite makes her promises.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Lord Ares already got hold of you, has he? He's good at making mortals kill each other, yes. But he has utterly no knack for subtlety.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The gentle Artemis already found you, Zagreus? She takes my orders well; one cannot blame her, for she'd have nothing to hunt if not for me.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You stumbled into Dionysus, Zagreus? One of these days I shall prevent his vineyards all from ripening; put to the test his carefree attitude.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The mark of Chaos is upon you, isn't it? A force older than I! Yet one which you ought not trust so readily. No rhyme or reason to that one at all.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Is that the bloodlike stain of pomegranate on you, Zagreus? A hardy fruit resistant to a winter's chill. How fascinating they survive, down there.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I don't often divulge such blessings as I am about to, Zagreus. Don't thank me for it, but make certain that you use my power well.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I have affection for you, little sprout. No need for reciprocity, but now I'll offer you the fiercest of my capabilities.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I must admit I have grown fond of you, young sprout; nevertheless, I shall not spoil you like some ill-mannered child.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My, but you're as determined as my foster-brothers were, when my sisters and I stood with them 'gainst the Titans way back when.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Our family, why, I think we understand something of loss, now, don't we, Zagreus? Unlike the mortals on the surface. Always begging me for plenty. They'll get none. But as for you, I have a plethora to offer!",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You are entirely too young to have had meaningful experience with loss, young Zagreus. Pray to me that you never have to learn.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You live within the bosom of the earth, and know its warmth. But there is no such warmth up here, young Zagreus. You truly wish to feel the bitter cold of the outside? Then, here.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Someday, you'll gain the surface, Zagreus; and you shall see firsthand what mortalkind has wrought. You'll find it has some commonality with your domain.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Motherhood's a curse, young Zagreus. Be thankful you're immune. You sprang from Nyx herself, or so I hear? I sprang from Theia, whoever she was. And I once bore a child, too. Long gone. A mother's work... isn't it such a waste?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Your father Hades and I share a common fate, each having lost a child fully grown; except that he's a hollow fool, whose child left! Whereas my daughter never would have. Ever!",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Your father always had a sternness to him that his brothers lacked. Thought him a decent sort, comparatively anyway; though evidently he is no such thing.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Should you achieve your goal, and see this surface-world, Zagreus, I've but one bit of knowledge to impart: Don't ever fall for mortals. Use them if you must, but do not waste your love on those who waste away.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I have a brother, Helios, the Sun. A nonsense-talker with a flaming chariot. Why, he once told me that my Kore, that she went into that Underworld of yours! Preposterous. The clouds now blot him out entirely.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"This land is not unlike your own in certain ways. For, Helios the Sun has not shone down upon it for some time. How long, I really couldn't tell you, little sprout! Long enough for mortals to take notice, certainly.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My sisters Hestia and Hera surely would assist as well, young sprout. Except they and our foster-brothers haven't been getting along of late. Though as for me? I'll never leave this mountaintop of mine.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"We all are willful children, are we not? I'm daughter to Hyperion, you know; a Titan so obscure and hated that Lord Zeus, he started calling me his birth-sister, so much did he dislike this bit of truth! And to get a rise out of me, too.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"As seasons give to one another, so do generations, I suppose. Hyperion, my father? He'd not a one redeeming quality. My sisters and my foster-brothers and myself; this world owes us a debt for ridding it of him and his kind.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I ought to warn you that my foster-brother Zeus, he has just a disgusting sense of humor, little sprout. He'd have you think he sired half the countryside! I have to shudder at the very thought.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"There's so much nonsense that the mortals say to one another of our family, Zagreus. How viciously the rumors spread! Whether from that oaf, Zeus, or likely from the mortal drunkard-poets with no better use of their limited time!",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I warn you, Zagreus, best not to make attempts to grow much closer with me, thus. I'm much your elder, after all, and you're my little sprout. What say we keep it that way, hm?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I... I am so very moved, I... have a daughter once again. And... I've a grandson, too! I thought, I felt something when first I met you, but... I brushed it off. Just like a fleck of snow...",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Someday, my little sprout, you'll gain the surface of your father's realm, and see my handiwork. Until such time, I'll come to your aid as I can. It's quite the entertaining pastime, honestly!",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"By the way, we had entirely a lovely time within your father's house, Grandson. And, to see Kore once again, it... warmed my heart. I'm beyond grateful that your mother's safe. And that you've an important job to do. Here, I shall help.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I meant to tell you something, Grandson... you needn't have deceived the rest of us. You could have sent word that my daughter was with you down there, all along! Ah, but families are a complicated thing. Just swear that you'll be candid with us, next time.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You must visit us sometime up here, Grandson! I understand the surface hasn't been agreeable with you... though perhaps if not in this age, then the next, we shall have you over. It's brisk up here... but nice enough, I think.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Young sprout, I cannot fully understand my daughter's choices, such as what she saw in your gloom-filled father to have eloped with him. But if you are the result, then she is clearly wiser than I estimated.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I made mistakes raising your mother, sprout. When she was my Kore. I was blind to the possibility that she could have left me, but... I see it now. If you become a parent yourself, someday... may you listen more than I.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You tell my Kore... erm, Persephone, that is... the Queen! You tell her that her mother sends her warm regards. You tell her that. And you take care of her.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Grandson, my daughter Queen Persephone, she sent me the most precious message, courtesy of Hermes, as of late. I'm pleased to hear that you are getting on all right. Though, I know you're at work, so here!",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The Frostbitten Horn which you bear once overflowed. It holds a certain power still, of course. But never again shall mortalkind take it for granted.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The heat has risen quite considerably there, is that not so? Then if my foster-brother's tampered with the temperature, I'll have to cool things off.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The heat of your surroundings must be difficult to bear, my little sprout. It's fortunate I've just the thing for that.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"That chill sensation I detect must indicate that you are near the surface, Zagreus. If you can overcome the final challenges ahead, you soon shall see the long winter yourself.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"That's Sister Hera's Heart-Seeker you have! The very weapon which she used to put our predecessors down. It hasn't lost its potency I see. Fear not, I shall not mention this to her, if I see her.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Why, isn't that there Sister Hestia's oddly constructed armament you bear? She always was so predisposed to flame; I thought she'd never give it up! If it's to be in any hands, then may as well be yours.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I scarcely can see... are those the Twin Fists that you bear, young sprout? I once made ample use of them myself, if you'll imagine it. Wielding the cold since has been adequate for me, but you? May you put them to work as I once did.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Why, you've the look of one who has endured a terribly long winter, Zagreus! I trust you'll cling to life a little longer, now.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I sense your grip on life is coming loose, young Zagreus. Now turn that cold you feel against your enemies.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You seem to be in dire need of some assistance, Zagreus. I think perhaps I have a bit to spare.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You're in the winter of your current stretch of life, aren't you, Zagreus? Do try and live a little longer for me, hm?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You waste away just like a common mortal, Zagreus. How rather unbecoming of a god.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The flame of life is easily extinguished by the cold, young Zagreus. Surely you feel the warmth within you giving way?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Cold comfort for your terrible predicament, young Zagreus, but I am here.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Last time I felt a chill like this was... on the surface, but, who...? Well, one way to find out. Then, in the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I understand, young Zagreus, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this bitter cold? Quite honestly I fail to see why. But I'll aid your plight, why not? For I can offer plenty of assistance, and you soon shall grow fond of it, I think.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I once had plentitudes of blessings I would offer readily, young Zagreus; but I am feeling not as generous of late.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Did you detect perhaps a certain spirit-shaking chill within the air, young Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Plenty of blessings left to go around; although, only for you, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Your enemies shall have no shelter from the cold whilst I am at your side, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"There's something to the barrenness, where you reside; perhaps someday it shall be more like that up here.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Your realm there is much like the wind-swept surface here. Mostly devoid of life, such as it's been of late.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Olympus must seem like a distant paradise to you, young Zagreus; it is a frozen waste to me. But still, it's home.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Your foes shall more than catch cold by the time we're through, don't you agree, young sprout?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"All those who stand opposed to you, why, we shall shatter more than their resolve, I think, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
One of these seasons I suppose I ought to double-check the mortals haven't gone extinct without my intervention at each step.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"None can endure an everlasting winter's chill, young Zagreus; not even your father's lifeless servants there beneath the earth.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The seasons have a certain beauty to them, I suppose. Though struggle onward, and you needn't take my word for it.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
I've known your father and his brothers here for many seasons now; they bicker endlessly with me and one another.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I have to tell you something, little sprout. I take cold comfort knowing that my foster-brother Hades is no better at his parenting than I.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I'd gladly scour all your father's realm if doing so would free you from his clutches, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I'll have you know something, young Zagreus: The bitter cold and frost is just as inescapable as death itself.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The seasons turn relentlessly, without regard, and thusly should you doggedly push forward on your path.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I shall bring desolation upon those who wrong you, little sprout.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I hope that you're aware how seldomly I give my blessing as of late, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"There's no escaping from the bitter cold, you know.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Your adversaries soon shall know something of loss, I think.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
Let us see to it your foes are left with nothing.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"There shall be only souls for harvesting this day, I think, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My warm regards, and all my blessings to you, little sprout.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The bitterness of cold and death go hand in hand, I do suppose.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"When all is taken away, the cold yet remains, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I am not feeling quite so generous of late, young Zagreus, but nevertheless: Choose.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
Your lifeless foes must foolishly believe they've nothing left to lose.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Go with my blessings, Zagreus; though you may take but one.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
Decay is the inevitable state of things; we are merely helping it along.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
The cold of Mount Olympus shall bring utter ruin on your enemies.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Death and cold, they are irrevocably bound together, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The climate in those depths needs cooling, then, I take it, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You bring with you the season of decay, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
Your foes shall all wither before you like unwatered crops.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The frost eventually shall cover everything, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You'll find that life gives way quite easily to cold, young sprout.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Look carefully upon my blessings, Zagreus, and take no more than one.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female

"I seldom feel too generous of late, and yet for you, young Zagreus? Why not.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
I once offered the mortals generosities as this in much more copious supply.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"It soon shall be exceptionally cold down in the Underworld, I think.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female

"My finest winter blessings to you, little sprout.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female

"I'm here to ease some of your burdens, my young sprout. That's what we grandmothers are for.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I trust you're keeping yourself warm enough in all of this, Grandson?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female

"Persephone is doing well here on Olympus, Zagreus. You ought to visit, too, sometime.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Be thankful that the rivers to your realm have not yet frozen over, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
I trust your ferry-boatman Charon has no qualms about the freezing temperatures up here?,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My message comes to you by river-boat this time, young Zagreus. At least that Charon is amenable to our attempts to contact you.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"My blessing's seldom given and ought not be so readily refused, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I am accustomed to such disrespect from all those blasted mortals, Zagreus, but you?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"If you are so disinterested in my generosity, young Zagreus, then you shall have my wrath.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I don't recall if I yet warned against this type of attitude, although it doesn't matter either way.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Do you believe I give my blessings liberally, Zagreus? Well then I've news for you.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Offend me, and I'll drain the last traces of color from those cheeks of yours.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"That was an ill-advised decision, Zagreus. I'm past quickly forgiving such mistakes.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"You truly think you can withstand the ravages of winter, Zagreus? That I would like to see.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"A harsh winter is coming for you, Zagreus. And I'm afraid you've brought it on yourself.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"For that decision, Zagreus, it is about to be a very cold day down there in your Underworld.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"A careless choice you've made, there, Zagreus. As you grow long in years, perhaps you shall learn better judgment as to whom to trust, and whom to never, ever disrespect.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I'm sorry, Demeter.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Forgive me, Demeter.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"It ultimately isn't my intent to leave you in the cold like this, young Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The freezing cold ought to have drained the life from you; but I've allowed it to relent, for now.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Next time, young Zagreus, perhaps I'll take every last bit of warmth you've left down there.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I am the eldest of Olympus, Zagreus. And I expect for you to treat me suitably.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"The harsh of winter's gone for now, young Zagreus; and so take heart, but also you take heed.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"So you survived a little winter's chill, didn't you, there? Be careful, though; next season could be worse.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Remember, next time, Zagreus, that on my whim I can take everything from you.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"I am quite capable of making your life plenty difficult, you do now realize, young Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Demeter,female
Perhaps a few more winter seasons such as that might teach you more of how this world works.,CHARACTER,Demeter,female
"Enough; I do not hold to grudges, Zagreus. You've my good graces, and my temper's cooled, for now.",CHARACTER,Demeter,female

Time for a boost.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Right on time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There he is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Message for me?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
He's back.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What... he meant Skelly's tooth?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's going on, there, Coz? Can I call you Coz? Got something here for you should make your battles to the death end that much quicker!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Sorry, boss, my pop had pressing matters to attend to. But I'm here! Relaying you that message, and relaying this.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Here to tell you that Poseidon's on his way, boss. Sometimes he is a little slow. But you'll meet up with him again eventually!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Expecting someone else, there, boss? A certain half-sister of mine perchance? Well, tough break, I got here first. Want one of these, or not?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Soon as I heard you were looking to see Ares, boss, I got here as fast as I could! He's never going to beat me. Much less in all that armor.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Aphrodite said she's running just a little late, Coz, though I'm sure you understand. Besides, I'm here! In spirit anyhow.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Wanted to let you know my sister Artemis is out looking for you. You should be running into her in any chamber, now!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Afraid that Dionysus couldn't be here for you, boss. Though punctuality has never been one of his stronger suits.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"That chill you were expecting in the air, that wasn't Demeter this time, here, boss! No, that was just me whisking to you in a flash. Makes for a little pleasant breeze I think!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You did it, Coz! And by it I'm referring to the act of beating down my seemingly invincible boatman associate, who fancies himself pretty tough as Underworld deities go! He wasn't sure you had it in you, and if I may be so bold, neither was I!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey looking like you're getting some good use out of that fancy plume of yours! Keep going like that, maybe someday you'll be half as quick as me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I got a keen eye, boss, so I happened to notice that you've got a certain tooth you're carrying about. Know you're from the land of the dead and all, but don't you think that comes across as just a little odd?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Heard that you finally got out of there, Coz! Big congratulations due for that: Congrats! The secret's safe with me, of course! The others here, they think you're still at it. Though, I guess you are!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I heard a certain someone's back at home with you down there now, Coz! I'd call it wonderful news, except it isn't news, at least not yet! Though if the time comes that you want to spread the word, just give the signal here!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I get to be the messenger this time. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lord Hermes? Got here as quickly as I could.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Why, that looks like you've got a message just for me, this time, how special is that, boss? Some sort of invite from the looks of things. You sure that I'm supposed to have this, seeing as I'm not officially involved?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got to tell you, Coz, that was a real something of a feast back your place! A little awkward, having to pretend we just met, but hey, I'm an Olympian! Means I can posture with the best of them. Good times, Coz! Glad it all worked out.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Afraid your regularly scheduled Olympian could not be here right now, because I'm that much faster, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You might have been expecting someone else, here, boss. But I just couldn't help beating them to the punch this time!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got here just as quickly as I could, Coz. Which turns out to be quite a bit faster than my relatives!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I'm sure that keepsake that you brought will come in handy soon enough, there, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
My relatives are normally quite quick to heed the call of anybody bearing one of their keepsakes! Huh!,CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I may not be the god you're looking for right at the moment, boss, but I will get you on your way to them in no time here!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You heard already from my pop, haven't you, Coz? Wonderful guy. Don't get to spend a lot of time together, though! You know how that is. Well, see you!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know, Coz, my pop never gives his lightning blessings to me! He's quite invested in what happens to you, isn't he?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Want to bring you in on something, boss. Reason that Uncle Poseidon got to you before I did is, I let him. He's under the impression he's as spry as ever! Hah!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"So then Athena's looking out for you, that's good, that's good! She likes to put a lot of thought and stuff in everything, it's all a little much, if you ask me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know who keeps me awful busy, Coz? Ares. Nothing like a good old war amongst the mortals to create demand for lots and lots of messages to go around!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Did Artemis manage to locate you already, boss? She's pretty good at that, I have to say. I'm faster! But she's fast, she's pretty fast, all right.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Aphrodite's really something, don't you think so, Coz? Normally I'd stop for no one here. But when it comes to her, exceptions must be made!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You ever get the feeling life's been moving all too quickly for you, boss? Well Dionysus doesn't, as you're probably aware. Throws quite a feast, though!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Been downright chilly up here lately, Coz! We've Demeter to thank for that! Me, I try to stay out of her way, she doesn't think I'm of much help to her. Although I'm sure she's warmed to you at least!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Say, isn't that your father's blessing on you, Coz?! I almost can't believe it, but you've done such a good job of things, how could he not approve?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Whoa, what's good, there, Coz? Though, who am I kidding, we can cut the small talk. I don't mind. I interrupt my brothers and my sisters all the time!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Boss, you've probably caught yourself thinking: Hermes sure is quick! So how come it took so long for him to show up in the first place? Well, I'm afraid that's not for you to know. But! It's not because I was late. Not late for anything.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, uh, could you do a little favor for me, Coz? My brothers, sisters, family, and whatnot, they're unaware I'm working with you, here. It's no big deal, but let's keep it that way for now. All right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Happened to be in the area, boss! Seeing as the mortal folk up here keep dying off, and someone's got to bring their souls to your domain, now, don't they.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Know that saying 'don't be hasty', boss? That comes from me. I swear! A little way to stave off competition, masquerading as the wisdom of a sage. Those stupid mortals will buy anything!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Not that I really know exactly what you're up to, Coz, but! If I did, I don't think anybody on Olympus is aware of it. Or, if they are, they're keeping their mouths shut. The same as me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You ever wonder how I got this fast, Coz? Lots of practicing, I'll tell you that! And being born unnaturally quick, I guess!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Once took a skinny little chap down to the Underworld, got the business end of a sharp spear, he did! He had it coming, though, a lot of lying, cheating, and the like. Last that I heard, he's still making his amends down there. Eh!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Boss, I know you've heard a certain rumor from a very skinny individual who's uninclined to move. You best keep that one to yourself, all right? Or else our jig is up, and your father wouldn't like that, nor would you. So, cheers!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Say, you're in good with what's-his-name, the one who gave you his lucky tooth? So he's an all-right sort, then. Has to be, if you put up with him!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"So, now you've found me out, haven't you, Coz? Heard from the big boat-man himself. Well, good! We're pleased to be of service. And we've got a lot of dirt on you, so you be sure to keep our secrets, too. All right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"So my professional associate, the fearsome boatman on the River Styx? You got to know him pretty well in all of this, right, Coz? Hard getting through to him, I know, but his heart's in the right place! It's why I'm working with him, after all this time!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Heard you've been seeing the Fury, Megaera, Coz? Got the impression she was quite a handful, though I guess the same can probably be said of you, there, huh? You two have fun!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I can't believe you got into a fight with my professional associate, you daft or something, Coz? Just about everybody that I know, they're all at least a little bit afraid of that one and his boat, yet you think you can take him, huh?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"So you took on my good professional associate, is that right, Coz? And you beat the big boatman himself! I knew you were pretty tough, but not that tough! Impressive work! He's impressed, too. He isn't even mad!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, uh, so I kind of placed a bet with the old boatman, my associate that is, that you could beat him in a fight, twice in a row! No pressure, or anything, but just in case you prove me right one of these days, I would appreciate it, Coz!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message from Olympus for you, boss! It says, 'It sure is nice up here upon this mountain, not having to escape the Underworld! Come join us soon, won't you?'",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message for you, boss. It says, 'You're rather slow. If only somebody could help you out with that.' Huh, fancy that, what a coincidence!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got you a message, Coz. Says here, ahem: 'Hurry up and get out of there already.' It's from the surface of the earth, says so right here.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Another message here! It says, 'One small spoon dried oregano, two spoons extra virgin olive oil, one large onion, minced, a dash of salt to taste,' wait, this isn't for you. Though you should try it sometime if you ever make it out!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message for you, Coz, it says, 'On behalf of all Olympus, we would like for you to know that was a right good bottle of Ambrosia that you offered to the god of travel, Hermes, who appreciated every drop.' Sincerely, me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Another message for you, Coz, this one says, 'Hey, mate! If you ever do make it up here up on this mountaintop for whatever reason, we should hang out, all right? I can show you around.'  Your friend, Hermes.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know, boss, just between us? Out of all special delivery recipients I've had over the ages, here, I've got to say, you're the most interesting one!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know, Coz, all this time that I've been bussing souls across the borders of your father's land, it's good to have the chance to help somebody out the other way!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, Coz, you're now well accustomed to our little chats, but I want you to level with me here. You're the boss, if you prefer, I would be happy to shut up, no harm no foul. Just give the signal, hey?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Perish the thought, Lord Hermes. It's been great hearing from you from time to time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, all right, boss. Just making sure that I'm not interrupting anything!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Now that you mention it, Lord Hermes, yes, let's keep our interactions nice and quick.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I hear you, boss, we'll cut straight to the chase next time, all right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Ahem! Pardon the interruption, boss. You let me know if you prefer that I pipe up again next time, more like I used to!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I miss hearing from you, Hermes. Let's carry on like we did before.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hah, sure thing, boss. It's good to have a chat from time to time!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Appreciate you checking in, Lord Hermes. I think we should keep at it like we have been, nice and quiet.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No problem whatsoever, boss. Just checking in.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Thought I'd check in again real quick, there, boss. You want my witty conversation next time, or straight to the Boons?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know, yes, let's go back to having witty conversation from you, Hermes. That sounds great.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hah, good! I like these little chats! Take care, now, boss.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Straight to the Boons, Lord Hermes. We both appreciate cutting straight to the chase.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I get it, boss. Words are too slow, aren't they. Won't bother you again word-wise, but I'll be seeing you!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Thought I'd check in again real quick, there, boss. You want my witty conversation next time, or straight to the Boons?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Definitely witty conversation, Lord Hermes. Boons are more than welcome after that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hah! Good, I like these little chats! Take care, now, boss.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Straight to the Boons, Lord Hermes. We both appreciate cutting straight to the chase.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I get it, boss. Words are too slow, aren't they. Won't bother you again word-wise, but I'll be seeing you!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Met your father face to face only the one time, Coz. Despite rendering services to him for quite a while. Memorable experience, I'll give it that! Seems like he's not done anything with all the messages my side keeps sending him.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You're pretty close with Thanatos, aren't you, boss? We don't often run in the same lanes, though our duties sometimes intersect a bit. Odd chap. Seems good at what he does, though!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Saw Thanatos again lately, here, boss, and want to tell you, almost looked as though he cracked a smile when he mentioned you! Never seen anything like that with him!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I hear you're close with Orpheus down there, you get the chance, you tell him I said hey! He's pretty decent with that lyre of his, last time I checked.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey boss, in all your travels there, you happen to run into a lass by name Eurydice? Hope she's all right! I feel bad because we didn't get a proper send-off last we met.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I caught wind you found Eurydice down there, that's great! Long as she's on the up and up, I can eject her from the tiny worry center of my mind.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"That's quite a nice Bone Hourglass you got, there, boss! So you're in good with my professional associate, as well. A real gentleman!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Why, look at you, there, boss! I recognize that fancy plume you got! Just an iota of my speediness in there, but still! Much more than most can do.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Whoa, what's gotten into all those lifeless wretches that you're always fighting with down there? They're really moving lately! Whatever's made them go all out, it wasn't me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got all your father's lifeless wretches hot and bothered, going all out all because of that Forced Overtime condition of his, isn't that right, Coz? Well, if they're interested in getting things done quickly, I am sure you can oblige them in a bit!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Looks like those lifeless wretches you're contending with down there are really on the move this time around, aren't they, boss? Oh, well, you're faster still, I'm sure!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Somebody's on a tight deadline, I take it, Coz? Courtesy of your father's Pact, well, you believe me, I know how that is, so I won't keep you, just keep moving, right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I realize you're on a tight deadline, there, boss, so let's dispense with all unnecessary chit-chat here and get you on your merry way, posthaste!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You racing against time to keep things interesting, or what, there, boss? Turns out that time goes pretty quick. I like racing against it, too!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hah! Can't help but notice you've been timing yourself, boss! Good habit that. Keep an eye on the time, you'll get faster and faster! Not as fast as me, mind.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know, Coz, since you're timing yourself, case you haven't noticed, doesn't count against you when we stop to have these chats! Insisted on that little rule myself.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, you stopped timing yourself, boss, everything all right? If that's not a cry for help, well, I don't know what is. Um, here!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Good, boss, I can see you're clocking yourself once again. Little term I like to use, means beating yourself up whilst keeping time!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Look, Coz, if you aren't always going to time yourself, that is a choice of lifestyle I have to respect. And learn to understand.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Another message from Olympus, boss. This goes, 'Zagreus, take absolutely all the time you need making your way to us; we know the going must be treacherous, and we assure you our support, however long it takes.' Well, how about that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Heard you got through pretty quick last time! Not bad, not bad!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You'd think that once you break free to the surface we could see you from Olympus a bit more than usual, but no! It's like you're shrouded in eternal night up here, hm? Something like that. Odd, right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, you beat your fastest time fighting through all of that! Not that I'm keeping track! I'm keeping track.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey Coz, that last run-through that you did, I almost can't believe how quick you pulled that off! You're really pretty good!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, you got out of there in practically no time at all before! Let's see if you can have another go like that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You're getting faster, Coz, keep at it, just like that! Can always go a little faster than before is what I always say!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, Coz, looks to me you beat your fastest time climbing up out of there! That's nicely done! Can you go faster still?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"What do you know, you beat your personal best time escaping recently! I hope my blessing helped a bit with that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Well look at you, Coz! Rushing to victory after successive victory. Caught wind of your accomplishments down there! Well then, let's keep the streak alive!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Heard the news you broke your streak of victories of late, boss. Happens, right? You seem the sort to bounce right back, though. Let me help with that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"So you get to keep breaking out of there, time after time, so that your father can keep finding ways to make it even harder to escape? Something like that? Sounds like an interesting assignment, Coz!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Everybody on Olympus, they're still going on about Persephone, Queen of the Underworld! They had no idea she was down there all along, none whatsoever, Coz! And as for me, now I can deliver you my blessings more officially, I think!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Even though everything's out in the open, now, and all my brothers, sisters, and whatnot are going to keep helping you fight your way out of there, I've still been keeping to myself, of late! That way nobody slows me down.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Some members of the family up here, I know they haven't helped at all, but just don't take it personal or anything, all right? Think of it this way: You've got more of us getting along and talking properly than I have ever seen!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Your mother got from there just fine, don't worry, Coz! She had me looking after her, and such. Seemed real nice! Told me to tell you hi.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You know, I never knew the pomegranate seeds down in the Underworld held such power if not for your mother mentioning it, Coz! And here I thought they were just tasty, that was it!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Thought I'd check up on you, there, boss. You doing well, everything good and all? Can't hear you one iota, mind, so then, don't answer that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Come quickly, boss! You need to hurry up and get out of there, you're running out of time!! You're not, really, but it's a bit of motivation, hey?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Oh, you ready for this, boss? Got you the Premium Express this time. Absolute cream of the crop right here! You're going to go real far.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Guess what, Coz? It's the Premium Express, delivered straight to you, fresh from the richest mountaintop up here! You're going to like this.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Express-delivered message for you, Coz. It says: 'Congratulations! You're my hundredth customer today.' And here is what you get!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Eugh, I have to tell you, you look awful, Coz. You're barely holding on! Let's see if we can't perk you right back up.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Whew! Looks like times hit you hard since last we had a run-in, Coz. Well, when life is tough, just hurry through the rubbish bits, I say!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Whoa you're a hot mess, there, Coz, what happened getting here? Ah well, I hope your travels run a little smoother here on out.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"There's a fine line between being quick and being hasty, boss. And if you're hurt as bad as I think, I think you might be on the hasty side!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Well, good news is you got to me, but I can tell you hit a lot of bad news on the way! You stay alive, all right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Oof! What happened getting here, boss? Let me guess, you got whipped, burned, beat up with spectral clubs... something like that?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You're looking worse for wear, I hate to tell you, boss. But, we can pick you up and get you going here, I think!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"This mark, almost like a bat wing. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey boss, found you, good. Hermes, at your service. Pleasure! You are the talk of Olympus! Normally I wouldn't get mixed up, but for you, I will be making an exception. Now, come on, we both got places to be!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"All right, Coz, here's the goods, fresh from our mountaintop. Take all the time you need deciding! If you want to be a slowpoke.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Won't need but a moment of your time, here, boss! And you'll more than make up for it right quick, you got my guarantee!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"All right, Coz, express delivery to where-in-blazes are you at right now? Anyway take one of these, and go about your business!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I know you're kind of in a hurry, boss. But let me show you what a real hurry's all about in just a moment here!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Package for you, boss! And I think you know what's inside. Well, maybe not exactly, but... just pick something, will you?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Come on, Coz, you can do this! And furthermore, I think you can do this rather quick! Now go!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"It's you, boss, that's good! But you're standing still! That's bad. Let's get you up and moving about again, all right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, boss! Not much to report up here. But I've not exactly come this far to bring you news, have I?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Afraid there's no one faster than myself, here, Coz. But good news is, you are about to close the gap a little bit!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Slow day so far, there, boss? Well all of that's about to change, you got my guarantee!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"How 'bout we pick the pace up just a little, Coz? Or maybe by a lot! Whatever you've the mood and stomach for right now.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Last thing I ever want to do is slow you down, boss. So, enough chit-chat. Now pick and go. Go!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You've got a ways to go yet, boss. Good news is, the slowest part of this particular trip is hereby over... now!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"All's well enough here on the surface, Coz. Though, sooner you can make it out of there, the better it'll be!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Another go up to the surface, boss? Might suggest that you be very quick about it. And might give you this!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Let's hustle, shall we, boss? Honestly, I don't know how the rest of you can stand it, trudging about like you don't have someplace to be!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hiya, boss! I'd ask what's new, but I already know! I have my ways. And you have to get right on out of there.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Wish I could just fly in and haul you out of there, Coz, but there's some rules even I can't break. Though nice to see you have a go of it!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I come with urgent tidings, boss! Unfortunately not addressed to you. But someone got you these!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Sorry, Coz, no messages this time. Guess that's what happens when your whole existence is kept secret from the world!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"There's not much new worth mentioning up here, though looks like you have got your hands full down there, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You've got a tough climb up ahead, Coz, so you just pace yourself, all right? Just kidding, go as quickly as you can. It works for me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Come on, now, boss, let's get you moving here!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got here in practically no time at all, boss. Ready now?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey Coz, package for you here. Knock yourself out!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got a customary care package for you, Coz.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey, what's it going to be this time, boss?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Come on, Coz, let's pick up the pace a bit!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Go get yourself out of there in a hurry, Coz.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"No rush, but go on and pick one of these, boss.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message for you, Coz: It says 'Take one, it's free, enjoy!'",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"What's going on, there, boss? Are things all right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You want the usual, or what, there, boss?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Special delivery and all that, boss! Here, take your pick.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey boss! You take one of these, and go for it.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Just so happened to be in the area, here, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Making sure you got this, Coz. You got this, Coz!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Here comes a little boost to get you up and out of there in no time, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Now, don't just stand there, Coz, pick one of these and go!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Your quickness is my number one priority, here, boss.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"No time to waste and so on, Coz. Now, choose!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Caught wind you need my services here, boss?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Thought I'd check in, Coz. See how things are going. Slow, right? Not for long.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
Ready to hustle? Good! I'll take that as a yes.,CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Let's get you quickly on your way, there, Coz!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message for you, boss. It says: 'Here, choose one of these, and go!'",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
Another message for you! This one says: 'Hey boss! Take this!',CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Just thought I'd check up on you, boss, and bring you this!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hope you enjoyed the life of being slow, because all that's about to change, right here!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"All right, boss, here, let's get you on your way!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Past time we got you out of there, right, boss?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Just thought I'd drop by, give you this, and go!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"We'll have you racing out of here in no time, Coz!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"How goes it underground of late, there, boss?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Nice day we're having on the surface! You should see it, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Another day, another race up to the top! You ready, boss?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Well, here we go again! Let's go, then, boss!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Got here as quickly as I could, boss. Now what say we get you promptly the hell out of there!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hey Coz, gathered you were just about to make another go of breaking out of there! Thought I'd stop by and give you a boost.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You're raring for your next trek out of there, right, boss? Well then I guess I got here just in time.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Heard you were heading out again, boss. Changed my schedule around a bit, not a big deal, and figured I'd drop in!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You're off again, are you? All right well then safe travels! Or swift travels, failing that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You ready for another go at this, Coz? Well then think I can speed you on your journey there.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Why, hello, Coz! Odd that we're running into one another here! Among the wares of my professional associate, I mean. Must be some sort of clerical mistake!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Why, hello, boss! Odd that we're running into one another here! Among the wares of my professional associate, I mean. Must be some sort of clerical mistake!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"You're well familiar with my professional associate, there, with the boat? Souls of the recently departed got to make it over to the Underworld somehow. Part of my job! I bring them in, he takes them down.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I guess I'm used to these one-sided chats here, boss, thanks to my work experience with my professional associate down there! You tell him I said hi, all right?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"A word of caution, Coz. Don't ask too many questions about me, or my professional associate down there. I hand souls over to him, and that's it, you understand?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Wouldn't you know it, boss! I was just minding my own business, handing off a few dearly departed souls to my professional associate, and who shows up, but you?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"My heavy-breathing professional associate was gracious enough to drop me off here with his other stuff, and for quite an affordable price, at that!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"All right, then, let's go make that spend of hard-earned coin well worth your while! What do you think, Coz?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I'd tell you not to ask too many questions of my good professional associate nearby, but then, who are we kidding, boss? Not like he'd answer you those questions anyhow!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message for you, boss, from my professional associate, who wanted you to know, and I quote, 'Hhhrrrrnnnngggggghhhhhh.'",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Been working with my good professional associate, the boatman there, since I-don't-know-how-long. Though, let me tell you, Coz, we haven't had a job quite like this yet!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Among the many ways in which you could parlay your earnings into better chances of survival here, I'm flattered you would think of me this time!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"How strange of a coincidence that you keep running into me along the riverside like this, don't you agree, there, Coz?",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Don't normally go selling off my blessings to the highest bidder, boss, but your bid there is good enough for me!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Lord Hermes, please accept this gift as a small token of my appreciation. Thank you for always keeping me on my toes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Mighty keen of you to leave a tip, there, boss. And I've a tip for you: Don't be slow! Maybe this will help with that.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Lord Hermes, please accept this gift as a small token of my appreciation. Thank you for always keeping me on my toes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Lord Hermes sir, you've asked for nothing in return, and so, please take this humble offering, because... it's nothing, really!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well now, that's awful kind, there, Coz! No need to thank me, though. Not so profusely anyhow!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Lord Hermes sir, you've asked for nothing in return, and so, please take this humble offering, because... it's nothing, really!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hermes, my friend? May I call you my friend? I hope this modest offering will lift your spirits but won't slow you down.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I look like I got the sort of time to sip Nectar, Coz? Well, guess what, I do! So, cheers!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Hermes, my friend? May I call you my friend? I hope this modest offering will lift your spirits but won't slow you down.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Hey, boss, I appreciate the tip. But just as a reminder, all my services are paid in full already! No need for special thanks. Though... cheers.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male

"You know, Coz, I got to say I had a few concerns when we first met, your father being who he is and all. But you're all right!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My rule is not to let things get too personal as far as work-related matters are concerned, Coz. But you're family! And, well, you're a right decent chap, I think. Offering up a bit of Nectar to me in the middle of all this!",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"This one's for you, swift and sure-footed messenger of the gods! You make what you do look easy. But I know you're going out of your way. Thank you so much, Hermes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I salute you, Lord Hermes, with this rarest of delicacies! Pretty rare here, anyway. You never show it, but I can only imagine how hard you must be working to back me up. Cheers, mate!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, the last time anybody offered me Ambrosia from the Underworld was never, before now! That's quite a gesture on your part. You could have just as well taken my services for granted and I'd not have minded in the least! But, thank you, Coz.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"I salute you, Lord Hermes, with this rarest of delicacies! Pretty rare here, anyway. You never show it, but I can only imagine how hard you must be working to back me up. Cheers, mate!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Message for you, Lord Hermes! It says, 'This offering is dedicated to the incomparable god of swiftness, from whom the news is always good, because he's bringing it. You are a real mate, you know that? I really owe you one.' Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, Coz, I am going to accept this choice Ambrosia from you one last time, all right? But from this point, I am doubling down on all professional responsibilities, here. Strictly business between us! Although, secretly, you're one of my best mates. Want you to know.",CHARACTER,Hermes,male
"Message for you, Lord Hermes! It says, This offering is dedicated to the incomparable god of swiftness, from whom the news is always good, because he's bringing it. You are a real mate, you know that? I really owe you one. Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

The fury of Olympus!,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Athena,droppedFemale
I strongly disapprove.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Athena,droppedFemale
I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Um... yes? Was I supposed to respond there?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I sense that you have not yet spoken with the all-seeing artifact you call Aegis. Tamper with the Fates' design, then, all you like. But if you change your mind, do speak the words to it: I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You have not yet used the waking-phrase that I imparted? Or perhaps you merely chose not to present me the result. I would quite like to see it, at some point. Remember, Son of Hades: Say to the all-seeing artifact, I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Out of the infinitely spanning possibilities, here before me stands the Son of Hades, bearing my all-seeing artifact, appearing in the aspect of a bearer yet unborn, who shall be known throughout the north as Beowulf. How very droll.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I faintly sensed that you were able to confront your father while in possession of my small round catalyst. It seems my asking you, and your success, was in accordance with the Fates' design, as well. The result is more amusing even than expected. Thus, thank you.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I have detected some unusual activity within the reaches of the Underworld, Son of Hades... vast sums of Darkness, collected in an ancient catalyst, which I see now almost like a beacon, shining in the night. This either is the work of Nyx, or you, or both. I am anticipating the result.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"It pleases me immensely, Son of Hades, to have seen the goddess Nyx again. The significant amount of time that has elapsed since last this happened dulled sufficiently old pains, I think. Thus, it becomes a basis on which our connection may, in time, take shape again.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"As we become acquainted, Son of Hades, I shall make myself quite clear in one respect: I fear I have a lack of patience for discussion. When visiting, please merely listen, then accept my mark, and then depart. Respond only when necessary. Or when prompted. Yes?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"...Merely listen, so it's just like when I get those messages from the Olympians. Wait, you did just prompt me, Master Chaos, didn't you? Or should I have remained silent just now?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I cannot offer you advice. But you were prompted, yes. You may speak freely, then, or anytime, despite my wishes that you not do so. Absolute silence is my general preference. It may not be yours.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I understand that Zeus and all his kin on Mount Olympus think that you are born of Hades and the goddess Nyx? I was amused to learn of this deception. Nyx has mothered many of the Underworld's own, so, why not you?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"She isn't my birthmother, no, but she is like a mother to me. Do you know her?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I know the goddess Nyx quite well, of course. Though, it has been a while since we last communicated, and I fear... well, I was not the charitable sort, back then. It is my hope that Nyx is faring well.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I knew you would arrive. But only in the moments prior to the fact. Thus, I am experiencing residual surprise. Your movements through the Underworld are as though a veil of darkness enshrouds you. The goddess Nyx's influence, perhaps? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I... do not know how to respond to that, exactly, Master Chaos, but, Nyx, yes, she has been aiding me, in my attempts to flee my father's realm.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You move in darkness, not as infinitely black as hers, but reminiscent to me, nonetheless. I would invite her to try to elude me, and then attempt to locate her. A minor amusement for the both of us. Now, I have you for this, I see.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Lately, Son of Hades, I have sensed what I would call a sort of shift within your father's residence. Did something noteworthy occur, perhaps? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Master Chaos, it's Persephone, my mother. She's returned! She's chosen to return. So... things feel different, certainly, with her around, although... I didn't feel any sort of shift.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You may not sense these shifts as I. The lightness of this space bends and adjusts with time. What you describe... it must have been the cause. I trust that the occasion is a welcome one. And I am pleased that you returned, nevertheless.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Again I sensed some sort of shifting in your father's residence. You seek to ask something of me about it, do you not? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Oh, I'm glad you asked, it's just... my mother, she's... we're reaching out to the Olympians. Trying to reconnect the family. It's been a while, relatively, since she and Father saw the others, but... in case a gathering occurs, I did wish you to know you're cordially invited, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Cordially invited...? A generous proposal, Son of Hades, though unless your gathering is to occur within my space, please understand it would be difficult for me to bring the full entirety of my presence there. However... I think I can arrange to be with you in some capacity. Thank you.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"It pleases me your gathering of the Olympians occurred. I must inform you... I had never once before detected quite so many of my offspring in a single space. At least not without violent intent. I appreciate that you included me, and that you have returned. Shall we continue, then?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
It pleases me your gathering of the Olympians occurred. I must inform you... I had never once before detected quite so many of my offspring in a single space. At least not without violent intent.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You bear the blessing of the great Lord Zeus. He still believes he holds dominion over both heaven and earth. I think, perhaps, he has forgotten about me.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Lord Poseidon offered you his blessing, it would seem. He can be rather boastful and belligerent, exhibiting the most unattractive manners of your father and Lord Zeus alike.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"This wise goddess Athena has imbued you with her charms, I see, O Son of Hades. Perhaps to her you are a tool with which her broken family may as yet be mended.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"It is not unexpected that you consorted with the violent Ares, and now bear his Boon. He still worships me, you know; yet, I would say he does not know me very well.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The charms of goddess Aphrodite are upon you unmistakably, although I shall be curious to see if her command over one's sense of love shall have any effect beneath the earth.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I understand the hunting-goddess Artemis recently has turned her gaze towards you. It is unexpected she would offer her assistance, even to a relative in need.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The drunkard Dionysus offered you his services, I see? He can be rather unpredictable, and therefore offers me a source of some amusement.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Swift Hermes spurs you on, I see, O Son of Hades. Beware the narrow distance between hastiness and swiftness; a distinction I am not so sure the god of travel fully understands.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Embittered Demeter has reached you, hasn't she? She once was full of warmth, you know; but lately, as I understand, she is more prone to taking it away.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You have met many of the Olympians by now, each spurring you toward their mountaintop. They place such value on familial bonds, yet none of them remember who I am. Do not place too much faith in them, O Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I ask you listen but not speak, O Son of Hades, whilst the Olympians? They do not ask at all. They merely send their messages to you, unprompted, providing a choice of blessing, but no say. I seek to understand their point of view. But it is difficult.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"When you extend an offering to the Olympians, for a fleeting instant, it appears as though they are able to hear your prayer. Or so I have observed. How interesting that your thoughts are capable of breaking free, yet you cannot.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Your father and his brothers, when they sealed the Titans in the darkest reaches of this world, that was the last they saw of me, as well. You are dissimilar from them, and I feel safe communicating thus with you.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I was at times uncharitable with the goddess Nyx, when we were closer, long ago. After she bore her first children, I nevertheless expected her attention to remain undivided. I kept creating. When finally I slowed, I realized my mistake. But our connection had been severed, by that point.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I sense that something is the matter, Son of Hades. Speak, then, what is on your mind? I can decipher some of it without your telling though would rather hear it from you voluntarily.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Erm, Master Chaos? The goddess Nyx, she... seems to want to speak with you again. I wonder, would you maybe contact her sometime? She seems convinced it is your move to make if you so choose.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The goddess Nyx wishes to hear from me...? Now that is unexpected, Son of Hades, and I wonder if, perhaps, this is a jest of yours. Though, your intentions evidently are sincere. Then, I shall make no promises in this, except that... I am considering the possibility.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Son of Hades, should eventually you spawn your own offspring... I recommend maintaining sub-infinite distances with them in space and time. Even if they are most tiresome, there always seems to come a point when one wishes to be in their presence once again.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"After some consideration, and on your recommendation, I attempted lately to make contact with the goddess Nyx again. She is quite distant from me now, of course. If you happen to know... did she receive the message well? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Well, Master Chaos, she can be a little difficult to read at times, but... I got the impression she was quite surprised, even excited to have heard from you again. She said that she would think about how to respond. Or, whether to respond.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I see. Well, she shall find a way, if it is warranted. I always did expect the world from her. There were times when I expected her to shine as bright as day, though she is Night. When she achieved a certain level of ability... she left. And I could not find her.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"My daughter, the goddess Nyx. When I learned the Olympians mistakenly assumed she was your mother, I did not fully consider the possibility that she essentially was a mother to you... the technicality of birth, aside. She cares for you to the extent a mother can.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Prior to your intervention, Son of Hades, I expected that the goddess Nyx had forgotten about me... whether purposefully, or from passage of time. I believed that to be forgotten was the one true inevitability. Perhaps, however, I was incorrect.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I find that it is difficult maintaining my connection with many consciousnesses, such as yours, and that of the goddess Nyx. Yet I am also finding that this difficulty is fully warranted. Our connections give me much to consider as I await our next exchange.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Ah, here is my favorite among those immortals dwelling underneath the Earth. How may I change your life today, O Son of Hades?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"May you enjoy a moment's peace within my space before venturing on in uncertainty. To my surprise, I must admit I do appreciate the company.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Have you grown trusting yet of the Olympians, for all their generosity? Perhaps you ought to let them know the truth about your journey's goal. They are vain, and think that it is them you seek.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I'll never get out of here if not for their help, but... I can't let them know about Mother. She wants to remain hidden from them.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A difficult position to be in, Son of Hades. The Olympians may not appreciate being misled. But you can trust that I shall keep your secret. I wish to see how your predicament plays out.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Such darkness emanates from you, O Son of Hades, that I once again did not entirely anticipate you would arrive just now. I suspect even your father must have difficulty keeping track of you through the domain he calls his own.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You move in darkness, practically unseen, Son of Hades. It is quite difficult even for me to sense your presence at times. The Olympians catch their glimpses now and then. But you are always in a shroud. Thus is the influence of Nyx.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"How strange it is to be subjected to the Fates. But do not fall into the cognitive delusion that they have already made your choices for you, Son of Hades. Rather, they are keen about anticipating every choice that everyone shall make. Such as the following.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I sense your consternation, Son of Hades, as you look about this space; you have another question, and are free to ask.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Oh, it's just... I sometimes wonder, Master Chaos... if you created all of this, then... who created you? What was this place before you arrived?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All of this simply came to be, and so did I, presumably after a former time had finally reached its end. I hesitate to say it was an act of will. It was more like a sudden shift, as when a conflagration happens from a spark. I arrived at such a time, and all else then arrived, from me.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"When you expire, and then suddenly return to life within your father's residence, perhaps it is akin to when I first gained consciousness so long ago. Perhaps I, too, had just expired, only to reawaken.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You may have wondered, Son of Hades, how it is you came to find me in this space, when I have gone unseen by most for quite some time. I have wondered this, as well, and think that our connection to Goddess Nyx is the most likely answer.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Son of Hades, I believe I have deduced something I ought have sooner recognized. Your mother must have been one who called herself Persephone. Her stay within the Underworld was brief, from my perspective, but impactful, nonetheless. You seek her now? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I do. She's somewhere on the surface. That's why I keep on finding you like this. I'm trying to find her.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I hope that your attempts achieve success. She is beyond my senses, presently, though of course I am still able to assist you in your journey, thus.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Son of Hades, I believe I have deduced something I ought have sooner recognized. Your mother must have been one who called herself Persephone. Her stay within the Underworld was brief, from my perspective, but impactful, nonetheless. You seek her now? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Oh, Master Chaos... you should know I have located her, already. Though where she is, I cannot stay for long. So I am visiting, as often as I can. It's... not unlike our visits here. Only, somehow, even harder to get to where she is.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I see. Then, it is good to know that you have been in contact. And I trust that your successive visits shall be worth their while. Not unlike our visits here.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Son of Hades, if you locate the one who called herself Persephone, shall it then come to pass that we no longer see each other in this way? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Oh! I... Master Chaos, I don't know what to expect from there. But, to be direct with you, if I could leave the Underworld forever... I think I would. Though, I would miss you. Many others here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...I would miss you as well. Thank you for telling me.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Tell me something, Son of Hades. If the one who called herself Persephone is back, then... why do you continue to return? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Master Chaos, it seems I've developed something of a talent around breaking out of here. Or, there, I mean, the Underworld, so... it's become more of an official role for me, I guess. If escape shouldn't be possible, then someone needs to find the gaps.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Indeed. Then, you shall visit with me still, despite accomplishing the principal object of your journey back when first we met. Good.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I am impressed that you were able to procure a specimen out from the flowing currents here in my domain, with nothing but a simple instrument. I shall look forward to your subsequent attempts.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I trust the small round catalyst which I provided you has been of value, Son of Hades? It is my hope it makes your journeys to this space less difficult, perhaps inducing them on a more frequent interval.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You have arrived within a certain shroud of darkness, Son of Hades. The goddess Nyx's ancient shawl. I had not sensed its void in a considerable amount of time.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You have traveled recently beyond my senses, Son of Hades. I persist here only in the fathomless depths. I know what lies out there, having created it. But I know nothing of what it is like, right now. Do not tell me. I prefer to think of all the possibilities.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"From the rumblings of the earth, I have deduced your father, himself, stands against you when at last you are about to leave these depths. It must be quite an interaction between you. Have I deduced correctly? Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"That's right, Master Chaos. My father personally takes it upon himself to stop me in the event none of his underlings beat him to it. He... can be a handful.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, then. Consider bringing to one of your future interactions the small round catalyst, which I provided you. The one in the shape you call an egg? It shall serve no purpose there at all. Yet if you succeed, then it shall bring us some amusement, shall it not?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"It seems to me that you are very close to death, O Son of Hades, and yet you deigned to visit me within my space. I could hasten your demise, if you so choose?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I almost did not notice you, O Son of Hades, for you are closer now to death than life. Perhaps, though, we can stave off the inevitable for a little while.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Your deaths are but a temporary setback, Son of Hades. Though it appears to me you are quite close to having such a setback, now.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Your next experience with death seems to be imminent, though let us see if I can hasten or forestall it.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"It may seem cruel that I would wish you death, O Son of Hades. But from my perspective, it means you are much more likely to return to me.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Although you may succumb soon to your injuries, please make the most of your remaining life, rather than anticipate the next. The future is uncertain to all save the Fates.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You come to my domain bearing an all-seeing artifact that sprang from me after the dawn of time. It is considered a defensive instrument, I do believe. Though, I suspect you have discovered, or soon shall discover, it is nothing of the sort.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I expected your arrival, Son of Hades. For I am able to see through you. Rather, through the all-seeing artifact, which sprang from me after the dawn of time, and now resembles, in your hands, its foremost form. Respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"What, you must mean the Shield of Chaos, here? Your shield, Master Chaos, I should say. It's a remarkable artifact. Imposing, too! Your original creations must have been astounding.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Your response is acceptable. And I am grateful to have had my recent firsthand glimpses of this vast domain.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Ah, you have that all-seeing artifact of mine, but in the old guise that the great Lord Zeus once used when he retaliated violently against his parentage. I watched his movements through it for some time.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I bear a message for you, Son of Hades. One recorded in an age when certain concepts it describes did not yet all exist. Remember this: I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame. A waking-phrase, to which you and the all-seeing artifact of my creation may respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"A waking-phrase... and an all-seeing artifact, you must mean Aegis, right? So I'm to say to it, I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame, and it'll wake right up. Though, can you tell me what it means, or who?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I can tell you almost anything. However, I would much prefer it if you learned most of the answers you seek by yourself.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"This is not someone I recognize... so, in the name of Hades! Erm, hello? May I ask who's calling?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...The Olympians have all grown soft... would you not agree?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Erm... have we met?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, we have met, in a way. I know everybody, here, and there. You wish to leave this place? Then, it is my wish to make your doing so a little bit more interesting... and, if you encounter the Olympians someday, do give them my regards.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I sensed a certain rumbling here within the bowels of the earth. It is as though it had ingested something that did not sit well... perhaps the earth itself wishes to spit you up and out...?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The Olympians are vying for your favor, are they not? So often they forget themselves. They force their blessings onto you, whilst I? I merely offer you a choice.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Your path is yours to shape as you see fit, regardless of the Fates' design. Together we may twist that path a bit, if you would like.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I both expected you to come and am surprised to see you, Son of Hades. Where shall your journey take you from this point?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Please tell me how my power over all existence may be of small assistance to you this time, Son of Hades?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The tremors underneath the earth foretold of your arrival at this very moment, Son of Hades; and, I have anticipated it.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You chose to visit me again within these darkest reaches of the earth, as I, in turn, now choose to offer you the means to alter your reality.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Back when I conceived the world and the immortals, Son of Hades, I did not expect you would be standing here before me now.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You have arrived at last, just as I wondered how we might best alter one another's courses of existence here today.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Son of Hades, let me welcome your return here to my space within the Underworld, and bid you choose an alteration to the fabric of reality.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"It pleases me that you are here again; for, through you I can tinker with reality, along the fringes that are not yet fully formed.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Your presence never ceases to intrigue me, Son of Hades; for you are not like the Olympians on high, who have forgotten me, or thusly choose to act.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"From my perspective I have summoned you, whilst you believe you came of your volition; both statements can be true, is that not so?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Come forth, O Son of Hades, and together, let us sow my namesake through the depths of what your father thinks his own domain.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"How fares these days the never-ending cycle of rebirth and death for you, O Son of Hades? Sufficiently amusing, I should hope?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Out of the infinitely spanning possibilities before us, Son of Hades, I have arbitrarily selected only three again from which to let you choose.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The Fates have much in store for you, O Son of Hades. Perhaps, however, we can tamper with their weavings here to some extent.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Let us conspire to expand and frustrate your lord father's sense of both what is and is not possible within his Underworld.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Infinite possibilities can be tedious to choose from, so, let me provide you with a significantly smaller set with which you may yet change the Fates' designs.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Through the expanse of time, I often wondered, is it necessary to be fair? The immortals are my offspring; surely I should treat them equally. And yet I find that there is little sport in doing so.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Among infinite possibilities, consider only these.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Choose carefully, in general, and now.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"We are the sum of all decisions that we make, and that are made for us.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
This space grows far more interesting when you occupy a small amount of it.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
How you evaluate decisions is of limitless interest to me.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
The burden of the passing time shall force a choice from you.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Is there not pleasure in determining an outcome, Son of Hades?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"My mark be with you, Son of Hades. You need merely choose its shape.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Though the waters of the Styx may wash away my mark, I can restore it.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The rhythm of your visits here over the course of time is pleasant, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You are already back, and you are always welcome, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Please visit me as frequently as you would like or dare.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I find myself anticipating your arrivals, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I require no exchange of words with you. Merely a choice.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Once more you have returned to my domain.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I have a proposition, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I bid you welcome here within my space.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
How fares the solitary Son of Hades?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"What shall we do for one another, Son of Hades?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You are within my presence, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
What brings you here to me this time around?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Your such visits are agreeable with me.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
How may the force of Chaos alter you?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
You have arrived before me once again.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I see that you are here, and so am I.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"You stand before me, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
How shall we alter the intentions of the Fates?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"How might I mend the fabric of existence for you, Son of Hades?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
There need not be a reason for your visit.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
How may I shape reality for you?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
You are always welcome here within this space.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
What occupies your mind at this occasion?,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Let us consider certain possibilities.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Among infinite outcomes, I propose these three.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Choose how to circumvent the Fates' design.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Hail, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I am amused to see you once again.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
You have descended to my space once more.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
You have returned to me.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
You are most welcome here.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Your presence is appreciated, Son of Hades, but please leave us here, for now.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Forgive us, Son of Hades, as we are amid exchanging memories.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Son of Hades, I am pleased the goddess Nyx returned to me.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Forgive me, Son of Hades, but I must continue this discussion with the goddess Nyx.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I had not seen the goddess Nyx in quite some time.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I am quite unaccustomed to having all this company of late.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
My daughter was just in the midst of telling me the latest occurrences about your House.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"As you are able to observe, the goddess Nyx and I are in the midst of conversation now.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Perhaps you did not think that I would seek you out among the boatman Charon's trifles, which precisely is the reason I have done it.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"The boatman Charon understands my whims, and his loyalty is purchased easily by one for whom base wealth is meaningless, so, I am here.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Master Chaos? Everyone makes offerings to my relatives upon Olympus. I wish to make an offering to you. Thank you for... everything.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How droll of you to make attempts to tempt me with material things. Here, then, please in turn allow me this attempt at reciprocity.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"This is for you, Master Chaos. Everyone beneath the heavens and earth enjoys this stuff.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You honor me in making such an offering, though please; it is not necessary to endear yourself using material means, for it is the thought alone which counts.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Master Chaos, forebear of the gods, it is an honor to have met you. Please, accept this gift.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Seldom do mortals or immortals think of making offerings to me. As I do not expect such token gestures, I am very much amused, and I accept.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Master Chaos, I pledge never to forget you or your good graces. May your wisdom and your whim forever guide me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Is this an offering of fealty or friendship, Son of Hades? I do not wish to know from you the answer, so that I might dwell on it and all the possibilities.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"I'm ever-grateful that my journeys through the Underworld mean that we can get to know each other, Master Chaos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your repeated generosity with me is starting to become a bit predictable, and yet... somehow, I nonetheless appreciate it, still. How very odd.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Master Chaos, it's little wonder all existence sprang from you, because I see the noble qualities in so many I've met embodied in you. Please, accept this gift.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If it is unclear yet, Son of Hades, I shall not be giving more to you in exchange for your repeated offerings. You give them to me knowing it shall serve no purpose and achieve no end. I know that there are some among both mortals and your kind for whom this is quite unacceptable.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"This is the greatest delicacy of Olympus, Master Chaos. It's for you. I think normally it would be difficult for the Olympians to get it to you here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You make an even greater offering to me, knowing it shall produce no material result. You are aware that I am not persuadable? Yours is a squandering of resources and time. Although, of course, we do have each of these in great supply. Now then, respond.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"...I just think the act of giving isn't quite the same as an exchange. I know I won't be getting any sort of other talisman or something in return. But, through these offerings, I can express my thanks. That's worth it by itself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I see. So then, the action is akin to theft. For you are getting something in return that I did not intend to give. I still have much to learn from my creations, Son of Hades. So let us say that we have made an even trade. My learning for your worth.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"If you'll forgive me, Master Chaos, this Ambrosia is intended to be given to those whom I care about, and I can think of few recipients I'd like to have it more. Please.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I shall accept this, as a final offering, O Son of Hades. For I have given it additional consideration, and decided that my previous analysis of your intentions was too narrow, too inaccurate. And, I regret comparing what you have been doing to an act of theft. Respond?",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Don't even mention it, please, Master Chaos. All of this is new for me, as well. I try never to overanalyze... my father does enough of that for all of us. I just know, when I encounter the primordial creator, I am going to give thanks. For everything.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I see. Then, your response is quite acceptable. And, since the act of giving is not an exchange, let us say that you already had my gratitude.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Master Chaos, thank you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This was one of the potential outcomes of my gift.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
All of this was in accordance with the Fates' design; or perhaps not.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
I expected you would perish soon; but I knew not exactly how.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
Your demises are unfortunate and yet a source of some amusement.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
"Be careful with me, Son of Hades.",CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
That was perhaps unwise.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
You have provided me amusement.,CHARACTER,Chaos,genderless
The power of the gods.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Time to tune up this sword.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Now to fix up this spear.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This spear's due for a little maintenance.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should get this bow back into tiptop shape.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This bow could use a little fine tuning.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should put some extra punch into this shield.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This shield's about to get a whole lot stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
New styles for the Twin Fists.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Time to fix up these Fists.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Secrets of the Twin Fists...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Good as new.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Feels lighter than before.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Need all the firepower I can get.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That should do it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanks, Daedalus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Done and done.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Daedalus power.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

My blade grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Coronacht grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The deadliest bow of all.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's go, Coronacht.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My bow grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Quite the bow.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Drawn tight.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Varatha grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
They'll fear me with this spear.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's go, Varatha.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My spear grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Extra pointy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Aegis grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Never been a finer shield.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's go, Aegis.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My shield grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Not too heavy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nice and sturdy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
These Fists are hungry to fight.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Malphon grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That feels better.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Better get cracking.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Perfect fit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Exagryph grows stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Beware the adamant rail.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

You... why...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Stupid boy. I told you nobody gets out of here, whether alive or dead. Though, how was your wanton ransacking of my domain?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Greetings, Father. My ransacking was a delight, thank you for asking. So, I'll just be on my way, again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Be on your way, indeed. What do I care? You shall never reach the surface. Go, see for yourself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What is it, now? I've a mountain of infernal parchmentwork.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Out of my sight, now, go.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
No thanks!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"To what do I owe the pleasure, boy? For I'm unaccustomed to being approached by you here in my House.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, you know. Just thought I'd check in, see what you were up to. Parchmentwork going all right, I'm sure?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh yes, the parchmentwork is going splendidly. Would you care for some? There is no shortage of it, you see.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Father, what happened to the lounge? The only place for anyone to have a little fun around here, and you seal it shut.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I had little choice about that, boy. You see, after you fled the first time, Cerberus, why he was very much upset. Utterly tore the place to shreds. It's now under repair. All thanks to you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're really blaming me for not minding the dog while I was out, and while you all were here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusExpressiveEmpathy,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I lay the blame entirely upon you, yes. Who else? It's fortunate that Cerberus has calmed himself since then! Come to his senses, I should say. May you yet come to yours.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nice.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Who's that sniveling shade to your immediate left, there, Father? Already found someone new to do the busywork. And here I thought I was utterly indispensable.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That shade, boy, is my newly designated contractor; one whose responsibility is to work on this House. Though, who shall pay for everything my subjects here demand, I do not know.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're trying to guilt me into funding the exorbitant furnishings you desire.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perhaps once we are finished with repairs for all the carnage you have sown throughout my realm, then we might finally have time for all the needed renovations that have piled up.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You have been keeping our contractor rather busy, I must say. Commissioning these frivolous projects around the House with the wealth you wrest from my domain. What are you hoping to achieve?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, you know, just giving back to the community. Figure if I'm to keep getting dragged back here it might as well be somewhat livable.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Livable! When last I checked, making the Underworld livable was not among our top priorities. Just remember, in your brazenness, whose House this is.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hrm.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You have been keeping our contractor rather busy, I must say. Commissioning these frivolous projects around the House with the wealth you wrest from my domain. What are you hoping to achieve?",CHARACTER,Hades,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hrm.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go occupy yourself someplace else.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"There's quite a lot of renovating to be done, isn't there, Father. Your House Contractor there has shown a wide variety of pending jobs.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've ordered Nyx to supervise that list. Entirely her problem, boy. And likely yours. How does it feel, knowing that your rampages create the need for so much maintenance?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Feels pretty good, now that you mention it. Keeps everybody occupied, no?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, Father! I must say ransacking your domain beats having to toil endlessly in the administrative chamber. Far less painful, really.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah! Is that your way of asking me for your old job back, boy? You were a scourge upon every administrative duty to which you were assigned.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Yes, please, Father, give me back my old, wretched job, won't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Privileges are earned not begged for, boy. Unless you plan to reimburse this House for all the income that we lost because of you, then you shall not so much as set foot in the administrative chamber, again.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How much is the reimbursement fee, anyway?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whichever exorbitant amount the House Contractor has on record, now leave me be!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So help me, boy, I cannot fathom why you would have bought back the authority to enter the administrative chamber once again.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I knew you thought I'd never do it under any circumstances, Father. That seemed reason enough. Though, fear not, I've no plans to reapply for a position there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That does alleviate a deeply rooted fear of mine, in fact. The scene you caused in your brief time there yet remains a widely talked-about event among the shades who toil for me still.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're better off.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Always wanted to ask you something, Father. Whose skull is that there on your shoulder? If it's not too personal.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I did not chronicle all Typhon's wretched offspring, boy. No one did. Some of them sit upon our shoulders now, lest we forget that things could easily have turned out rather differently, and much, much worse.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So these are just the remains of the spawn of the most hideous monstrosity of all time, which you and your brothers slew, got it. I guess putting the dead in their place is all part of the job. I can hardly imagine what it was like before you and the Olympians took charge.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Indeed.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Be certain that you take appropriate precautions with the Sigil of the Dead that you now bear. Should some misfortune come to it through negligence, it cannot be replaced.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I can't imagine what I'd do without your blessing, Father! But, thank you again. I don't often inherit Fate-appointed honors, and will take good care of it. Though... what if the Olympians catch on? Wouldn't do for everybody knowing that you're aiding me even a little, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Correct. It would not do, at all. Fortunately, the power of the Unseen can remain well-hidden as it pleases. What is it your instructor always says?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...Fear is for the weak?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Those Chthonic Companion things you have from Nyx, or whoever they ended up with... I know they have been benefiting you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Yeah, well... I'm to attempt to escape this place by any means necessary, right? I figure if I can call on Olympus for aid, maybe some of my friends can help me in a pinch, as well.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not what I mean. Some of your friends have been reluctant to engage against me during our scuffles on the surface. Know that I have authorized them to proceed, if necessary.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Wait, really? You're saying it's OK for your own loyal subjects to side against you up there? You won't take it out on them?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I consider it an expansion of their responsibilities. Now, go.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
See to it. And... well done.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So tell me, Father. Just how much did it hurt your soul knowing my face is up there on the Featured Houseservant Board, for all in the lounge to see?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Has it occurred to you that I, alone, have final say about whose countenance is shown up there? Although, others who shall not be named did put in a good word for you, repeatedly.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blood and darkness... all my life I thought that board was a joke. But seeing my face up there... it felt good. Thanks, Father. Maybe it won't be the last time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Indulge me for a moment, boy. Why bother to construct a sundial, there? Knowing full well it was my wish to have one installed. To demonstrate your awe-inspiring authority? Or to deny me the small pleasure of doing it myself?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Maybe a little of each? Or maybe you ought not second-guess my every motive and decision, constantly, searching for some sinister agenda that has yet to cross my mind?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Pah! I would have chosen an entirely different marble texture for it, anyway.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, it's no trouble at all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Guess what, Father? The lounge is all tidied up. Your House Contractor there is quite efficient once you muster up the necessary funds. You should try it sometime!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Are you expecting words of thanks because you paid the contractor to fix a bit of devastation that you caused? I fear it shall take rather more than that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What if I replaced every furnishing in this blasted place, would you treat me any better then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I suppose, boy, that there's only one way to find out. Though I suggest you save yourself the trouble.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Good talk...? Good talk..,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I see you've decided to come home. Changed your mind yet, or looking for more pain and suffering?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"More pain and suffering, for sure. After all, you taught me to appreciate the finer things.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You keep telling yourself that, boy. But, mark you my words, sooner or later, this life that you have chosen for yourself shall teach you I was right.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
ZagreusTalkDenialReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well that was quick. What news, boy, ready to give up, or no?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'd like that, wouldn't you? Lucky I've got other family who believe in me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Be careful whom you give your trust. My brothers frolic on Olympus while we work. While I work! You're just like them. No wonder they like you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

"Father, everybody's dead. Give them a break.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What would you even know of honest work? At least the wretched dead yet honor me as Lord. I cannot say the same for you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Have you yet satisfied your foolish urges? Perhaps a lashing from the Furies' whips would set you straight.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I had it out with them already, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Such nonsense. First you defy me openly, and now you lie. On my next meeting with the Furies, we'll have a word about all this, you rest assured.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why, I can scarce believe my eyes, is that you, boy?! Cerberus, look who it is, he's back!",CHARACTER,Hades,male

"He's back already, Cerberus! Just as I indicated.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I'm standing right here, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sorry he disturbed your rest again, Cerberus, you've done a good job. The realm is well defended still, to the high standard that you set.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What did I tell you, boy? Ever wasteful of your time, and mine. How fares my Underworld, hm?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I don't know how you can stand it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, at least some things are running smoothly still. Next you go to die again, do give the tortured souls out there my warm regards.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ah, for shame, boy. I thought perhaps you'd finally made it out.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Really...? I mean, oh, wait, you're not serious. That famous sense of humor shining through.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I jest, of course, you'll never make it out; as I keep telling you to no avail. But you've gone farther than expected. So, who knows....",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...You've been gone a while...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'm going to find Mother. No matter how long it takes me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"For the last time, you're not to speak about that woman in my House. You want to know of her so much, you go find her, indeed.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Pleasure doing business, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I know that Nyx has been abetting you. You wish to take advantage of her pity? I care not. Her powers have their limits, anyway.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How can you... Nyx is the Night Itself, and can do as she pleases, isn't that correct, Father? You think I asked she get involved in all this business?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You, boy, have already dragged this entire household, not to mention my fool relatives, into this mess, which you've created. Which you dare call business.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Heartwarming.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, tell me something, Father, if you please. Since we're more candid lately in regard to matters of my birthright here, and all... did you and Mother... how to put this? Any brothers or sisters I should know about?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I thought I told you never to invoke her here! Be thankful that you have no blasted kin. You've such weak blood, and such a temperament... why, then, would you think I'd risk another, such as you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Sure, that's fair enough, it's just not all such things occur as planned, as I am told. From tales of your brothers and so forth.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, blast my brothers, and blast you, as well! All those who know me know I have no heir. You could not rise to the occasion if you tried! And, there is no one else. You've only me. And I have only you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Contractor, mind locating the Court Musician's Sentence when you get the chance?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You call my chambers a mess, look at your desk, Father! Whatever happened to your court musician, huh, where's his sentencing parchmentwork? Stuck in Tartarus, all because he stopped singing for you on command?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My desk is far more organized than you, boy! And if you're so concerned about our court musician, why don't you commute his sentence, yourself? Seeing as I haven't gotten around to it yet.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Sure, happy to oblige. I'll just ask the House Contractor since you're too busy.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Your methods didn't seem to do the trick.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I understand you have attempted to persuade our court musician to resume his craft. That is among the relatively useful tasks to which you have applied yourself of late.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I can't be completely sure but, what you said just now I think contained some of the component pieces of a compliment?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm certain that your boasts and twists of words shall soon inspire him to greater acts of compositional superiority, one of these days or nights.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...I hope.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I had a feeling that our court musician would eventually come back to his senses and his talents, boy. Here, yet again, my intuitions were correct. Though, you appear a bit perturbed. Don't like the song? It's about you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It says I'm really the bastard son of Zeus, but also indelibly connected to the god of wine, and how your parents tore me to pieces, giving rise to mortals, but that I'm always going to be stuck here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You fill Orpheus' mind with nonsense, he produces nonsense. Nonsense I presume shall spread from this place far and wide, so everyone might know that I have nothing to do with you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'm not worried. Orpheus plays for a very small audience.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Tsch.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, I met an oak nymph called Eurydice. You know her name, I think. Is it really true what happened between her and Orpheus? They say you almost let her out, so why not me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Pah! Orpheus is a talented musician, and a fool. I knew he would never get his beloved wife out of here. There's no escape for her, or anyone, including you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
So you tricked him. Or maybe offered him a deal in bad faith. No matter. What's it going to take to waive the separation order between them?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's non-negotiable, boy. Waiving a separation order! That's a veritable fortune in dues alone. Off the table. Now, go mind your own affairs, and leave the waiving and the ordering to me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Who knows, they might surprise you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, have you ever considered that Orpheus might be much better as a court musician if you permitted him to see his muse again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have considered many possibilities, boy. And I trust Orpheus considered many possibilities before he signed away his rights to see his so-called muse when once he invaded my realm!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
So you're forcing him to stay here for eternity just because he signed a contract with you?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Contracts with me are binding! Until such time as they dig themselves out of the archives and tear themselves up! And I don't see that happening anytime soon.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We'll see.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, let's say, hypothetically, that I could pay the dues to waive the separation order between Orpheus and Eurydice. Would you honor the new terms, or spitefully cheat me out of a fair deal?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I honor the terms of my commitments, boy. The rules we put in place are all that keep this Underworld in any semblance of a shape! But, what you ask is utterly absurd. The costs of processing a separation order are well beyond your means.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Looking forward to it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You voided the contract with our court musician. Used your own authority against me.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So what if I did? Just gives him a bit of break from time to time. He's still your court musician, isn't he?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He is. And he knows better than to undermine me, I think. Out with you, then! I'll deal with your insubordination some other time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
He has.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You voided the contract with our court musician. Used your own authority against me.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So what if I did? Just gives him a bit of break from time to time. He's still your court musician, isn't he?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He is. And he knows better than to undermine me, I think. Though, I suppose the Queen would take your side that he has paid his dues in full, by now...?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That's good to know!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, let me ask you something work-related, here. I know the shade called Sisyphus once wronged both you and Thanatos, and has since paid a heavy price. But don't the Fury Sisters now have better things to do than torture him?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You come to me to question how I allocate my resources? Preposterous. I care nothing for that wretched shade. That he is tortured for eternity is but a technicality resulting from his arrogance. The terms of his incarceration are long lost!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So then if I could somehow find those terms, then theoretically, I could grant him a pardon...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you could somehow do your job, and enact miracles, then yes! You could do anything, then, I suppose. Including waste your time on those of his undeserving ilk.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Not if those responsibilities matter.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You altered one of my own pacts, without so much as seeking my consent... undoing terms that were agreed upon. Do you intend to undermine everything in this House, boy? Or only me?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Only you, Father. Good thing I've inherited some of your Fate-given authority, being your son and all. Otherwise some of your most loyal subjects would be bound by exploitive terms for eternity.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Terms that they chose, themselves! Terms to the benefit of this House. What if Achilles were to leave his post for the green pastures of Elysium, what then?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You could find a replacement? But it's a pointless question anyway, because he's here! He isn't leaving. He might even do better at his job, now that he has increased ability to step away from it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A naive hope, at best. The more you step away from your responsibilities, the less you shall want anything to do with them.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That's strangely comforting to know.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Megaera tells me that you surpassed her while out there. How utterly embarrassing for her, to say the least.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I suppose you're going to punish her in some cruel fashion, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I've already seen to that, of course. You think she volunteered to deal with you? Nobody did. That's how ignoble a task it is.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Looking forward to it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tell me something, boy, did you enjoy the searing heat of Asphodel? You must have thought that you'd be more resilient to it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'm open to a change of climate. Even if it gets a bit uncomfortable.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know nothing of discomfort, yet. Making it out of Tartarus is nothing in comparison to what lies ahead for you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
ZagreusTalkDenialReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You'll find out soon enough.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I understand that you created quite a stir within Elysium. An all-out brawl within eternal paradise!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You call that paradise? It's just a bunch of shades bored out of their former skulls, itching for a chance to feel alive again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

What would you know of it! The greatest mortals have their every need fulfilled within that place. I dread to hear what they shall say of all of this.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"See you up at the Temple then, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tell me something, boy, because my own set of ideas on the subject is beginning to run dry: What, exactly, is it going to take for you to understand that you're not leaving here?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Perhaps you ought to have me bound next to Prometheus, and have the dreaded Eagle peck my liver for eternity?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You would have me resort to such barbarity? Blast you, boy. Punishment is not the path to rehabilitation; it is for its own sake. I'd have expected all your trips through Tartarus to have taught you as much.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
And there it is again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm truly sorry that he's troubled you again, Cerberus. I know how much you value resting here, and yet, I have no better means to bar the entry to our realm than you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I thought you'd figured out by now that guilting me into abandoning my quest won't work. You're the one who should feel guilty, forcing Cerberus to block my path.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What would you know of it? Cerberus cannot be forced to do anything. He simply understands he has responsibilities.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
No!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, verify something for me, here, boy. According to the latest reports... you attempted unsuccessfully to shoplift from Charon, himself? And were consequently slain? Utterly ignoble end, even for you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Erm, I was borrowing, OK? Not shoplifting. Why didn't anybody ever tell me Charon was such a monster? I thought the boating mercantile thing made for a peaceful life.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You incur the wrath of ancient chthonic gods, and then are surprised to be destroyed by them? Have you learned nothing, after all this time?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Sounds good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How are you finding my old trusty spear, then, hm? Or perhaps you have a preference for my brothers' and my sisters' former arms. Kept under lock and key, and yet, they're now in your possession, it would seem.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The weapons in the courtyard. Of course you know about them, by now. I stole them. Why not just take them from me? I'd be stuck.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The thought has long since crossed my mind. However, I'm not fool enough to tamper with those cursed things. They go where they please. They cannot be contained. Like you. Now, why don't you go entertain each other more?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Didn't think things could get any more awkward with her.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Megaera and her sisters ganged up on me that time. I didn't think anyone could talk her into working with Alecto and Tisiphone again. Or even be in the same chamber.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can be quite persuasive under certain circumstances, boy. Though my advice to you, not that you'll take it, is not to discuss the matter openly. Megaera is a professional; but she has made her feelings on the matter clear.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Pushovers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It is woefully infrequent that I've cause for this, but I do have to thank you, boy. You've culled the Satyrs and the vermin bringing ruin to our Temple, there! Blasted creatures multiply at an alarming rate.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"They're not doing your bidding, yet they're every bit as bothersome as all your wretched servants I've met. I'm surprised you aren't getting along.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They are a plague upon this realm, although we have them well contained, for now. And once they are rightly dead, they tend to swear to me their fealty.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're right. I don't.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, you always said the Olympians wanted nothing to do with our kind. But doesn't Charon work directly with Hermes? Maybe it's you who wants nothing to do with them.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I want nothing to do with them, correct. My hasty nephew assists Charon out of necessity, alone. Not even Thanatos is able to keep up with the rate at which mortals expire and must then cross our borders.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Want me to pitch in? Just give me your blessing and I'll head straight for the surface.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahaha, no. I think not, boy. You are born of this realm. The surface is a wind-swept waste. You don't know how good you have it here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseWryLaughToGlaring,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sorry, Father. I'm not afraid of you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"She is gone, boy. She is gone. You are never going to locate her. I thought you would have come to that conclusion for yourself, by now. But apparently it must be said.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You mean Mother. How would you even know? You said reaching the surface was impossible as well, and I'm in striking distance.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is my final warning to you, boy... to cease this mindless quest. Or else, the consequences shall be worse than what you have experienced thus far.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Works for me!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whatever you did to my blasted seat is of no consequence to me. From my vantage-point, I can't even see it! A foolish prank and waste of valuable resources, nothing more.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It's more for everybody else than you, Father. Think of it as a tribute to Cerberus! Besides, you really should think about changing up the look of this place from time to time. Keep things fresh!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The limitless work keeps things fresh enough as it is. Though if making aimless changes in this House is how you choose to spend your limitless time, I'll have no part of it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I figured.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, of all the skeletons and such in your direct employ... you wouldn't happen to have any here around the House, would you? Out in my courtyard, for example?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Skeletons! I'm sure they'll welcome you when next you visit Asphodel. You may not realize it, boy, but we have a certain standard of decency we uphold around here!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
That's certainly a way of looking at it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You ever think of giving Thanatos a break, Father? He seems to have more than his fair share of work of late.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Blame the blasted mortals for perishing so easily, or blame Lord Ares, prior to accusing me. With their surface wars, not only do they kill each other readily, but also often subsequently perish from the consequences of it all!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What wars, what's going on up there? Why don't the other Olympians do something?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Pah! How should I know? The mortals are equipped to settle their petty differences by any number of means. We have to make room for them all sooner or later, regardless.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So, you had a run-in with the Minotaur out in Elysium, did you? Perhaps the only soul within this realm more bull-headed than you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How long have you been waiting to use that line, Father? Wouldn't put it past you to have sent the Bull of Minos to Elysium entirely so we could have this conversation now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You give me too much credit, boy. The Minotaur resides where he resides because of an entirely different arrangement.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"He's working for you, isn't he? You think he can stop me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Most in Elysium jump at the opportunity to do my bidding. Not that you know what that is like. Now go, see how you fare against the bull.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
They should have asked the expert I suppose.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How goes your heated rivalry against the greatest king of Athens lately, boy? Your battles with him and the Minotaur must be the talk of the Underworld of late.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Admit it, Father. Theseus was the only hero you were able to recruit to stand against me. All the while he gets to boast about being the champion. What, was Heracles too busy for the task?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Speak not to me of Heracles. You know these heroes by their deeds, not by their character. Heracles is fortunate he's in my brother's favor. Else he would be in Tartarus where he belongs. The mortal concept of what constitutes a hero is absurd.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
My pleasure.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I know what you did. Stay out of Nyx's affairs next time, boy. She is needed here! Not wallowing in the primordial dark.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're just angry because some of us still want to have anything to do with their parents.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Parents, pah! You know nothing of what parents are capable of. Conspire all you like against my wishes, I care not. Get out.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So you were able to dispatch my Hydra, boy. Right down to the last hateful head. It's an accomplishment I felt was certainly beyond your talent set. Though, here you are again, nevertheless.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You cheated me. There wasn't anywhere that I could go! I could have gone much farther. All the way to Mother!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You shall do no such thing. Besides, if you were any help to me, you'd know vast portions of my realm are presently still under renovation. You won't be getting farther than you have.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
ZagreusTalkDenialReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I can wait. You can't just keep this place on lockdown for eternity. The mortals up there wouldn't stand for it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They have no patience, yes. The same as you. Then wait, with all the rest of them. It matters not to me. For I have other work to do.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now you begone from here, get yourself killed some more for all I care.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, boy. Word has reached me that you were able to dethrone the Champion of Elysium as well as his bull-headed companion. Tell me, how did you accomplish such a thing?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"First, you tell me when I can get out of there. The path guarded by Theseus was sealed! Is there even a surface? Is the outside world all a lie?!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, now you are asking the big questions! Comforting to see such growth of character. Well if there is an outside world, you shall not be seeing it for quite some time. You know why, don't you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Ongoing Underworld renovations?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ongoing Underworld renovations. Now go and let King Theseus drive that sharp spear of his into yourself some more, until such time. The mortals soon shall force me to reopen, and then what?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Now you begone from here, get yourself killed some more for all I care.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You are late, boy! Have you any idea what time it is?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No. Wait, what? I just vanquished you in single combat, and that's all you have to say to me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Vanquished me? Hah, hahaha, nonsense. Don't you think I would recall such an event?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You can't be serious. You're going to pretend as though it never happened?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Everything is as it always was. And so shall it be, until the Fates determine otherwise. Or until our ongoing Underworld renovations are finally complete. Whichever comes first.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Excellent, can't wait!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So you're really not going to answer my question about Mother from the other time, until the Underworld renovations are complete?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know not what you're going on about, there, boy. Although, my focus is entirely upon our renovations, yes. Perhaps someday or night when this place is in proper working order, I shall have more time for your insipid questions.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I know where we can continue this discussion, then...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You are late, boy! Have you any idea what time it is?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"No. Wait, what? I vanquished you in single combat and finally found Mother, and that's all you have to say to me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah, haha! Nonsense. Don't you think I would recall such an event?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseWryLaughToGlaring,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You can't be serious. You're going to pretend as though it never happened? She wants answers, same as I do. She demands you let me pass! Let me go to her again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Silence! This discussion is over. I hardly think this is the time or place to indulge your overwrought imagination.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
No! I'll hear no demands from you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I told you, boy. I told you! There's no escape from here. Learned that the hard way, then?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You could have told me more important things. Mother left because she never even knew I was alive. Thanks to you! She's got a lot of questions, herself, as you can probably imagine. I'm headed back to her. You going to cooperate?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahaha, nonsense! Listen to me: If you have any sense remaining in that head of yours, I caution you not to discuss this here and now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseWryLaughToGlaring,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Let me go. Let me find her. She demands it!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Count on that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Quite a mess you've created, I must say, Father... after being of no help whatsoever when it comes to disentangling it all. Though, this isn't the place to talk, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No! It most certainly is not. Though, I take it it shall not be long before another of our private meetings, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Until such place and time, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Something the matter, there, Father? You seem a little quieter than usual. Dare I say even a little somber and remorseful, for some reason?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Silence, boy! And better yet, why don't you get out of my sight? I've more important things to do now than indulge your boastfulness. We'll have to catch up at some other place and time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, I'm certain I shall figure something out.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You know, Father, while I'm sure you don't appreciate all the distractions as of late, your ceaseless toil has had some noticeable effect. Is it my imagination, or are the ongoing Underworld renovations almost complete?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There you go, getting ahead of yourself, again. The final stages of renovation are some of the most vital! Second only to the initial planning. There's a great deal of important work ahead!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I wasn't saying it wasn't important, I was just saying maybe there's finally an end to it in sight. What are you going to do with all your spare time, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It's a deal.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's the giant pact posted out in the courtyard, Father? You offering me a job?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perish the thought. It's so that all your toiling can be more painful, nothing more.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why would I want my toiling to be more painful than it already is?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Who knows, boy, or better yet, who cares? To make the mortals up there worship you for all your labors? Go on, then, go get yourself dispatched some more, so I can make well certain that my realm can properly contain you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Enough. Get out.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"My records indicate that you've collected earnings based on some of your accomplishments, there, boy. I suppose you need an income of your own, having decided to cut ties and all.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What, you mean the bounties that you've offered up to anybody capable of beating Meg and all your other guardians out there? Don't you think that puts a lot of undue pressure on them, knowing that you've turned them into targets?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They must do better than they have, else they shall be replaced. If they're to grow in their respective roles, they have to know their weaknesses. And so do I. That you collect the bounties for it matters not.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What about the bounties for vanquishing you? Who's your replacement going to be?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Enough. Get out.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"My records indicate that you've collected earnings based on some of your accomplishments, there, boy. I suppose you need an income of your own, having decided to cut ties and all.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What, you mean the bounties that you've offered up to anybody capable of beating Meg and all your other guardians out there? Don't you think that puts a lot of undue pressure on them, knowing that you've turned them into targets?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They must do better than they have, else they shall be replaced. If they're to grow in their respective roles, they have to know their weaknesses. And so do I. That you collect the bounties for it matters not.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Be sure to add those to the list of words you'll eat someday.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Tsch.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Saw your new Pact of Punishment out in the courtyard, Father. Impressed that you could find a parchment large enough to fit all the unpleasant stipulations. So you're taking even harsher measures to contain me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whether you consent to the terms of the Pact is entirely up to you, boy. But, in all your comings and goings, it is important that we have full knowledge of which property is being carried from the premises.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Plenty of room for improvement...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You've taken more advantage of the Pact of Punishment than I would have expected, boy. I almost wish to commend you for doing such a thing.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Almost? I've been rampaging through the worst your realm has to offer. Causing you untold inconvenience and likely a fortune in repair costs. I thought you'd be upset.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Upset? Heavens, no. Through your repeated bumbling, you have revealed a number of shortcomings in our operations, which my underlings are busy working to address.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You know you sound especially despicable when you say underlings, don't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't let me keep you any longer, boy, go forth! Try to escape again. You're helping make the Underworld a better place.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Sure. Sorry about your Pact.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Explain to me something: How did you do it? I mean the Pact. For all of the conditions it imposed... you still surpassed me. How?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Plenty of practice, regular exercise, a positive attitude, the blessings of assorted family members you don't like, and your discarded Titan-slaying weapons I suppose. Nothing special. Why do you ask?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"To think that you would squander such a talent on frivolous pursuit. You do not even realize what you have achieved, do you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Wait, wait wait wait wait, care to repeat that first part that you said back there? The talent part?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Would that you had a talent for listening. Begone for now.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Bet I can take you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Back to your senses, then, boy? The Pact of Punishment is not something one ought to trifle with unknowingly, in case you've yet to notice.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Father... the Pact... you were so blasted strong. I had no idea! All those other times we fought... I can't believe that you were holding back. You were desperate to stop me, you could have!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We are bound by the Fates to this realm. It is ours, and we belong to it, in turn. And... I did not hold back against you. Rather... I had forgotten my old strength. Some of it since returned to me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Must have been all our vicious battles to the death? Or maybe it's from Mother being back in your life?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Pointless to even ask. What motivates us is a complicated thing. But if you long to face me with the power I once held during my own youth... you have available to you the means.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'm thinking there shall.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Urgh... come, get your gloating well out of the way, so I can get back to this parchmentwork. It piled up, in my prolonged absence!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Not here to gloat, Father. Well fought back there. I can't believe I got you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Nor I. Next time, the Fates may not decide to favor you like that. If there shall be a next time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Loud and clear.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father... look, Lord Uncle Zeus, I've been in contact with him, and he wishes to make peace. He asked for me to tell you. To tell you he forgives you for... whatever happened.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My brother Zeus... forgives me? Zeus forgives me?! How dare that blasted little brat! His beard may be luxurious but he's as much a child as are you. Forgives me, bah!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What did you do...? What happened between you?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"None of your business! Go on now and frolic with that Lord Uncle of yours, the both of them! And don't you ever speak of him to me again, you hear me?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...You can't hide the truth forever.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Question for you, Father. The name Kore happen to mean anything to you, by any chance?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, where did you...?! Ahh, the cold witch brought it up, did she? Never repeat that name again, not here, nor anywhere, you hear me, boy? Know only this: The one called by that name despised it even more than I.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So let's see. Demeter's daughter went missing. She wound up down here. I... happened. Mother left. Demeter, and everyone else on Olympus apparently, has no idea. That about right? Tell me what happened.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll tell you nothing! Keep meddling in matters that you cannot understand, and you'll incur the wrath of Olympus on all that you hold dear. And, know that it is not for my sake that I'm warning you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...I'll have to try that, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What is it now? I see that sneering look upon your countenance, which must mean you have yet another one of your insipid questions, haven't you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, this one's not insipid in the slightest. Let me get this straight. My mother's Persephone. Her mother's Demeter, but her father... evidently was some farm-boy? My red blood comes from him? And my propensity to die I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You blame your ancestors for your own weakness? You should be thankful you were born with immortality! Though, your meddlesome curiosity and constant need for affirmation must certainly be from your mortal side.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Then, Mother, did... she grow older with age? Is she just going to expire as the mortals do? With demigods I hear it can go either way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I said never to speak of her, blast you! You said, yourself, she is the daughter of the goddess of seasons! Use your fool head, for once.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...Hard to imagine.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Greetings, Father. Ran into Lady Demeter out there, on my last outing. Or should I say, my grandmother? What's she to you, then, ex-mother-in-law? Source of abject terror? Hard keeping track. Our family's rather complicated.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do not invoke her name inside my House, you hear me, boy? You do not know at all what she is like. Though I can see why you two hit it off. She hated her father. Though understandably, as he was worse even than mine. Even than yours.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I do. Your mother the Queen is working on that.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Greetings, Father. So! I can just... head on out there again whenever I want? Don't need to stick to any rigid schedule?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your unpredictability is one of your assets. Our defenses must always be on guard. So, yes: Go about your business as you best see fit!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"And the Olympians are going to keep helping me, thinking I'm trying to get away from you, to them. We can't keep this up with them forever, you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're welcome.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tell me something, boy... Zagreus... why did you do all this? Return the Queen. Go to such lengths. At a certain point... you must have learned the way I felt about her. Yet still you persisted. If I were you... I'd not have done me any favors.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I didn't often stop to give it much thought. I just knew I needed to find her... and then as soon as I did, I knew I needed her in my life. In other words, doing you any favors was never a priority, Father. Just ended up that way, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I see. I appreciate your candor. Nevertheless... I thank you. I do not know how you accomplished what you did, but know that I am grateful for the outcome. Even if I fail to act like it, much of the time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Can't wait!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Say, Father... back when you drew lots with your brothers, and wound up with the Underworld, rather than the heavens or the seas... which would you have claimed, if the choice was yours?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I do not deal in hypotheticals, boy. Each realm has its host of unenviable problems. You have never experienced the cold and sopping sea, or the blinding heights of Olympus. I have. And I assure you, you're not missing much.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Didn't you try to leave the Underworld, yourself, at some point? You once gave me that impression. I always thought it was because you hated it here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I hate not having any choice. Enjoy the freedoms that you have. As you grow long in years, you gain more burdens and responsibilities, until they bind you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Sounds like you've got it all under control.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father, all these shades... aren't they going to let on that Mother's back? What if word spreads... and the Olympians find out?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are so well-accustomed to defying me that you forget there are no others, either living or dead, who would so dare. None in this House shall speak of this until we are prepared to make any announcements, on our own terms.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Sounds great!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Regarding your responsibilities: Our Resources Director is available to you. In my private quarters. Normally, it would be I, alone, transferring excess resources back into our realm.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The fabled Resources Director! So, now I get to give away the hard-earned resources I've painstakingly gathered over time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You get to do precisely that. It is not necessary that you do. But if you wish to rise above your current station, you shall do it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What's the point in rising above my current station? I thought our work was to be done in secrecy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is. There is no point but pride. And pride is dangerous. Do what you will. I care not, as long as everything gets adequately done.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Sounds great!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Regarding your responsibilities: Our Resources Director is available to you. In the administrative chamber. Normally, it would be I, alone, transferring excess resources back into our realm.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The fabled Resources Director! So, now I get to give away the hard-earned resources I've painstakingly gathered over time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You get to do precisely that. It is not necessary that you do. But if you wish to rise above your current station, you shall do it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
What's the point in rising above my current station? I thought our work was to be done in secrecy.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is. There is no point but pride. And pride is dangerous. Do what you will. I care not, as long as everything gets adequately done.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Thank you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Briefly, now, boy: Our Resources Director informs me you've advanced in rank. Commendable. That's all.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
OK!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You are advancing through the ranks of your position, and returning to our realm the vast resources you have claimed. As well you ought. Carry on.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"We cannot speak of this, except... Unseen One... the highest ranking that we can bestow. I never once imagined that you could achieve that rank, yourself. Or any rank of note.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You always thought too little of me, Father. Though, thank you for taking note of that. I figured I ought to give back to the realm that made me what I am.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yes. For this is the only world we know.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I will... take care, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father... all this stuff with the Olympians... will you just tell me what's going on, for once? How did Mother come to join you here? What's your problem with Uncle Zeus?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I thought she already told you...! Urgh. Come with me. Now.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
...Swear to me that you shall never repeat what you are about to hear. Swear it!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"All right, all right, I swear. I swear, in your own name, I'll keep what you're about to say between us.... So?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So... you had it mostly right, before. After I inherited the Underworld... your Uncle Zeus felt sympathy for me, he says. Your mother, he knew she was unhappy on Olympus. And... he knew I was drawn to her. So what did he do? He brought her here. Gave her to me as a gift!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You weren't expecting a gift like that. But she didn't want to return to Olympus, and you liked her, so you didn't send her away. And you're angry with Zeus for putting you in that position? Cut ties with him?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes!! The blasted fool, with all his flights of fancy! He does whatever he wants! He could have achieved a similar outcome in a limitless number of reasonable ways... rather than resort to what was tantamount to kidnapping! Even if she wanted to leave!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"And now if Demeter and the others found all this out, you and Mother... even Zeus would be in a bad spot, wouldn't he? He must have a temper on him to match yours.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know nothing of tempers if mine is your frame of reference, Zagreus. Now, enough of this! You know the rest. Remember your oath.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nrgh...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"One thing, before you depart again, boy. Until the Queen's intentions with Olympus come to pass... not a word to anyone about her presence, here. Do you understand?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
I do. But she won't have to hide forever.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
The work nevertheless has to be done!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So, now that the festivities are over with, it's back to work like this, the same as ever?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do you have any idea what happens when you announce the Underworld has a Queen, boy? Urgh, damn it! Zagreus, I mean. You become inundated with well-wishes from every blasted shade that wants something.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're responding to well-wishes? Aw. Don't you think some of your subjects are sincerely happy for you?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
They are very easy to maintain!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I never stopped to think about why pomegranates grew here in the Underworld. Mother's doing from before, then? And all that stuff she told the Olympians, about how they bind you to this place... it's all nonsense?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know full well that the pomegranates in my realm hold a certain power beyond the tartness of their taste, boy. The Queen... she has a way with plants, you see. A bit of her own mother's gift, applied more sensibly.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You kept them growing all this time... flourishing, even, because of her.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, all right.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, what happened, when Mother first arrived, if I may ask? Some of your residents seem to remember the Queen from before. Yet the Olympians just never found out?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They had no jurisdiction here. No knowledge of our goings-on. Well, Hermes did, perhaps, but in a very limited capacity. As far as anybody knew beyond this realm... our Queen was Nyx. Ask nothing more of this.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Glad you're handling it fine.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Father... how are you doing without Mother around? Will she be all right, on Olympus?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Clearly she is more than capable of handling herself. And we here have been well accustomed to not having her about.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So everything's back to normal, then? That sounds lovely.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nothing is normal, anymore. Besides! She shall return. Knowing that she shall return, is that not sufficient for you? Be patient, for once.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Zagreus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...Zagreus.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It's good to see Mother's back. Not that I was too concerned, but... I was definitely a little concerned.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I shared in that particular concern, and yes... it is good the Queen has once again returned. And she shall have to depart again before we know it, so cherish your time with her, boy!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
They have.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tell me, in brief, boy. Our own upon Olympus... are they continuing to aid you as expected?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Still showing up and lending their support. I think some of them are a little disappointed I'm not planning to come join them, though... I think they understand now that they owe the Underworld a debt. We all have to do our part, looking after the mortals. Whether alive or dead.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Indeed. I half-expected they would disappoint. Abandon you to toil on your own. At least thus far they've honored their commitment, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"But, they're family...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Pah.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So, are you maintaining better contact now with Uncle Zeus, Uncle Poseidon, and the rest? Oh, and... is it all right for me to speak about them here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Urgh... I'm certain the superficial messages we have exchanged shall taper off, with time. We have always been apart, irrespective of the distance separating us. I know Zeus is content with your mother's version of events. Thus we are at peace, for now.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Wait, what do you mean, for now?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I mean only that our family is prone to causing problems for itself. Never content to leave things well enough alone. But if we have little to do with them... their quarrels, all their nonsense on Olympus... it should be of no consequence.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Precisely.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The latest reports indicate that mortals are fully twice as fearful of ending up in Tartarus as in our last evaluation period, thanks to the destruction you have caused. You are an unseen power in the Underworld. Commendable.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Commendable, me? An unseen power, huh. Surprised you're giving me the credit, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I give credit where it's due. But the mortals? They know nothing of what transpires here. Only rumblings we permit to escape our realm... rumblings that reinforce their deepest fears about what shall transpire after their demise.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"So the more havoc I wreak in the Underworld, the more mortals hear about all the unpleasantness, and... it makes them fearful of this place? If more of them lead upstanding lives, it'll keep Tartarus from overflowing, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whatever you may wish to say, I do not wish to hear it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You're interrupting me during my time at work.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I think I've heard more than enough from you lately.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're willfully wasting my time, aren't you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go, get out. Don't let me stop you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Shouldn't you be getting skewered by the dead?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go to your room, or anywhere but here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blood and darkness, what is it with you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Have you come up with more impertinence to spout at me?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I'll not be bothered with your disrespect.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Has it occurred to you that I'm preoccupied?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I am uninterested in conversing with you, boy.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your presence is no longer welcome here.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
How possibly could I have given the impression that I wished to talk?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
You realize just how much property of mine you have defaced?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Fail all you like, you're never getting out of here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You'll learn your place, the hard way, evidently.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"To suffer such indignity, from my own kin.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Such foolishness as yours I scarce can comprehend.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
We've nothing left now to discuss between us.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Whatever you may wish to say, I do not wish to hear it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Have I mentioned that you're never getting out of here?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're here to stay, boy. All of us are.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I'm busy now, as you can plainly see.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Blasted parchmentwork, it never goes away.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your recent efforts have proved useful to this place.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Go instill some fear in those wretches out there, would you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"He's back again, Cerberus! I'll try not to keep him for as long, next time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Doubtless I shall get you for that one next time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Another satyr outbreak to look out for next you venture there...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Be certain to give your regards to your mother as well!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Repairs for all the carnage that you sowed are already underway.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What else can we do to contain you, I wonder...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I have some catching up to do, as you can see.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ah, we ought to reconvene the court now, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"As you can see, I must attend to all this parchmentwork.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I must say, you made a hollow mockery of Theseus that time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Our security efforts in Asphodel are evidently lacking.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Go rest yourself if need be. Though the Underworld is ready when you are.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Against my better judgment, I went easier on you that time.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Thus starts and ends our brief exchange of pleasantries.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Continue to perform your duties as you have.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Cerberus there was anticipating your return.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your mother expected this most recent result of yours.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Do I appear as though I've time for conversation, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Let us discuss your work performance at some other time.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your infamy throughout Elysium has only grown.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
I must admit... that was a job well done back there.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hey, uh, Father. I thought, maybe, you know, here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Where did you get this...? You think you can butter me up with such trifles? Give me that, and then get out of here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hey, uh, Father. I thought, maybe, you know, here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You owe me nothing, certainly not this. And I've nothing to give you in exchange. But fine, I'll honor our custom. Give it here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Erm, Father... I know we can't exactly change the past, but we can try to move forward. Look, I know I'm not even supposed to have this stuff, but everyone likes it, won't you try it, at least? Here, take it, either way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hrm. I... can dispose of this properly. Speaking of disposal... I've no further need for this, here, so... rid me of it, why don't you? On your way out.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why not!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"More Nectar for the old disposal service, Father, if you don't mind. Come on, you must have tried the stuff, at least in the days before you were here! Didn't you ever enjoy yourself, at any point?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't require beverages in order to enjoy myself, boy. Unlike so many of your kin upon their mountain. Yet this blasted substance somehow finds its way to my domain. Then, fine! You wish for the customs here to be more akin to Olympus, why not?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, with that attitude...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Have another bottle, why don't you, Father? Not like it's going to change anything between us, right? All the Nectar in the Underworld can't change what's already happened. Or change yourself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hrm. You're probably correct. You must think it is my age that makes me obstinate. Unable to change my nature. But I have always been inflexible. You think I'm proud of it? You call me 'Father' like it's an insult. I deserve the title only as a technicality, I know.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You could start being a better father at any point. There's no one stopping you but you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, well... unfortunately, I am a significant impediment. You should be well aware of that. You were able to stop me. I have thus far been unable to do so...",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"All right. Well, it's a start.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Enough of this, boy! Even mortals know better. I don't want your Nectar, or Ambrosia, or whichever offerings. You owe me no such thing, and I shall not accept it any longer. In fact, here... you shall take all of it back!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why? It's just Nectar, Father, lighten up. I get that you're surly about everything, but please at least try toward decency with me! If not for me, then for Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
How dare you lecture me? I mean... urgh... look. As you told me yourself... there's no changing what already transpired. And our memories are warnings. When you have lived as long as I have... you come to understand your weaknesses.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What are you getting at? You're just going to give up, stick with what's comfortable for you instead of making any real effort at making peace with your son?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Rngh. Listen to me. My attempts at making peace are going to be rather subtle for your tastes. I cannot change the past. And there is only so much I can do about the future. I tell you this because... I shall not lie to you again. That much, I swear.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Father's not back yet, huh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Father's still up there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Father...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"As far as I know, yes, lad. That it is. Though whose, exactly, I'm not so sure. You'd best hang onto it, and keep it safe. Your weapons... they shall thirst for it and drink it up. Not yet, perhaps, but soon.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Sell it or keep it, huh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, look at what I got out there, Achilles sir! A vintage bottle of Ambrosia, plucked straight from Elysium! I hear this stuff is very good, but... can't even open it. I've no idea what to do with it, right now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The drink of the gods! I hear it's good, all right. But only for recipients with whom you're close. Perhaps hang onto it until it's ripe for use? Somebody would be grateful I am sure. Or it could fetch you something from the Wretched Broker over there.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I'll have to take your word for it.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, sir, I have a very important question... why do you detest onions so much? Have they wronged you, somehow?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"As soon as you slice into one of those things... it makes you cry. Don't you find that a bit unsettling, lad? I won't shed tears over a cut-up vegetable.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your extended family, the Olympians... they wish to help you from this place, don't they? I just hope that their intentions are as pure as they appear. They don't get on well with your father.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Neither do I, last time I checked. I'll take all the help I can get trying to break out of here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm pleased to hear you say that. I have known too many far too proud to accept help, even when it was sorely needed. You just be careful, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Talk later. Best not keep your father waiting.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Thank you for the advice, Achilles, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Well, you know, just... the usual struggles of battling toward the surface, generally to some ignoble death, though... wait, you mean between myself and Megaera, don't you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think she likes you more than she lets on. You have a certain way, besides. I know you two got off to a rough start. And circumstances lately haven't helped. But, if you love her... follow your heart.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"And, what if I don't...? I hesitate to even use the word.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you don't... then cease with giving her such lavish gifts, I ought to think! No need to send the wrong impression, and there is nothing to be gained from such an empty gesture, anyhow.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"Whoa, just a moment, there, I mean... I've never said something like that, have I?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You haven't, no. And it is not my business to presume too much. Nevertheless, if your friendship with Thanatos is bounded... then, I would suggest you cease with giving him more lavish gifts. No need to send the wrong impression, right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Right. You're right, Achilles.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hold just a moment, lad. That look... I think I know it all too well. Things getting complicated for you lately, then?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"If I may presume a bit, I gather that they share by now the feelings that you have for each of them; each in their respective way, of course. If you love them... one, the other, perhaps both? I mean, you're gods...! Follow your heart.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Whoa, just a moment, there, I mean... ugh, I suppose you're not presuming much at all. Follow my heart, though? Where?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wherever it should lead; that's how it works. Yours to decide when you've gone as far as you ought, and cease with the lavish gifts. No need to send the wrong impression, and there's nothing to be gained from such an empty gesture, anyhow, right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I'm nothing like him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I think I see that look again, if I am not mistaken in it, lad. What's on your mind? If you would like to share, I'm listening.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, it's just... sometimes, I find my thoughts, they wander between those I care about, it's... not just one. You mortals, typically you had a single suitor, did you not...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So we often told each other, yes. But... you're not like us mortals, or us shades. Nor are most of the others here. You gods... I cannot think of even one who had a single mate. Although, your father... maybe he is one.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Wait, you're saying Father, he was never with somebody else besides... my mother?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, I of course don't know so very much about him, lad. But that's the way of it, from what I've learned. You needn't follow in his footsteps, though; I think you know that well enough by now.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Thanks, Achilles. That means a lot.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Meant to tell you. Recently, I noticed Megaera, and... I believe I saw the faintest smile play across her lips. That anything to do with you, perhaps? Not asking for specifics, mind.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You really think that has to do with me...? I mean, I hope you're right, and I suppose it's possible, it's just... how can you tell?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perhaps with time, I've grown keen to more than just the weaknesses of my enemies on the battlefield. Especially since I don't have those anymore. I'm happy for you, lad. The two of you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
He is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I have to tell you something, lad. When Thanatos returned to seek you out, I was very concerned. Not just for you, either. But you've since patched things up...?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I think so. I hope so. It was complicated for a while there, but... I think things are clearer for us, now. Not just in the moment, but in retrospect. Ugh, I'm not making any sense.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, on the contrary. I think I know exactly what you mean. I don't know Thanatos particularly well. Wasn't he who brought me here, you see. And he was always very busy, like your father. But, he always struck me as a decent sort.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, I ran into Meg's sisters out there. We didn't really hit it off. Meg said they're not permitted in the House. Not that I'm complaining, but... what's that about?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They have not earned the right, lad. Nor expressed any desire to exist here with the rest of us. Your father has assigned them to specific roles that suit their dispositions. They're... not as sensible as Megaera, in my experience.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"That's what I was afraid of. Although, fear is for the weak.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"I will. You're right as always, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You saw that Thanatos is back, didn't you, lad? He's been over there brooding, when he's around, at least.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I saw, Achilles. I think he's angry with me because of my decision to leave the House. Not that it's any of his business.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, don't say that. It isn't everyday or night when one discovers that his closest friend has had it with his temperamental father, and decided to leave home. I think he's struggling with what to make of it. Be gentle with him, will you?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I'm not the god of anything, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Achilles, I... uncovered a late passage in the Codex, with regard to Thanatos and me. It says, you say, you think that I'm the god of blood? I'm not the god of anything, I think...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, nonsense, lad! If you're a god, then you're the god of something, I'm sure. It's just an observation, and I genuinely hope it's no offense. But, see... your father, and your mother, and your bloodstones, and your disposition...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Not a concern, just a morbid curiosity.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, I've been meaning to ask you about the odd skeleton usually standing around in the courtyard. Old acquaintance of yours? A hireling, perhaps?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That one, Skelly, was it? We only met when all this business of escape began. If I have a connection to him, I am unaware. Does he claim to know me? Perhaps I slew him when we were alive.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I don't know that that's it. So neither of us has any idea where he's from or how he got there, huh. Can you think of any leads? Nyx doesn't seem to know him, either.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perhaps the gods of Olympus sent him to your aid? Their methods can be odd. And, there are many who support you. Regardless, he does not appear to be your father's spy, if that is your concern.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Maybe both. I've met the sort.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Remember that Skelly character out in the courtyard, sir? Turns out he's been working with Charon all this time. Working for him more like! I had so much help in this, from all of you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Charon! Of course. He has a stake in all that goes on in the Underworld. And he probably thinks highly of you. This Skelly character, though... he must have been somebody if Charon's confided in him.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"He won't tell me. He was either a venerable sea captain, or a petty thief. Maybe both?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
They drifted apart...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"In my recent audience with Nyx, lad, she let on that you have mentioned Chaos as of late. Is it true you've met her parent, yourself?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I have. Chaos is... not like anyone I've ever met. At first I was a little worried, meeting this vast primordial entity apparently responsible for all creation, but... they seem all right. Chaos and Nyx haven't been talking for a while, though. You don't know what happened there, do you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know a little bit, I think. Nyx, she and Chaos, they just... slowly drifted apart. No animosity, not anymore, at least. It happens between parents and children. And once such ties are severed, they cannot always be restored. Especially among primordial gods as old as time, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Yeah... I can see that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Wanted to ask you more about Nyx and Chaos, sir. So they just drifted apart, I mean... why not just keep in touch? I don't understand. How hard is it just to say hello from time to time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It can be harder than you know. For someone like Nyx... she was responsible for no small part of creation, herself. As her relationship with Chaos grew more strained, she gave birth to Strife, Misery, Doom... sons and daughters you don't hear about too much.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"What, really? I've never heard Hypnos or Thanatos mention any of them, let alone Nyx. They sound like a handful. Where are they, what happened?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know, lad. On the surface, I suppose? My point is, Nyx had her own problems to contend with. Dealing with her brood, governing the Underworld all on her own before your father arrived. Her relationship with Chaos suffered for it.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I couldn't stand it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Lad, I heard from Nyx! She said that she was able recently to reestablish contact with Chaos, thanks to you? You're just full of surprises, reforging old bonds between primordial gods like it was nothing.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, just took a bit of tampering with the Sigil in the admin chamber. Whole bunch of Darkness, too. But I could tell that Nyx and Chaos, they... seemed to really miss each other, to the extent they are able to miss anybody.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think they're plenty capable of missing their loved ones, lad. The amount of time that either of us have existed... it's nothing compared to either of them. Imagine, being apart from someone you care about, for that long...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"That it did most definitely, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, sir? You happen to know whether Father authorized the transfer of a Macedonian Tau-Lambda chariot to Elysium in recent memory? I ran into the former hero Theseus, all joyriding about in one of those.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know the chariot you mean. It's not just any Macedonian. It's modified, apparently by Daedalus, himself. No earthly weapons can do what it does. Though, please don't tell me Theseus put on that mask...?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"What, you mean the golden matching mask? I saw him wearing it, all right. Looked like a proper fool, I thought. What of it, though?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahah, well! I think that Daedalus would certainly agree. Heard that he fashioned that mask and outfit as a little joke. For someone deeply prideful, and well unaware. It must have suited Theseus quite well, then, yes?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"In the mean time, I'll take good care of them.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, wanted to ask you more about the weapons I've been using. They can change shape! So, they've molded themselves to suit me, and remember their past wielders, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Something like that. They seem alive, don't they? Taking everything in. I think they long predate even your father's time. Some have seen many different owners. Chances are, you shall not be the last.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"As you may know, lad, I've a connection to the weapons that you use, having once wielded one of them myself. Of course not knowing its significance back then, but I digress. Sometimes, it... well, it keeps in touch. And I've a vision from it to impart.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"What, you mean a vision from Varatha the Eternal Spear? That's... out of the ordinary, and also a bit concerning. So, what did you see?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well... I saw a great, bearded warrior. Bigger than me, pitch-black hair. Bearing an aspect of Varatha unlike any with which I'm familiar. Then he was gone. But, what still lingered were these words: I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I see you through the eyes of the crimson phoenix... I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
There's one more thing. This was not my first such vision. Long ago... I saw one of Varatha's other bearers. It was you. Your Infernal Arms... they must be weapons of the Fates' design. They know already who shall brandish them. Now they ask a favor. Seek Varatha. Speak the words. Go.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Fear is for the weak.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles...! Something awakened in Varatha when I spoke the words. It revealed to me a form I'd never seen. Wielded by the warrior called Guan Yu. Handsomely dressed! And just as you described. That's no Greek name, is it...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, I don't think so, lad. I don't know who this Guan Yu is, or where he's from. Or even when he's from. But the Fates must have a plan for him, and you. Anyway... I think my part in this is ended. Varatha's served you well, no? I trusted it in life; I trust it now. Fear is for the weak.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Must be the regular feedings.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, sir! I've uncovered the hidden aspect for Stygius! Nyx gave me the words this time, and a vision of a noble leader among mortals. An entire armored legion of them! Arthur was his name. Will be his name, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A future leader among men, wielding that blade? The mysteries of the Infernal Arms run deep, don't they. Although it seems that you and Stygius formed quite a bond.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I have this feeling that he will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Heart-Seeker. Lady Artemis herself told me the words, and... it seems Coronacht belonged to, maybe will belong to somebody called Rama. Peerless with the bow. Even among gods...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Many lay claim to peerlessness with bows in my experience, there, lad, although... I'm not to judge a vision from an ancient weapon such as that. I hope this Rama shall use his weapon wisely when the time comes; same as you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I doubt he would be any match for you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, sir, I've revealed the hidden aspect of the Shield of Chaos... thanks to Chaos, themself. Apparently someday it'll protect an armored warrior known as Beowulf from all sorts of dangers... even a dragon! Mortals don't stand much of a chance against those, do they?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Depends upon the dragon, I suppose. I've heard they differ all across the world. Though, that's a fascinating find, there, lad. This Beowulf... sounds like he'll find a way to make good use of all that protective gear. Always preferred mobility, myself, but then, to each his own.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I know the type. Both types.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"The Bull of Minos led me to another hidden aspect, Achilles! A beastly form of the Twin Fists, belonging to an ancient god-king known as Gilgamesh. You ever hear that name? He had a half-beast friend, apparently. Like how Asterius is friend to Theseus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Gilgamesh, you said...? That name isn't familiar to me, but... with these hidden aspects, there's bound to be a connection to the future, or the past. Say, why is the Bull of Minos aiding you? I thought he was one of your rivals barring passage from Elysium.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, he is. He's loyal through and through to Theseus, and never holds back when we fight. But he seems to be the respect-for-his-opponent type. Unlike his companion.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll take it as a warning. Even the Rail has its limits.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, I discovered the hidden aspect of the Adamant Rail, after Lord Zeus himself told me the waking-phrase. It's from a winged fellow by the name of Lucifer... apparently had a bit of a falling out with his lord father. Wonder how that worked out for him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh! Perhaps it's from a time even before the Olympians rebelled against the Titans. But I've never heard of any Lucifer, with or without wings. Suggests to me, perhaps that falling out of his did not work out so well.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
It sounds absurd when you put it quite like that... but yes.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, something I've been wondering... now that I've discovered all the hidden aspects of my weapons... as far as I know, anyway... I can't see any pattern there, at all. Guan Yu, Gilgamesh, Rama, and so on... any idea why them?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"To know for certain, I suppose you'd have to ask the Fates, themselves... and get an answer from them, too. I ask myself how come you found an aspect of mine, among them all. What made me so special, do you suppose?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You were a great warrior! Famous, in your time! It's no surprise to me at all the Fates chose you to have a stint with one of their world-altering weapons.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, that's just it! I was quite famous, yes. Infamous, perhaps, but no matter. Perhaps it's just that these weapons demand to make themselves known, above all. To leave a lasting impression in the hands of their wielders.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
You think the Infernal Arms just want to be popular? Have exciting stories told about them and whatnot?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can't imagine you weren't always a good listener, Achilles.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I've had the opportunity to use your aspect of Varatha, sir. So, you once wielded it yourself? It... fills me with a hunger for battle even more so than usual. A bit of your fighting spirit, perhaps.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Be very wary of that spirit, lad. It was what brought me here before my time. Although that spear indeed once served me well. A parting gift from my old master Chiron. He cautioned me as I am cautioning you. Though, may you be a better listener.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I'm sure his skill did most of the work.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, I meant to ask, did you know that Coronacht the Heart-Seeker once belonged to the centaur, Chiron? Because one of its aspects is his own. He didn't have it back when you trained with him, did he...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Master Chiron, truly...? Ah, of course. He granted me a spear, I think you know. If he possessed one such weapon, why not more? I remember his bow shined like the sun. It was splendid, and never missed its mark... though I attributed that to Chiron's extraordinary skill.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Well this should help you keep an eye on him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I have to thank you for the mirror back there, lad. Lets me get a better look at things out in the great hall every now and then.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Of course, sir, don't mention it. You're really stuck having to guard this corridor most of the time, huh?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh certainly, it's an important corridor! Think of it, if just any shade could pass through either of those doors back there. Your father's barely keeping it together, as it is.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I'm sure he's in no hurry to return.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Quite a statue you commissioned over there. I suppose I can think of worse subjects than mighty Heracles for me to have to stand about and stare at.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"They say he was the strongest demigod who ever lived. Though, I bet you could take him, sir. Big guy like that, you'd be too quick, I'm sure. You ever meet him?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Only in passing. He once died a mortal's death... worse than mine. Had a brief stint down here, but... he's favored by Olympus. Got a special arrangement of some sort, I heard. Haven't seen him since.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Don't know how I'd ever find something in there, but I suppose so, yes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, looks like I could buy back my right to go in the administrative chamber, there. I never want to go in there again, but... can you think of any reason whatsoever that I should?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah, well. Perhaps we all want what we cannot have. Other than that, I suppose certain documents or records in there could be of some benefit under the circumstances, right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Most definitely!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That Chthonic Companion you gave me, sir... have to say it's been amazing to see you and Patroclus in action. I thought you said your fighting days were over?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, well... that was before I was reunited with Patroclus, and had the opportunity to help you in a pinch, with him at my side. I trust we were of some small service, then?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I hope you're right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, I... sometimes I fear that Father, if he learns that you've been aiding me, that he will... not be generous with you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't worry about me, lad. Your father's still getting caught up with work that I created for him in my mortal days. Besides... there's nothing he can take from me. We have a mutual arrangement, he and I.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I... fear is for the weak.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, I'm concerned that Father's growing angrier with you. He thinks you've taken sides against him in all this. I don't want anything to happen.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's right, lad. I have taken sides. But, as for you not wanting anything to happen... while I know what you meant, I don't want you to say such things again. Do you understand? You're doing this because something here needs to happen. Hold back your fear.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Wanted to say, the Lady Aphrodite asked that I relay a message to you, sir. She said that she admires you. Mentioned a certain war.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Admires me, does she? Sometimes, lad, I think that Aphrodite is the mightiest of all the gods. Her power is what spurs us all to action. Whether to love, or war. Or sometimes both the two. I'm grateful for the message.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Hey, Achilles! I heard from Lady Artemis out there. It seems you have a bit of a fan in her. She wanted me to tell you you're the best! She's not mistaken, by the way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The goddess of the hunt herself said that? That's very flattering to hear. Good thing she doesn't know I'm all washed up, by now. Her memory is of my glory days.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Indeed I have.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, have you ever run across the shade of Daedalus in all your time? I've found some of his legendary hammers out there, but no sign of him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've never met him, no. Your father keeps him fully occupied with building out his Underworld, and renovating constantly. No wonder some of his old crafting-tools are strewn about. I take it you've been able to make use of them?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"They're helping, definitely, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, did you ever use to pray to the gods? Make offerings to them and such, back when you were alive?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prayed mostly to my mother, lad. I always had my doubts the gods were listening. That they could even hear. Though, I suppose that if you make an offering, they might be so inclined, just for the moment, anyway. They helping much?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
...I will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You have a worried look about you, lad. Spare me your thoughts?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, it's just... I met the goddess Demeter out there. The blessings that she offered, they... just drained the heat and life from everything. I thought she saw to fruits and grains and vegetables and such? Not that I'm complaining.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All gods and goddesses are to be feared. Demeter, she has the power to give life, or take it. Seems she's more interested in the latter, though. She's the eldest on Olympus, and your father seems to harbor a particular dislike for her. I don't know why. Be careful.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I'll talk to her.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, what happened between Nyx and Dusa? Dusa's really gone?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx cut her off, lad. I'm sorry. I know you cared about her. I was as surprised as you when I found out. I knew that Nyx had her concerns about Dusa's propensity to overwork herself, but... this wasn't the step I was expecting.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Propensity to overwork herself... you really think that's what this was about? I can't shake the feeling it's my fault. Nyx didn't want her talking to me, as though she's beneath me or something! Ugh, what am I going to do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look... I don't have all the information on this one, and neither do you from the sound of things. Nyx loves you and respects you. I trust she would want to know how this affects you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, I let her know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, what happened between Nyx and Dusa? Dusa's really gone?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx cut her off, lad. I'm sorry. I know you cared about her. I was as surprised as you when I found out. I knew that Nyx had her concerns about Dusa's propensity to overwork herself, but... this wasn't the step I was expecting.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Propensity to overwork herself... you really think that's what this was about? I can't shake the feeling it's my fault. Nyx didn't want her talking to me, as though she's beneath me or something! Ugh, what am I going to do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look... I don't have all the information on this one, and neither do you from the sound of things. Nyx loves you and respects you. I trust she would want to know how this affects you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I'm just glad she's back.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Did you see, sir? Dusa's returned! Nyx must have reconsidered her decision.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She must have, indeed, lad. I was pleased to see Dusa return. And you know what...? I daresay she seemed rather well-rested, for a change. It might not have been the best of circumstances, though my hope is that some good has come of it.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I understand you've made it all the way to Asphodel of late, haven't you, lad?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I guess word travels faster than I do. Why do you ask, Achilles?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...No reason in particular. Just that it brings me joy to hear of your progress.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Their pride. I'll remember that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I haven't seen you in a while, lad. You made it to Elysium last time, didn't you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I did, Achilles. It's crawling with great warriors still looking for a fight. It's not exactly what I was expecting.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your father's marshalled the most willing ones to deal with you. Doubtless there's much at stake in it for them, if but the pride of having done the task. Although I think that pride will always be their weakness.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"That's good, then. Glad to hear it.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I couldn't help but notice, lad, that Cerberus has been away for quite some time. Turns out your father's put him back to work above. I truly hope you shall not have to come to blows.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Don't worry, sir. I've run into Cerberus up top, all right. Even if he's technically Father's pet, he'd never bare his fangs at me. No matter how much Father might wish otherwise.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Indeed, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I don't wish to presume, lad, but you seem more glum than usual. What's weighing on you, there, if you don't mind?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, it's just... I've never slain a living creature, sir. Until my recent journey to the Temple up above. I know they're just Satyrs and vermin, but... it's not the same as sending wretches to the depths.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look. All mortal life is fragile; it simply is a struggle to survive. Sooner or later it fails to succeed, and then, it ends up here. And we have room enough for everyone, even the Satyrs and the vermin of the world.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Now that you mention it, I have to say I'm glad we can accommodate all former-living things. And at least mortals get to rest assured knowing what happens once they die! Must really ease the mind.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Just a god...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I saw your father storm out of the House in his regalia. So he must have confronted you himself, at last. I... see that must have not gone well. You were so close.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Well, at least I know who will be waiting for me the next time I climb all the way to the Temple of Styx and manage my way out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't lose heart, lad. I did not train your father, only you. He is a god; but he is just a god. If you'll forgive my bit of treason there.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
It is. I have to speak with her.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I found her, sir! My mother, she's... alive and well, and... ugh, but I just couldn't stay up there, for very long. I have to get back to her!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You really made it all the way? You must have... gotten past your father, that's amazing, lad. But, wait, what was she like, what happened to you there?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"She was... she was great! Nothing like Father, more like... you, a little bit, I guess! Though, being on the surface, it just seemed to suck the life right out of me. Even without the wretches of the Underworld trying to do me in.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But then, you had a little time at least! Sounds like you have unfinished business with her, there. You got to her this once... surely you're able to again, isn't that right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Yes. I will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How did it go, lad? You've been gone a while. For good reason, I hope?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I found her, again, sir, and... we were able to talk some more. But, I have so many questions left for her, and Father's certainly not been of any help...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, first of all, good work. I knew you had it in you. Secondly... you know what you have to do. Go find her, for as many chances as it takes. It's not just her you've sought... it's the answers to those questions that you have.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Thanks, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, you can tell me in due time if you decide to, lad. But I do have a question, same as you did, going into this. Why did she leave? Why did she leave you, in particular?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"It's that she didn't even know I was alive. Sounds as though Nyx revived me sometime after I was born, but by that point... Mother had already left, and... they let her be. For reasons I am trying to find out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, that's... quite a bit to take in, there. And it explains more than a bit, I think. Look, I'm not one to speculate too much. I trust you'll find the answers that you seek as you proceed.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I hope you're right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What news this time, lad? Did you find your mother, once again?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"No, I failed, sir. No thanks to Father! Urgh, what am I going to do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Just take it easy, now. You got there once, there isn't any question in my mind that you can do it once again. Your father's acting as though nothing's changed, besides. So, don't lose hope. You're capable of this.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Indeed, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Hey, tell me something, sir. Any rumors swirling about the House regarding the outcome of a certain interaction I had with my father recently? Involving a great deal of violence? Because I'd like for everyone to know: I won.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I wouldn't know of what you mean, there, lad. For there are certain subjects so forbidden here right now that not even rumors can take hold. But, just between us for the time: Congratulations. Truly.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Thank you, sir. I didn't know whether I had it in me. As for the other bit, I'll keep it quiet, then, for now. I probably shouldn't be tying my sense of self-worth to praise from friends, acquaintances, and strangers, anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Thank you. It's mine as well.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Queen is back! You did it, lad. You must have lots of catching up to do. Or patching up. And, I'm to understand that your escape attempts, they are officially approved, isn't that so?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"That's so, indeed, sir. Especially for now, at least, I'm going to keep on fighting to the surface. Helps me to vent a bit, and, like Hypnos says, it makes the Underworld a better place! Though indirectly, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, then, I look forward to working with you in a more formal capacity. And, it is my sincerest hope that you, your mother, and your father learn to get on better with each other, now.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
AchillesIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Mother can be quite persuasive!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey sir, meant to say I hope I didn't get you into too much trouble after letting me in Father's bedchambers.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Think nothing of it, lad. It was a risk I was willing to take, and for his part, your father looked the other way on that one. Though I did not expect you'd get free rein to go there as you please.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
And you in turn.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"So, lad, tell me, then. How went the family feast, was everything all right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Well, I confess I was perhaps a little nervous for practically the entire thing, but... all in all, I had a good time, and I'm very, very glad it all turned out the way it did. How about yourself?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I quite enjoyed it, too. Last time I was invited to a feast, I was still busy warring on the surface, that's how long it's been. I must say, your mother is quite good with words! Had everybody chatting, laughing...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"She really pulled it off! But... for all her confidence, I don't think she knew she had it in her. Because if she did... if she reached out to Olympus sooner... a lot of things could have been different.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't dwell on that. I spoke a bit with Nyx. Your mother had her reasons. No one gets to act on perfect information, right? All we have is what we think we know, and what our conscience tells us. Your mother got to where all this was possible... all thanks to you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"All thanks to me, sir? I had ample help along the way. For instance, I could not have done it without you. Would have been using an old chair leg as a weapon, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And what a fearsome chair leg it would be! In any case... you heading out there, soon? Olympus should be more than happy to assist in your security review. If that's what we're calling it now.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Yeah, I should go. I'll see you not too long from now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hahaha, well... you got me there.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I'm so impressed with what you've managed to accomplish, lad. When I was closer to your age... or, the age you appear to be... all I wanted was glory. To be remembered forever. Look where that got me! I'm glad you know better than I did.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"So in pursuing glory... you think you lost it? Forgive me, here, but I just disagree. I settled a family squabble. You single-handedly turned an entire war!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A foolish war. Glory comes to those driven to excel in worthwhile pursuits. A happy side effect, not a goal unto itself. Though, you don't need for me to tell you that.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"If not for all your training and advice, I wouldn't have come this far. You prepared me for this. Wasn't that a worthwhile pursuit? Must mean you got some glory after all, then, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're getting somewhere with that Codex, lad. I'm pleased to see it. My duties to the House have meant that, lately, I can't travel quite as much as once I did.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I'll try to travel for the both of us, Achilles. I've seen so little other than these walls.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, look at you, lad, with that Codex brimming with our history! I knew I could rely on you to fill it out. Back when I was alive, why, no one would have ever believed what goes on down here.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Mortals must have had their stories, though. About what happens to them once they die, and once they end up in this place.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They have their stories, definitely so. They fear your father, understandably. They also fear your dog. But most of them know precious little else. Even their fears, I think, are born of ignorance. As most fears tend to be.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh. Of course, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, sir... within the Codex, you'd written something, about someone with whom you shared your life... when you were flesh and blood?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Ah. That is a private matter for me, lad. From a time I had convinced myself the Codex would be for my own eyes, alone. My past is not really worth mentioning. And, I am presently on duty, so... begging your pardon, please.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I see. I think. I'm grateful for it, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Erm, Achilles sir, there's something I've been wondering, about your Codex. The words are yours, and yet it's through my actions that I'm able to absorb them. Is that how mortal scriptures always work?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah. You have to understand, lad, I've been here in your father's realm for quite some time. My documented learnings became bound to me, much like this spear, you see? You can undo those bindings over time. Thus my knowledge can be yours. Whatever it amounts to.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Hah, I suppose that's true.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I had the strangest feeling, lad, you mind if... can I see that Codex, there?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Of course, sir! I've been keeping busy with it, you could say. It's almost complete!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractEquip,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It is complete! That's amazing... a chronicle of this place... everything I've ever learned and felt.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Still always more to learn and feel, though, isn't there?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah, I suppose that's true.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Achilles? My father's hall back there. I don't suppose you'll let me have myself a look? Lots for me to rummage through, I'm sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know I'd do just about anything to aid you, lad. But my ability to do so hinges on me sticking to my post. Though if I do catch wind of anything back there requiring attention, you shall know.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I'd ask you join me for a drink, lad, but I know you've a task ahead of you, and liquor dulls the senses. Fortunately so, under most circumstances except yours. Leave me to it, will you, and I'll have one for the both of us.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Some other time, Achilles. Just checking in on you, but I'll be on my way again shortly.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles, would you... tell me something more of Patroclus? You mentioned you were very close.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We could have been no closer. The ashes of our bodies yet mingle together somewhere on the surface there. What can I tell you, lad? I loved him with all my heart. And he left me too soon.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, surely he must be in the Underworld, somewhere... have you not tried to seek him out? Or asked my father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah, haha. I tried, lad, I have tried. On both accounts. What you propose is not that simple, it turns out. You've seen what it is like out there... it's difficult to find one's way. But I shall tell you what. If you see Patroclus among the countless shades, you tell him I said hi.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, would you... tell me something more of Patroclus? You mentioned you were very close.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We could have been no closer. The ashes of our bodies yet mingle together somewhere on the surface there. What can I tell you, lad? I loved him with all my heart. And he left me too soon.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But now you're both here, in the Underworld! Can't you go seek him out? Or alter your arrangement with my father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ha, hah. I tried, lad, I have tried. On both accounts. What you propose is not that simple, it turns out. But I shall tell you what. When next you see Patroclus on your journeys, you keep speaking to him for me, won't you?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"How fare your labors, lad? You have a certain look about you. Everything all right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"It's just... within Elysium, I happened on a shade, who said he knew you. Said he misses you. Do you know a Patroclus, sir?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What... I... yes. I knew Patroclus, did he... is he all right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"He... I don't know. He seems like he's known better times than these. Is... there something I should say to him, if I run into him again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Please send him my regards. And... all my love. I think of him always. But I cannot see him any longer. And you mustn't ask me why, do you understand? Now, leave me be, please, lad. I need some time.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"How fare your labors, lad? You have a certain look about you. Everything all right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"It's just... within Elysium, I happened on a shade. It's your Patroclus. He's all right, but he seems like he's known better times than these. Is there something I should say to him, if I run into him again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh...! Well, then, please send him my regards. And... all my love. I think of him always. But I cannot see him any longer. And you mustn't ask me why, do you understand? Now, leave me be, please, lad. I need some time.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"Hey, listen a moment, lad. I require your discretion with regards to whom we spoke about last time. The shade you met within Elysium.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I understand. What can I do about this, sir? There must be something. But, you have to let me know what's going on.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Simply put, he is the reason that I'm here. Patroclus lost his life before I did. Because of me. I shortly followed, in a rage. When I arrived here, I received a hero's welcome. Your father himself ushered me to Elysium. But that's not what I wanted.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You wanted to see Patroclus. But, he's in Elysium, while you... oh, no.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I signed a pact, lad. Felt that the terms were good enough. He could live there, while I'd live here, at least for now. Such deals are most uncommon, and their confidentiality must be upheld. But, let's speak no more of this for now, all right? Some other time.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"You have to tell me more about this pact you signed, Achilles. You and Patroclus... so, you're doomed to never be together, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You must safeguard the details of it, lad. Although it's not as bad as you make out. I ensured Patroclus is provided for. We wouldn't have been together anyway. Initially he wasn't sent into Elysium, you see.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"There has to be a way for me to make this right. Not just for him, for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You've other, pressing matters to attend to, lad. And Patroclus and I have ample time to wait this out. I know you mean well, but... do not discuss this matter with your father, now. I fear that it could make things worse. Do you understand?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"The... fallen warrior in Elysium we spoke of. He seems like a good man, though... was he always the despondent sort?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, lad. I was that sort, I think, but he was not. He was... one of the only men I knew who did not look upon me as a threat. He saw something in me I never knew was there. And in turn, with him, I felt... how to describe it? Calm. Whole.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Hah! I'm restless all the time. I can only imagine.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
He had this wry humor about him. Like he was wise beyond his years. A quality I trust shall see him through his struggles now. Although... I hoped residing in Elysium would mean he wouldn't have to struggle any longer.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
...Of course.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I know that it's a painful subject, sir, but can you tell me... what exactly happened, in the war that claimed Patroclus and yourself? He brought it up. Said you refused to fight.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Until he died. I did refuse to fight, until he died, but at that point... ungh, look, lad, if we're going to discuss these matters, best we do so in the lounge, not here.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
AchillesIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...The fool of a king I served... I'd never take up arms, for him. But, Patroclus, he always had a different way of looking at things. As I refused to fight, he rose to the occasion. Took up my armor, led my brothers into battle, in my guise. Fought nobly... but then, he... well.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
And after you found out... you sought vengeance for him. Took vengeance.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That I did. They got me, finally, of course. But, not before I broke them, first. The war soon ended, after that. It is an awful contradiction, that to quickly end war, one need only extinguish many lives at once. I had not realized it at the time.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Did you... allow yourself to die? So that you could see Patroclus again, here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I don't know. Maybe. I only know that I was filled with rage. Rage that subsided, soon after I arrived here. I felt... empty. I never saw Patroclus again. But, I learned my brothers honored my last request, as my ashes were laid to rest with his. <Sigh> Anyway...! Appreciate the drink.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
AchillesIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Suppose I'd best be getting back to standing quietly about. Though, that war, lad? Don't ask me about it again. All right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"How is he, anyway, if you've encountered him of late during your journeys, lad? The fallen warrior you've run into in Elysium, that is.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"He's doing relatively well, I think. There's a lot you've told me... that he didn't know. About what led up to his present circumstances, and your own.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You told him, then. Without requesting my consent to tell him, first! What, exactly, did you say to him?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, I... I'm sorry, I... just told him about your ashes being intermingled, that whole thing? And about the pact. You told me once to send him your love and regards! This brought him no joy, only questions! You told me not to speak to Father, not to him!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"<Sigh>...You're right, I... should have specified. Or shouldn't have. Because what you said, probably is for the best. I didn't mean to lose my temper with you, lad, it's just... look, thank you for looking out for him. For both of us. Just, please be careful.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I have a message for you from the fallen warrior over in Elysium, Achilles sir. He says... he simply said to let you know to risk it all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
To risk it all. He said to risk it all?,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Yes. Is... there something significant about that phrase?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"When last he said to risk it all, to me... I didn't listen to him, then. But should have. I should have.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
He's asking you to take another chance.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No... he's giving me another chance, I think. I... leave me lad, for now. Thank you for telling me.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"About risking it all, sir. Did you come to any decision about what that meant? What you should do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm getting there, lad. In battle, I would operate on instincts, make snap judgments almost instantly. In other matters, though... I need some time. Your patience, please. I'll let you know if I can figure something out.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
You have my thanks.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I need your help with something, lad. As I'm about to risk it all, I think. Will you hear me out?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Of course, sir, what is it? I'm listening.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The pact I signed with your father. It must be buried somewhere down in the administrative chamber there. I dared not ask that you locate it, out of fear that tampering with it would only make things worse, except...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"...Except that fear is for the weak, Achilles, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Indeed. Besides... your father has been more abiding than I expected with how you were able to nullify the Knave-King's Sentence... so, perhaps my case isn't a lost cause, yet.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"I'll speak with Nyx about it the next chance I get. And I'll be careful, sir. I promise you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You have my thanks.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"I'll speak with Nyx about it the next chance I get. And I'll be careful, sir. I promise you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm working on trying to find your pact, Achilles. Just need a little more time to sort it out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've nothing if not patience, lad. And I shall try to keep my hopes in check. Thank you for your effort around this. When next we speak of it, may it be when you've succeeded.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"Farewell for now, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Achilles! Your pact with Father is officially amended, sir. Specifically, it no longer has any stipulation barring you from entering Elysium during the indefinite term of your employment. On my authority in the name of Hades, thank you for your service.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, are you... you're serious. I'm able to go. You're right, I feel it. I'm unbound. So I can... simply leave... right now.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You can simply leave, right now. And, might I add... it's about damn time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I... should get going then, although... I am unprepared, I... didn't think it would come to this. Not that I had no faith in you, it's just...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Incidentally, there's this one glade out in Elysium I highly recommend... go to him, sir. You've waited long enough. Fear is for the weak.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Fear is for the weak. Farewell for now, lad. I can't thank you enough.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Count on it, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sir, you're back! How was it in Elysium, was everything all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It went well, lad. As well as I could have hoped. Better than I might have feared. Hey, don't take Patroclus calling you 'stranger' personally, all right? He has less charitable terms for those he doesn't care for.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Come on, Achilles, I want details, here! What happened with you two? If you don't mind.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahah, well. Thankfully, your efforts meant that no words really needed to be said, when I arrived. He simply said my name. Then, we just... were. Two souls together in one spot. The way shades linger, it looks mournful, right? But it isn't always.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
That's wonderful to hear. He seemed uplifted in your presence. You must have lots of catching up to do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Lots of making up for lost time. And finally we have some time to spare. It's odd, because so many of my memories of him are from a time of war. Now, we can make new memories in peace. Anyway... see you out there again sometime, I hope?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Thank you!!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What is it, lad, what's wrong? What can I do?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Let me in Father's chambers. Please.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...That's high atop the list of things I'm not to do, for anyone, and under any circumstances. What is it you need? I've never even been in there, myself...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I don't know, I don't know! But, if I know Father, and I think I do, he's got to have something of hers in there. Of Mother's! She still doesn't get it, doesn't believe me about him, and... I said I'd prove it. That he cares for her!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, slow down, I understand. Look... this can get me in a lot of trouble, like you've no idea. And, not just me, so... be careful, and be quick, while he's still out. Take this and go. Don't leave anything there out of place, all right?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Just watch yourself.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles... if a friend of yours were in need of assistance, but the only way you could assist them was to somehow change the terms of an ancient pact Father probably forced on them, what would you do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I would be very careful, above all. Do you understand, lad? I would not wish to make things any worse. How many pacts such as the one you're thinking of are buried back in the administrative chamber, there? Even your father can't keep track. Although... perhaps Nyx can.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Nyx... you're right. She knows everything! Wouldn't hurt to ask her, I suppose...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Appreciated, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hold, lad! You've regained access to the administrative chamber, right? I never thought you'd want to go in there again.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, believe me, I don't. But I would like to be able to go where I please around here, and confounding Father is another benefit.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"I know you mean well, lad. And, from the bottom of my heart, where once it was, I thank you truly for the thought. However... don't exert your influence on this. Not now, at least. The Fates can twist intentions. I don't want to take the risk.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
You're sure...? Well then... I'll wait. But I am going to ask you again. We have to find a way to fix this. Patroclus is waiting.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Say, I was wondering, Achilles. Any news of Orpheus of late? I've not seen him around here in some time. He still paying his dues?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That I believe he is, lad. Your father, he was none too pleased with him last time I saw him here. I tried my best to simmer down the situation, but... you know how it goes. I hope your father cuts his sentence short.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I hope so, too. If you do see him, tell him I said hi.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Interesting.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Good to see old Orpheus is back with us. He hasn't changed a bit. Was he always like this?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm guessing not. Never knew him when we were alive, but since we met he's always been the melancholy sort. The few times I heard him sing, though...? It was beautiful. I'm not surprised your father's kept him here.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

...What would you have me do?,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I shall be giving it some thought. Until then, you just watch that hall. And watch yourself, as well.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Yes, Master. Thank you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Sometimes the law is not so bad.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I understand the terms of your employment have been altered in my name, Shade. Be grateful that you lack the standing for such changes to require my personal approval. Though you remain in my employ, correct?",CHARACTER,Hades,male

"I see. That's fine. But you will need to face your fears someday, in all of this. You act as if you can't afford to get involved, but it's a little late for that.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Of course, Mistress, I shall. By your command.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"...You found him after all? Because of Zag? That's... how very fortunate for you, Shade.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Mistress, for certain it is more than I deserve. Although, perhaps it's for the best that a forgotten shade ought to be put out with the rest of them. I shall not cause you so much trouble, then.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

I'll keep an eye on things while you're away.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male

Fight as though you've but one life to live.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Fight like I'd fight out there.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male

There's nothing you cannot achieve. I'm sure of it.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Do not throw away your life as I did mine, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
It brings me joy knowing you've found something worth fighting for.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"You have a good heart, lad. Keep listening to it.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
The Shade here was just regaling me about a famous war.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female

"This really is for me? You beat me to it, then, as I had meant to give you this when next we spoke. Please, take it.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"No, this is for me? You really shouldn't have. You're spoiling me rotten...!",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I just happen to think you deserve better than you've got down here, Achilles.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What, for me...? I can't accept something like this, lad, you know that.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Come on, Achilles, live a little... such as you're able. I won't tell if you won't tell.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, now this is something, lad! I'd hate to think that you've returned to bring me this just for my sake. Though I'm grateful, really.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You've always been there for me, Achilles. Even when Father pushed me away. This is nothing. I don't think I can ever repay you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Lad, all this generosity, I... don't want you to get the wrong idea. I am alone, yes, but my heart belongs to another. Ever since I was alive. I hope you understand.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I... somehow knew that was the case, Achilles. I wanted you to have this, anyway, just... don't drown your sorrows, as they seem to make you stronger.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thank you, then, and do not worry about me. I am long since past my sorrow, and the rage I felt when first my heart was broken. Now it's but another scar. They say it's our scars that give us character.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Other way around.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Lad, all this generosity, I... I'm just an old killer, yet you treat me like I'm the one who's royalty around here. That's about the last thing I would have expected when first I set foot in this House.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You were a great hero, Achilles, and guess what? You still are! And always will be if you ask me. You deserve so much better than just this. I wish there was more that I could do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thank you, then, and do not worry about me. I'm fortunate to be here, and besides... a teacher couldn't have asked for a better pupil.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, I was wondering if you'd split this with me at the lounge. A small excuse for both ourselves to take a break?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Are you most certain you have time for me now, lad...? Though, how could I decline. I'll see you there.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"...I was a fool, you see. The gods promised me eternal glory beyond death. I could have stayed out of the war. Stayed home with Patroclus. I threw everything away. And sent so very many to this place.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"What's done is done, sir. In my mind you're the greatest warrior who ever lived. So is it glory you still seek, or is it Patroclus?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It isn't glory anymore, lad. I'm sure of that. Patroclus, however, I... fear he's gone to me, forever. Although his shade might yet reside within this realm, we left on terms I'd not forgive if I were him. Though... I had better get back to my post now, I think.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
AchillesIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...I hope I didn't cast a greater pall over this place back there. I'm very thankful that we had this chance to get caught up. Now you had best be off! Take care out there.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Achilles, next time you're in Elysium, I thought this might be something you'd enjoy. That you might share.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ambrosia... well I am honored, lad, truly. Although it's I who ought to be bestowing thoughtful gifts upon you, for what you've done for me, not the other way around. And, I happen to have one here, on Pat's and my behalf.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"It's hard to think of anybody more deserving of this than you, sir. So when next you are off duty, or whenever the occasion warrants, please, enjoy, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I suppose this must be what it's like to be a god, lad. Being shown affection such as this. And getting offerings! Are you quite sure?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Oh, I'm absolutely positive. I would never have been remotely prepared for everything I've had to face, if not for all your guidance. And, I don't just mean the violent stuff.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come now, lad. Admittedly I was quite good at it, but I was nothing other than a killer. I would be wary of all my advice, if I were you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"See, that's why you give such good advice, right there!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I mean it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Here, sir! To you, and to Patroclus. May the remainder of eternity more than make up for everything it took for you to come this far.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, thank you, lad. Prince. Zagreus. You really oughtn't have. In fact, I shall accept this from you once again, but not a bottle more.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Really? I mean... I meant no offense, of course, it's just... I thought you enjoyed this stuff, no?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We do enjoy it, quite a bit, in fact. But in Elysium... it's something to be earned more than accepted, and, well... perhaps in being there, a bit of our old pride is coming back.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Well, good. You have much to be proud of, Achilles. You're a great warrior. A great instructor. A great friend.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...If, indeed, I've something to be proud of, lad... it's that someone such as you can say a thing like that to me, and mean it.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"My word. How very kind of you to think of me with that there, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Least I can do for all your guidance, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, now this is something, lad. I'd hate to think that you've returned to bring me this just for my sake. Though I am grateful, really.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"You've always been there for me, Achilles. Even when Father pushed me away. This is nothing. I don't think I can ever repay you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"I'm going to be the envy of the House with this, I thank you, lad. I hope you wouldn't mind if I shared some of it around?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"It's yours, Achilles! Though not only do I hope you'll share it, why, I practically insist.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles might be in Elysium I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles must be with Patroclus now.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles is probably in Elysium.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles is off duty.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Must have missed Achilles.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Achilles on break I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You have a Chthonic Companion! And you're giving it to me?!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanks so much, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Come, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"No mood for sparring, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Not now, lad.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I've fought enough I think.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Rest while you're able.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male

Heh.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Ehh.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"No, thank you.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Yes. We are.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Then, go.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Do not despair, child. Such setbacks are inevitable, and may be overcome with effort, and with time. You made contact with the goddess Athena. She shall be true to her word.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The risk is not to me. I expected the Olympians would involve themselves in this, eventually. Reveal to them no more than they already know. Are we understood?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I see...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Glad there's no question anymore.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It pleases me to speak with you at last, child. So the goddess Athena was true to her word. You and she were wise to use discretion in your task.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
The risk was not to me. It was inevitable that the Olympians would involve themselves in this. The only question was how.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I trust that the Mirror in your bedchamber has proved satisfactory, dear child...?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Better than I could have possibly imagined, Nyx. You mentioned there was something more that it could do, once I had grown accustomed. I think I'm ready for that now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think you are, as well. Then, it shall be as you wish.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Before you go, my child... your father's mood is rather difficult right now. Perhaps just leave him be.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Oh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, this may be an odd question, but... do you know what the Fates may have in store for me? They are your daughters, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Three Fates are my daughters, yes, my child. However, I am no more privy to their workings than the naive mortals living up above. Not even the Olympians can know the weavings of the Fates.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Darkness guide you, child. You have outgrown this House, of that I am now certain. Should you return again here, I shall keep you safe.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I won't forget you, Nyx. I swear it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It is more than all right, my child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Somehow, I always knew. You know... that you were not my birthmother. I mean, look at Hypnos and Thanatos. There's no way that I could have been related to them, everybody knew, and yet... when I finally learned for certain, it was still a shock.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I always knew, in turn, that you would learn the truth of it, eventually. And I was fearful of what would occur after that time arrived. I'm grateful it has come and gone. Though, tell me. I still find I call you child. Is your preference that I cease to use such terms, from this point on?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"No, Nyx, please, it's... quite all right. You may not have given birth to me, but you still cared for me. I never doubt that. Likewise, are you sure it's all right that I continue to address you by name?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx, you must know something about why Father broke off ties with the Olympians, don't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That is a question only your father can answer, child. I cannot tell you more than you already know.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I'm sure we can reconcile our disagreements all the same.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I have to ask you something, Nyx. What is this debt you owe my father, anyway? Forgive my eavesdropping, it's just, I heard the two of you discussing things, and... it came up.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I was here long before your father. The responsibility to govern fell to me. Yet, I could not manage on my own. I shape the darkness; ensure the integrity of the domain. I am less prone to census-taking and administering rules. I receded from such responsibilities.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It was too much, even for you. So... when father arrived... you welcomed him? He helped?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was quite skeptical of him, at first. I thought his presence merely a cruel trick of Fate. But... he worked diligently, from the start. Soon there was order where once there was none. I fashioned this House for him, and I maintain it still. We remain in partnership. In interdependency.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
He has never taken advantage of you? Of your generosity?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No, child. He has not. He can be short with me, as you have seen. But that is the extent of it. We have found ways to reconcile disagreements. Though, your relationship with him... it is more complicated than my own, I fear...",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, all you've done to help me, with the Olympians, the Mirror, the House Contractor, I... I worry that if Father were to know, that he would turn his wrath upon you. I don't want anything to happen.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You need not fear for me, my child. For I am not some underling your father has authority to punish if it pleases him. I am the Night; and it is by my grace that this House stands. Your father knows this. Thus, he and I have certain common goals. We are obligated to cooperate.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Then... if there's really nothing he can do, why go along with his deception? About my birthmother, I mean?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Your father and I... sometimes convince ourselves.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I heard lately from the goddess Athena, Nyx. She seems to admire you. I thought Olympians didn't like our kind?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They typically do not. But, you are family, child. And I, why... I believed Athena wise enough to understand why someone such as I would seek her, in particular. She has, in turn, made others in her family aware.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Ah. I see. I guess. I think?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Athena sends you her kindest regards, Nyx. Sounds like you have maintained some correspondence since all this began?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We have, thank you, my child. Goddess Athena is reputed to be wise, and so she was the one I felt was the most likely to listen to reason, understand my view, and ultimately have a willingness to help. It is most fortunate that I was not mistaken about her.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
But... you told her you're my mother. If she's supposedly so wise... isn't that quite a risk? If she finds out you've been misleading her...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She is wise, child. It is precisely for that reason I expected she would understand.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Hmm.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

...Anytime...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Erm, Nyx, at first I thought I maybe should ignore this, but I wanted to give you greetings from Lord Ares, who seems rather interested in you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, yes, the god of war. Among all the Olympians, he often struck me as much more accepting of our kind, born of the Underworld.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You're not... wait, you're not interested in him, I mean, he's... murderous... polite, though, I don't know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I take an interest in whomever I take interest in, my child. I thank you for the message.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I like the positive attitude.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Nyx, erm, Lord Ares wanted you to know, and I believe I quote, that 'I am often thinking of her here'. Take that for what it's worth?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I shall, thank you, my child. If the god of war is thus preoccupied with me, well then, perhaps he shall be slower to send droves of mortals to our doorstep here.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I hear from them rather a lot, myself....",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Help me, Nyx. Or rather, help yourself. Lord Ares seeks for me to put the two of you in contact. I mean... I don't know why I'm getting so defensive, here, now that I think on it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do not concern yourself with my ability to navigate my interpersonal relationships, my child. It pleases me Lord Ares told you this. Those of Olympus rarely say such things, to any of us here.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Fair point.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, did you really start a correspondence with Lord Ares, as he put it to me recently? Is everything all right with you and him?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"His interest in the Underworld is genuine, and he does not regard me as beneath him, even if the technicality exists. The Olympians and the chthonic gods... we have much left to learn of one another's kind.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
What of Father? He's forbidden any contact whatsoever!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You do not understand the basis of our friendship, child. Lord Ares may not meet the moral standard of the mortals who hate him, or Olympians who shun him, but to me? He is cordial and eager to learn. I am quite capable of forming my own views on him.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Erm, Nyx, I... Ares sends you his regards again. Wanted to let you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

I won't.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Olympians can't really see me, can they, Nyx? I mean, not very well. I get that they can sense details here and there, but... they don't know the full extent of what's going on. Are we really so far beyond their influence?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are enshrouded from them, child. For your own benefit, and theirs. They know as much as necessary to assist. And I trust they shall, for as long as you require. They are bound to one another as family. And they know that you require aid. Do not be too prideful to accept.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I was pleased to see an order pending approval for the release of Orpheus with the House Contractor, Nyx. If Father wants him to start singing again, locking him in Tartarus doesn't seem like the most efficient way to go about it. Besides, I think he's suffered enough.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Your father's temperament is easier to navigate when he is in relatively better spirits. And my opinion is that punishing the court musician does not further your father's goal with him.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Do you enjoy Orpheus' singing, Nyx? He seems a bit concerned that you might not.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I am amenable to the consonance of his harmonies, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I don't suppose the name Skelly happens to mean anything to you, does it, Nyx?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It means nothing to me at all, my child. Though, why do you invoke such names within this House? Who is this Skelly, and what do you presume is the connection that exists between us?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, I... well, essentially, he is an animated skeleton who shows up just outside my bedchambers, and lets me practice with my weapons on him. I sort of figured that you put him up to it. So it wasn't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Achilles moves throughout these chambers under my own shroud, if you must know. And thus you have in your possession the Infernal Arms. But, I have not exerted further influence than that. Is this skeleton to be trusted, then?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I finally made it to the surface, Nyx! Confronted Father, there, out in the cold. I couldn't make it past him, but... I was so close!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do not despair, as I told you before. With effort and with time, most any setback can be overcome. Even your father. You have come closer to your goal. Achieve it!",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Your father is not here, and you are back. Then, it can only mean one thing. Are you all right, my child?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Yes, I think so, Nyx. Returning here by Father's hand does put a special sting into it, though. So, any invaluable tips on how to vanquish him? Some hidden weaknesses only you know about, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know his weaknesses better than anyone. Better even than he. It pains me to know that the conflict between you could not be settled in some other way. But if this is how it has to be... destroy him for me, next you fight up there. However long it takes. Would you do that?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You have been served a Pact of Punishment, now, child. I thought to talk your father out of it, at first, but... it may serve to let you grow your power, even more.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Something about setbacks building character, I guess? I didn't take you for someone to look on the bright side of things, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is a point of fact. If you can overcome the conditions of the Pact, your influence throughout this realm shall surely grow. Though, do not overextend, of course.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I thank you for the lovely flowers, child. They make my corner of the House hospitable. Such simple comforts never were for me, and yet... now that I am surrounded by them, I have found that I enjoy their presence, more than I would have admitted in the past.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I'm glad you like them, Nyx. Though if you don't, just give the word, and I will have them removed. Probably incinerated for good measure! Now that you mention it, though, how come you are always in this corner in particular?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This point is closest to the center of the House. To its foundation. And, therefore, to the center of the entire realm.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't you ever get lonely down here, Nyx...? For companionship, I mean, because... I mean, just look at you, you're very beautiful, the night herself! There's nothing you can't do. When I was younger, I thought you and father, you know, but... is there not someone else?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How very forward of you, child. I accept your compliment. Although, I am the Night, as you observe. The night conceals all. I know nothing of the loneliness which you describe. This entire realm... it is a part of me. And many of its subjects sprang from me, alone.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You appear to have grown stronger since when last we interacted, child. Your bedroom mirror may appear to be the cause... but then of course the real cause is you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I sense the growing darkness in you, child. I am so very proud of you. You always have been capable, yet now, you seem to radiate with newfound power.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"The unfathomable power of the Underworld thrives within you, child. Your godliness has grown since last we spoke; you have learned much of harnessing the dark.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Huh. I suppose.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Even among those born longest ago within the deepest reaches of the Underworld... I have seldom encountered anyone so united with the Darkness of this domain as you are, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"United with the Darkness? I've just... been picking it up here and there. Although, for quite a while, since you mention it! I'm not sure that I feel any different, though.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Surely that is not so. Think back on when you started all of this. You now know so much more. Are capable of so much more.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You really think so?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Yes.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You have revealed every facet of the Mirror of Night, child. The full extent of its power. I was aware this was possible, yet... you achieved it sooner than expected.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I don't know where I'd be without it. Probably still in Tartarus trying to get past Meg. I only wish I could get even stronger.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Mirror has little to do with your power, let alone your capability. You may deactivate its effects and see for yourself. It merely gave you greater opportunity to learn. And you shall continue to do so.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx... I have to ask you something. Are you certain that my search isn't in vain? My mother, what if... what if she's gone?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your mother yet lives. There can be no other explanation. For, if she did not, she would be with us, here.... She was a good woman. Stately, kind. I wished to raise you as I thought she would have.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, sometimes I get the impression the Olympians look down on those of us born of the Underworld. Is that my imagination, or, what do you make of it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The gods of Mount Olympus tend to think themselves above us, child. Or so your father often likes to say. He alone was relegated to this realm, and grew resentful of his relatives on high.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
It's getting complicated pretty fast...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You have met most of your Olympian relatives by now, child. Although the power of their blessings is fleeting here, they shall continue to support you. As long as necessary.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
They all still think I'm headed to join them on Olympus. That's why they're helping me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
They are helping you because you are family. Family with whom they do not yet have a complicated past.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
...Understood.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx... the Olympians have been immensely helpful, but... did they really have to get mixed up in all this? I could have gone off on my own.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And you would not have gone far, child. Your father is too proud to accept assistance in personal matters. Do not cede the advantage that you have.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
But I'm misleading them. Taking advantage of their good graces trying to find Mother. What if they find out?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I shall do everything within my power to prevent this, as shall you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I... I trust you Nyx. I do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, can you... tell me more about my birthmother? Anything at all. What was she like, when you first met? What did you think of her?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your birthmother left a strong impression on us, child. It was apparent she was from a far-off place, and yet... she brought with her a lightness I had not experienced before. My first impression soon subsided, and I grew to care for her. You possess many of her finer qualities.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Finer qualities? Such as abandoning her family members? Why did she leave? Why won't you tell me?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Please... you must not ask such things of me. I swore a binding oath never to say. I have already circumvented it as much as can be done. Go find her, child. Then, you shall understand.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Thank you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, can you... tell me more about my birthmother? Anything at all. What was she like, when you first met? What did you think of her?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

My first impression soon subsided, and I grew to care for her. You possess many of her finer qualities.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I'll find her, then. I have to.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, if I can ever make my way from here, out to the surface... how do you know that I can find her? The instructions you gave me... how can you know for sure that's where she is, that she hasn't left, or...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"When your birthmother departed, I bent the light for her, shrouding her path, though I myself could see it. I trust she remains there, and that I am not betraying her confidence by telling you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
As mortals do...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Your father fell to you, as once his father fell to him. Although, you were substantially more merciful. I know it is a bitter victory, at best. Though, tell me... what transpired subsequently, that you have returned? Did you locate your birthmother?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I did, I... she was there. She was... where you said she'd be. And, more than I imagined, but... I had so little time with her. I can't survive up there, for very long. Why didn't you tell me I'd just die, no matter what?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, my child... I say this seldomly, but... I did not know. Or... I did not wish to believe... that the surface would have such an effect on you. But it seems you share your father's fate, after all.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My father's fate? But he is smugly waiting for me every single time I make it there, and seems quite healthy by then, all in all! Though... maybe the farther we get from this realm... the worse we get. Because he cast his lot... inheriting the Underworld?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So I now presume. You are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine. Tell me something... if you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time... would you still make the journey to her, there?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...Yes. Yes, I would. I had so many questions left for her!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, go and ask them, child. Steady your resolve, and find her there, again. And use well what brief time you have with one another, whilst you can. As mortals do.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

Urgh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nyx... why did you never send word to Mother that I lived? You knew at least approximately where she went. You and Father... you could have spared her so much pain!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I swore a binding oath never to say, child. I have already circumvented it as much as can be done. Know that we... that I acted with only her wellbeing in mind. As well as yours.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
...Thank them for me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nyx... you saved my life. Gave me life. When I was born. Father told me. I don't know what to say. Why didn't you tell me?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There are many things that I am not at liberty to speak of, child. Through my own binding choice. These circumstances are among them. Suffice it to say that your revival... required the extent of my ability. And considerable time.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I never should have been born... is that what the Fates wanted? Did you defy your own daughters?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Silence. Tempt not my daughters thus.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
They are.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How is she, child? Queen Persephone, I mean. Has she been well up there, in her abode? What is it like?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"She's doing well, I think. It's nice to visit her. Her residence is beautiful. A little home nestled amid the cold. All of these plants, in bloom! It's difficult even to describe. And very bright, as well.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That sounds quite pleasant for someone who values brightness, I suppose. Well, then... I trust your visits are worthwhile for the both of you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I'll be careful...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, my mother was quite concerned to learn Olympus has been aiding me. Did you... haven't you... put her in danger by involving them? Was there no other way?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No. There was not. She has been in danger, all along. I concealed her, yes. Even from me. But, it is not enough. I do not think that you could have found her without the Olympians. And, if I did not reveal your existence to them... if they discovered who you are... it would be worse.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Ugh, what a mess. How are we going to fix this?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Olympians maintain belief that you are trying to reach them. I trust we can sustain this understanding for a long, long time. Perhaps not forever, but... long enough to discover a solution. Perhaps with your birthmother's help.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You've said more than enough. I'll see you, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Child, quickly now, before you go. I know how all of this must look. Know that I was true to her. Persephone. And, that I think fondly on the time she spent with us.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Of course, Nyx, though... why did she really leave the Underworld, do you think? Besides because of me. So what if she thought I died at birth?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
She did not feel that she belonged. It was a very difficult adjustment she was forced to make. And... she feared that she would inevitably end up caught between Olympus and this realm. That she might start a war.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"A war... wars have been fought for less, I understand. And, Father must have been a real burden, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You do not know. Ask her yourself, about her time with him. But... I have already said too much. And I cannot say more.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Good.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"What is the matter, child? I sense your distress, not the specific cause.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Mother doesn't want to see me again. I mean... she asked me not to return. Thinks the risk is too great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Oh. That is a fair-enough assessment. What shall you do?,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
...I'm going back.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"She did, did she...",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Father loved her, didn't he? Mother, I mean. Faith like that... he's just stubborn enough to hold onto the idea of her, isn't he? Though, what she saw in him, I'm not sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your father was different with Persephone, to some extent. He has always been as you know him, yet... her lightness... it affected even him, I think. And he knows... that he was better with her, than without.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Sounds like a lot of pressure on Mother to fix all his failings... but, it sounds as though she cared for him, as well. And you, and Cerberus. She said she misses you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I guess obscurity does have its perks.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, why is it the mortals come here knowing all about Olympus, while knowing so little about what goes on in our realm? Is there something more we could be doing to help spread the word?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This realm remains enshrouded and obscure by my design and by your father's will, my child. Tell me, what would be the benefit of the attention you would seek?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, I... I don't know, it's just, for all the famous gods and monsters and the like, it seems to me that someone such as you, who does so much, why... you should be at least as known as any one of them!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Obscurity is not a weakness, child. Are we understood? Seek to be valuable, not to be known. If you are valuable, then fame or notoriety can be a consequence. Should they become a burden... I can help.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You have encountered setbacks within Asphodel, have you not, child? The Bloodless shades residing there are eager to bring death to any form of life. Beware of their infernal power.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You have confronted the Exalted Shades within Elysium, my child. Your father offers them a handsome bounty should they bring your journey to an end. Although, I think the pride of vanquishing you would more than suffice in getting them to take up arms again.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Do as you must. Your victory is within reach.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You nearly gained the surface, child. Considerable progress. Though, the setbacks that you faced within the Temple... if it is of any consolation, the foes you faced there have been quite a burden to your father, too.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"What, Father can't control the pest problem? Never thought I'd be of any help rampaging through the upper levels of his domain.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I saw you took possession of the List of Minor Prophecies, of the Three Fates. As ever, I should never have doubted my daughters' expectations. I was uncertain you had necessary guidance to select it from among the House Contractor's many opportunities.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You offer something called the Fated List of Minor Prophecies to me, chances are I'm going to pick it up. Though, you make it sound like there's more I should know about it. Should I be concerned?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know exactly what is necessary, and no more. I know better than anyone never to tamper with the Fates' design. Though, if they had cruelty in store for you through their List... I think that I would warn you, anyway.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You have fulfilled already many prophecies envisioned by my daughters, child. Although perhaps inevitable, I find it impressive, nonetheless.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Thank you, Nyx. Though, they're just minor prophecies, right? The kind that won't necessarily come to pass unless spelled out and coupled with a decent reward to make it worth my while. Not even the Fates are above greasing the wheels of progress, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Fates have perfect knowledge of exactly what is necessary for the future they have woven to someday come to pass. We each are instrumental to their ultimate design. Some more than others, it would seem, of course.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I sense all of the minor prophecies described within the Fated List have been fulfilled...? I do not understand how that is possible.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Well, it certainly took some doing, and several of those really were rather difficult, and took some time, but... what's so special about getting through them all? It's a list, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Fates are always at their weaving. To have caught up with their designs... well, I should think that they shall have to learn to weave a little faster, perhaps.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah. Yes, no need to speak of it again. Though, I am pleased to oblige.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Probably my mother's.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This House is not a place of cheer, child. A certain severity always struck me as appropriate, if not necessary, given our role.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Is this about all the House Contractor decorations? Look, it's one thing if Father objects, but if you do as well... just tell me, and I can have it taken down.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You misunderstand. I am grateful. These changes... I would not have commissioned them, myself. But, seeing them now... I appreciate their presence. You have a discerning eye.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, if, hypothetically, I felt that some injustice had been dealt to someone who deserved a better lot... say, that they were subjected to too harsh a punishment for all eternity... don't I have some of my father's authority to do something about it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now that you have regained your access privileges to the administrative chamber, child, yes; that is a level of authority you hypothetically possess, again.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
But how can I possibly find anything in there? The place is wall-to-wall pacts and parchments. I've no idea where to look.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You can be made aware. Though, use discretion, if and when you need to exercise this power. And make certain that the time is right. Now, are we understood?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Never thought that the administrative chamber would have been so invaluable, Nyx. Though, I have you to thank for all of it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nonsense, child. Our records must be kept up-to-date. You merely observed that several were long past due. Not even your father can argue with that.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Nyx... I encountered Demeter. She mentioned her daughter... Persephone. You never said she was my grandmother. Didn't you think... under the circumstances... that was something I should know?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Listen to me, child. What you know, or do not know, is for your protection. Your protection, and your birthmother's, as well. Your suspicion and your curiosity are warranted. But I can do no more about them, now, except to caution you. Are we understood?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, I've come to know the god of swiftness, Hermes, though... it seems to me he doesn't work directly with the others on Olympus. Do you know him well?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Lord Hermes is a point of contact, yes. Among Olympians he works the closest with our operations here, and aids with shepherding the souls of the departed to our gates. Accept his help; for he is faithful to our cause.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Well I think you did great, if you ask me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Someday I'd like to meet more of your children, Nyx. Eris, Nemesis... Thanatos told me of several others. Have they ever visited the House?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No. They are required elsewhere. It is for the best. Some of my children are not on speaking terms with one another, or with me. As a mother... one has her victories, and her defeats.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, I was just busy doing some administrative chamber record-keeping recently, and, wouldn't you know, it somehow slipped my mind where I could find the sentencing parchmentwork for the knave-king Sisyphus, forced to toil out in Tartarus? I ran it by Megaera...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He has offered you aid, repeatedly. At first I saw it for a brazen act of bribery, but... try as I might, there was no deeper underpinning to his actions that I could detect. That is to say... the records you seek may be found in section sigma-phi-alpha, lower gamma folder.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I waived the punishment-sentence for Sisyphus the knave-king, Nyx, except... he chose to stay! He chose to stay, in Tartarus, I think in part because he likes getting to speak with me, from time to time! Also his boulder friend.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

"Erm, Nyx, you ever have a burning urge to find the case files for the circumstances under which our court-musician bound himself to eternal servitude here in this House, and forever lost his opportunity to be with his beloved muse?

ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You need not thank me, child. Your actions made this outcome possible. I merely did what anyone in my position would have done.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I, ah, happened to be looking into our security situation here, just running background checks, that sort of thing, and... I was wondering if you could help me locate an old pact signed by... signed by Achilles, Nyx. It would mean a lot... not just to him, but me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Achilles... We would struggle to put someone comparable in his role. Though, be that as it may... epsilon-iota-theta. Rho folder, middle, I believe. You are certain about this, child?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I can see them, my child, and I have. And it pleases me Achilles has earned some degree of respite from his servitude, for all his loyalty to our House. For what you have done for him, thank you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Father isn't going to be thrilled I've let him out of a binding pact.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your father is committed to his rules, and you released Achilles from his pact according to those rules. There is not much that even he can do about it save to have Achilles sign again.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Together, let us find out.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Sounds good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Persephone, the Queen... she has returned! I scarce believe it, child. You have brought her back, to all of us.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I scarce believe it, too. What happens now? Pick up the pieces and begin again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think so, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How has it been for you of late, Nyx? Having Mother here again, for old time's sake?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Though reminiscent of an older time, it is now very different, child. For one thing... you are present, now. Unlike before.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, right. So, are you getting on OK, is everything all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Everything is all right. Your birthmother... Persephone... her presence has been welcome here, I think.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Likewise, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Congratulations on your new responsibilities, my child. So, you have reason to rise from here to the surface, still.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It's more of a formality, I think. My responsibilities, such as they are, remain quite similar to those that got me to this point. But thank you, Nyx. It's strange... to think that I can serve the House, by trying to break from it, time after time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
There can be no escape. Your father wishes that this reputation spread. So that the mortals and the shades never attempt what you were able to achieve.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Well, it does beat standing around in my chambers aimlessly. And... I daresay it feels rather good not to feel utterly incompetent, for a change.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is an honor to be working with you, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Elaborate plan, then. Got it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, meant to ask... Charon was there to take Mother and me home the one time. So is he... has he been working for you? All part of some elaborate plan, or something?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Charon serves only this realm, child. And, he is very trustworthy. I suppose that it is also possible he has some affection for the Queen, if not for you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Truly...?,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You are still in a difficult predicament, my child. And I, with you, in turn. Those on Olympus think you seek them, even now. That you are my own son by birth. Our deception, well intentioned as it was, has multiplied in size.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
You're right. We have to do something. We can't just keep pretending with them.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But if you reveal to them the truth of everything... I fear the wrath they shall unleash. Perhaps not all of them, but some, at least, shall not take such deceptions well.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I couldn't agree more. Fortunately, Mother has a plan! Asked me to get in touch with everybody on Olympus, one by one.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Your birthmother is resourceful, certainly. Though can you say as yet, which sort of plan?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Would you believe it if I told you she wants to have all of them over for Ambrosia?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
As long as it's OK.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, this feast Mother has planned... would it be all right with you if I were to invite Chaos?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I... hardly think that Chaos would attend any festivity of ours. I am uncertain that they even could. Even more doubtful that they would want this. However... if you truly wish to ask, proceed.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
A sound idea.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It was a privilege to meet your relatives at last, child. Athena, Ares, and the rest. Confronted face-to-face, they were much more agreeable than I expected. A night we shall remember, was it not?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"A memorable night it was, indeed, Nyx! For most of us, at least. Dionysus, he won't remember any of it, I don't think. But, it was really good to see everyone having a good time. Getting along as though they didn't hold a grudge! So, then, we're clear, I think?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Persephone told them everything they needed to hear. Sometimes that is the only way, with family. Though, the Olympians... they are prone to their misunderstandings, are they not? This state of kinship may not last eternally.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Well, let's enjoy it while it does, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Pride has been the failing of so many mortals, child, and has brought low members of your family, as well. And yet... I am so very proud of you, for what you have achieved. I wanted you to be aware of that.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"That means a lot to me, Nyx. Though I never could have done any of this without your help. Even after I lashed out at you after I learned the truth about Mother, you never stopped caring for me... and you put yourself directly in harm's way, defying Father's will. Why do all that, for me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I am eternally committed to this House. Long before your father came to rule, I was already here. When he arrived... I needed to do everything I could to keep order, and establish with Lord Hades an agreeable relationship. But, there is one more reason, besides that...",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"To get on better terms with the Olympians. They always used to frown on the Underworld, but... now that they know us, they seem much more willing to get involved and help with things.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A reasonable guess, and not without some truth to it, but no, my child. My reason for helping you is simpler than that. It is because I love you. You may not be born of me, but I raised you like one of my own. And I have cared for you as I am capable.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx... I love you, too. Thank you for everything.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"She has departed once again. Your birthmother the Queen. Although, it was not as difficult to see her off, this time. Knowing she shall return.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
It must be difficult for her... returning to Olympus. She had no love for it at all. I hope she'll be all right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do not despair. We have ways of watching over her. Not that I expect anything untoward to happen, but... well, with your family, one learns to take precautions, as you know.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
...I'll miss her.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So shall I. But it shall not be long, I think.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Of course!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I was pleased to see even Chaos was able to attend our little feast there with the Olympians, in spirit, anyway! Were you able to chat at all?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Only a little bit. The first communication we have had in quite some time. It went better than expected. Perhaps they and I can continue the conversation at some point. Thank you for your initiative, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Well, let's enjoy it while it does, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Alas, you have seen much of Hypnos lately, child. I hope you find his disposition somewhat tolerable? Please tell me plain if this is not the case.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, he's not so bad, Nyx. Be proud of your sleepy, cheerful son! Who else among us is able to muster that kind of enthusiasm?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't often see you interact with Hypnos, Nyx, so I just wanted to make sure... is everything all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hypnos still is learning independence, child. Thus, I have decided it is best to keep my distance from him temporarily, else he shall continue to rely upon me, even for completing the most rudimentary requests. We have agreed he shall not call upon me for the time being.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"For the time being? How long are we talking? Can't remember the last time I saw you speaking with him, now that you mention it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Based on his rate of progress, I suspect his education shall have been complete well before the dawning of the next age.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, have you seen Charon lately? Everything all right with him? I can never tell how he's doing.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Charon and I have not lately taken opportunities to correspond. But he has always been among the least dependent of my children, other than perhaps only the Fates. This much I know and can assure to you: He always is content to steer his boat.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I suppose you are the one to thank for his assistance, when it comes to selling me his wares and such.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
No. He is the one to thank. Do not mistake his lack of speech for lack of cleverness. He serves this House as I do. But he does not answer to me.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"A friendly rivalry it is, then!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Erm, Nyx? You don't suppose Charon would hold it against me if... we had a little fight? To the death, I mean.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"None of Charon's brothers ever dared fight with him whilst growing up. Why would you fathom such a ruinous idea, child?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It... kind of already happened. And, I can confirm he's rather strong. Something I can do to make it up to him?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Probably not. For it is unnecessary. Likely he appreciates having an adversary, in his own way. Few would so much as dare.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You must have vanquished Megaera, my child, for she has been sulking in the lounge for quite some time. You are safe here from her whip, but not her words.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I'd better talk to her. Thank you for the heads-up, Nyx. See you later, I'm sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You must have vanquished Megaera, my child. For she has been sulking in the corner there for quite some time. You are safe here from her whip, but not her words.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I'd better talk to her. Thank you for the heads-up, Nyx. See you later, I'm sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I understand. I think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, do you know anything about a softly-spoken gentlebeing under the guise of Chaos? They approached me recently, and offered me a Boon, of sorts.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Primordial Chaos... indeed, I know them well. They must have taken interest in your quest. I would advise that you beware their offerings, though know that Chaos, whilst a trickster, is not a deceiver.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Can you tell me something more of Chaos, Nyx? I... have a lot of questions.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My place is not to speak too openly of Chaos, child. It is their own prerogative to tell you of themselves. I can say they are the eldest force within this world. Before them, there was nothing.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Chaos seems to have taken somewhat of a liking to me, Nyx. They mentioned you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They mentioned me, did they... I thought, perhaps, that they had long forgotten. You should know they are my mother and my father, child. We have not spoken since the dawn of time.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx, I hate to be a bother, but I wanted to ask you about Chaos once again. Won't you at least try to reach out to them?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is for Chaos to reach out to me if they wish to reacquaint themselves with me. Child, it would please me if we spoke no more of this for now.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Child, I... know not exactly what you did, but... I detected faintly an attempt by Chaos to reach out to me. A message, merely at the edges of my consciousness, yet I felt certain it was there. But I could not discern it, otherwise. What does Chaos want from me?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I... think Chaos wishes to reestablish contact with you, Nyx. The two of you drifted apart from one another, so, I think I can imagine. I lost touch with Thanatos awhile! But that was nothing in comparison to this. Isn't there someway you can reconnect?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now that the House is strong, and this realm orderly, I do not know. But I shall think upon it, child. Leave me, please.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
So shall it be.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I know what must be done, regarding Chaos and myself, my child. It is not often that I ask for your assistance, but I need for you to do something for me, if you would hear me out.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Of course, Nyx. Anything. What can I do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"In the administrative chamber, you perhaps recall the Eldest Sigil there. Through it we have access directly to the darkest reaches of the realm. But not to Chaos, anymore. Not currently. Though, this is solvable, I think.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Wait, the Sigil? But I'm not authorized to use it. It's never worked for me, and I have even less authority around here now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That you were stripped of your authority is what makes this possible at all. It shall require a significant expenditure of Darkness. Then... the bridge to Chaos may be restored. So that I might travel again to visit them. Will you bring Darkness to the Sigil for me, please? When possible.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I'll do everything I can. Hey maybe you can put in a request with the House Contractor for me? Make it official, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"At last. The bridge to Chaos is restored. Thank you so very much, my child. I shall be going, then. And I shall presently return. Please, have no fear. And now, farewell. I shall bring Chaos your kindest regards.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, you're back! So, how did things with Chaos go? Please tell me it went well?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It did. It did go well, my child, I... appreciated having had a chance to reconnect with my great ancestor. Thanks to your generosity, to both of us. We had to make up for a great deal of lost time.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"So what happens now? You're back on speaking terms, then... does it mean Chaos will stop by for a visit soon, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Chaos is comfortable in their realm. I may, however, visit every now and then. Keep them apprised of what unfolds up here. Beyond that... Chaos knows better than to exert too much influence upon this realm. Beyond having already formulated it, and everything.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Not me!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How are you and Chaos getting on, lately, Nyx? Sounds like they expected an awful lot from you before. That you should shine as bright as day, something like that? I can't imagine.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"To shine was never quite my strongest suit. During the dawn of creation, there was much to do. This place... all that you see around you... it was more my leaning. Chaos understands that better, now. As for me, the work helped me to know which limits I have.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
What limits are those? You seem capable of anything. Probably even shining bright.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come, child. We each have our limits.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Fury Megaera is under orders to prevent your passage out of Tartarus, my child. Conflict between the two of you is unavoidable. It brings me pain to have to see you fight.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Don't say that, Nyx. Besides! Conflict between Megaera and me has always put the spark in our relationship. We're going to be fine.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Respectful. Definitely.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, you've known Megaera practically forever. Well, before my time at least, so could you... tell me more about what she was like, back then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Ah-hahah. I am pleased to see the two of you on better terms of late. Megaera always was as she appears. Dutiful and quite particular. Thoughtful and dependable. Respectful.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It pleases me that you and Megaera have come to deeply understand each other, child. I must admit to you, it was my hope that you and she were capable of this result.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You're pleased we're together, Nyx? I thought you'd be concerned that such relationships distract from work responsibilities and such. Although, I'm grateful to have your approval.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have no fear that Megaera shall be distracted, child. Besides; such matters are more likely to inspire, and to spur greater accomplishment. Although, the greater sense of contentment tends to be a sufficient end unto itself.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It pleases me that you and Megaera have come to deeply understand each other, child. I must admit to you, it was my hope that you and she were capable of this result.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You're happy Meg and I are friends now, Nyx? I appreciate it, certainly, though... I worry it might get in the way of Meg's ability to do her job.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have no such fear for either one of you. You both are dedicated to your tasks. I trust your friendship can withstand your confrontations every now and then. For that is why the friendship blossomed, is it not?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx... I ran into Thanatos out there. He aided me, although I think he's rather upset. That I took off like this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thanatos is worried for you, child. I hope you understand whatever anger you may sense from him is not the feeling at the source. Please forgive his rudeness.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Thanatos has finally come home. Have you not seen him, child? He has been very much preoccupied of late. It must have gladdened him to see you once again.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Then very well.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You and my son... it pleases me to see the two of you have grown so close of late. Thanatos has always led a solitary life. He never would complain of it, and yet... I know he yearned for closeness, in his way.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Thank you, Nyx. I think we each have harbored feelings for each other for some time. We've finally been true about them.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, in this you each achieved what you desired. I ask that you take care of my dear son. I often fear that he shall work himself too hard.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, he's all right. Though, I'll be sure to keep an eye on him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You and my son... it pleases me to see the two of you have grown so close of late. Thanatos has always led a solitary life. He never would complain of it, and yet... I know he yearned for closeness, in his way.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It's difficult to find a friend down here. Though, I have always had a trusted one in Thanatos, and he in me. I think we have a better understanding of that now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, may the bonds of your friendship last for as long as this House shall reign beneath the earth, here in the dark. Take care of my dear son.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Whatever you say...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What is it, child? I sense that your concern is of a different nature than it usually is. Yet, it is veiled to me, somehow.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, it's just.... Please don't take this the wrong way, Nyx, but I was worried you were being rather harsh to Dusa. You asked her not to speak to me, at all?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I asked she mind her own responsibilities. I fear she forgets herself, in this House. Though you have an informal air... you are the Prince! The only son of the Lord Hades, Fate-appointed master of this realm. You shall have the company of gods. Not severed gorgon heads.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Pff! If I'm so important, shouldn't I be the one to choose whom I get to interact with around here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You do not fully know your place, my child. The gorgon-head most certainly does not know hers. Please focus on your task at hand, and leave her be.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
She'll be fine. No one works harder than Dusa.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You are consorting with the severed gorgon head, my child. Despite my wishes that you maintain respectful distances between yourselves.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"She's my friend, Nyx. Look... I love you very much, you know I do, except... you cannot choose my friends for me! I can't allow that. I know you don't trust her. Don't you trust me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I do. Then, very well. But understand that your relationship with her does not preclude the need for her continual improvement with respect to her responsibilities.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I... rngh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What happened with Dusa, Nyx? You really fired her because she talked to me? She was my friend!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She was removed for insubordination, and repeated overextension and lack of proper judgment, child. Your affinity for her is the reason her removal was as amicable as it was.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Insubordination, and repeated lack of what? She worked harder than anyone here to keep the House neat and orderly! I'd thought you would have valued that!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusCosmeticPurchase,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Her eagerness to please was to a fault. Perhaps your Olympian relatives require sacrifices, child, but this House requires efficiency, and nothing more.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Efficiency... you know who you sound like right now, don't you, Nyx? I can't believe this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you are bent on undermining my authority, go do so someplace else.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Yes. We're understood...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx... I'm sorry that I raised my voice with you before, it's just... I cared about Dusa, and I know just how much she cared about working here, with you, and all of us... isn't there some way you would reconsider letting her go?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I appreciate that you have calmed yourself, my child. As for the gorgon head, this House needs steady-tempered vigilance, not unthinking devotion. Despite repeated feedback, she refused to approach any aspect of her duties with restraint.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Wait, you're saying you fired Dusa for working too hard? Did you give her any warning?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusCosmeticPurchase,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She did not understand how to work properly. Despite all that she did, she ultimately was a burden to this House. There was no warning necessary on my part.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Please give her another chance, Nyx. She can learn, she just needs to know what she did wrong. She gave this work everything. She just pushed too hard. Shouldn't something like that be forgivable?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...It seems you have more patience than I, child. And, I did not realize you cared. But do not ask again for me to rescind my decision. Are we understood?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
You'll be impressed. You'll see.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You really asked Dusa to come back. Thank you, Nyx! I'm very grateful. And Megaera. Probably everybody here! I'm sure she won't let you down.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know you care for her, child. And I admit I retain several concerns. Not only about the appropriateness of her conduct, but of her reckless inexperience. I do, however, see the possibility that she can work through these issues. Perhaps with your support.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I will. She'd do do the same for me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"At first, I was deeply concerned that you were spending so much time with Dusa, child. It seemed unbecoming for the both of you, and threatened to disrupt our custodian's routine. Except... it pleases me to say that, in this case, I was mistaken about you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Thank you for saying so, Nyx. Though, you mean you were mistaken about me, or about Dusa?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was mistaken about both of you. That you would influence her in a harmful way, yet here, in point of fact, she has performed her duties with increasing skill. That she would fail to perform her role, or to learn well from her mistakes. Please do continue to look out for her.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Hold, child. I have a message for you from my daughters, themselves. Concerning the Blade of the Underworld in your possession.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Wait, you mean the Fates? And Stygius? I'm honored that they would have taken any notice of me. What is it that they want for me to know?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They wish for me to impart to you these words, so that your blade, in turn, may hear them uttered from your lips: I see your kingly pardon from a prison of stone. Repeat them, and remember.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I see your kingly pardon from a prison of stone... this must be for one of the weapon's hidden forms. Please tell your daughters I am very grateful, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I shall, child. Although, I'm certain they already know. Though, whether they are aiding you or this is simply what must come to pass, I cannot say.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, the words you told me... when I spoke them to Stygius, the blade revealed to me the form of a great leader among men, taking counsel with his loyal retinue about a circular table. But if his reign is inevitable, why would the Fates need me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That I cannot say, child. It is peculiar having daughters who know every outcome that shall come to pass. It puts a strain on our relationship, and... I have learned never to ask they tell me more than they are willing to impart.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"You... you're... Nyx, you're not my mother. All this time, you and my father, you... you lied to me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, my dear child! So now you know...? So now you know. But, only half the truth. I can explain the rest, so, please.... It never was my wish to hurt you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
And I just adore them!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Nyx, I would have you know, I'm now proud owner of my very own Chthonic Companion! You really built them to last. Just... not very many of them, apparently. I'd all but given up on ever finding one.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I sensed this outcome, and it pleases me. Though, you never would have simply discovered such a thing. They each are unique artifacts that must be given willingly if they are to retain their shape, and power.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

Do not mistake them for their unassuming look. Within them is the strength of an unbreaking bond between two souls conjoined.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
That's very calculating when you put it quite like that...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, did you really give Dusa quite possibly the sole surviving epsilon edition Chthonic Companion in the entire Underworld? She's very grateful for it, so much so that she entrusted Fidi to my care. They grow in power that way, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The severed gorgon head is not without redeeming attributes, my child. Though, I expected this companion would soon find its way to you, the way the two of you have grown attached. Thus, in one action, both of you have found encouragement.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...You are not to aid him in these matters, Nyx; his foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded, not indulged. Do we have an understanding?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"We have an understanding, Hades, yes. He is your own son, after all, and therefore your responsibility. I, in turn, have my commitments to this realm, and to this House. You have aided me in them, so I remain, as ever, in your debt.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It is not necessary to remind me. Surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself would much prefer a post within my House over eternity within the lowest depths of Tartarus. Not that the darkness there would trouble you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...It is plain to me that you are helping him; in spite of my insistence you do not. What do you expect that I should do about this, Nyx? What would you do, in my position? Deception, in my very house and home...! Answer me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Hades, my relationship with him remains unchanged. It is the very same relationship from when you first requested I take care of him. He has my full support, and always shall. You must know this. He wishes now to leave. I shall make no attempt to stop him.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch. What good is any one of you? He's not even your son; and yet you coddle him. You know as well as I that he cannot succeed. You fill his mind with harmful delusions. If that is what you want for him, then, please! Proceed at pace.",CHARACTER,Hades,male

Nyx! Gah.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Olympus knows of him?! Bestowing on him all their worthless blessings, here, within my realm! Our realm! Explain to me how, exactly, this is possible, Nyx. Either your limitless power has considerably waned, or you are up to something.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Do not question my power, Hades. Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface. The Olympians are pleased to know they have a distant relative, and bid him welcome to their mountain. That is all. Their influence is very limited.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

Blood and darkness! Do not speak to me about their influence! I've seen their influence firsthand. You've made a foolish mistake.,CHARACTER,Hades,male

No! Of course not. She... seems content to be all on her own.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

You take his word for it? How can you trust him not to ruin everything?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Precisely how I trusted him to get us to this point.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
You have my gratitude.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
The honor is mine.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...What I attempt to tell you, Nyx, is I am grateful. For our long-standing collaboration, here. My rule was thrust upon you and your kin. By all rights, you ought have undermined my every move. I often thought you would. Yet once Olympus and I severed ties... you stood by me still.",CHARACTER,Hades,male

"I shall require no additional reminders. Know, in turn, that I shall always oversee this realm to the full extent of my ability.",CHARACTER,Hades,male

"...You raised him well, O Night. You know that, I hope? Though, I can't imagine even you could have expected this outcome. Thank you... for making all this possible. For all of us.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
AchillesIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are to thank for this outcome as much as I. Perhaps more so. For I have little choice but to serve this House. I was created in this realm, and it is everything to me. But you? Your loyalty could not have been assumed.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Oh, I don't know. I felt I had no choice, either, except to serve this House. At least at first. But in training the Prince... preparing him... I felt like I was living for something again. As strange as that may sound.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"Nevertheless, given the circumstances of your life and servitude, you need not have given so much of yourself. The greatness of your mortal days followed you into death.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Thank you, O Night.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"...I cannot ever repay you for what you have done, O Night. Know only that it is my honor to continue to serve at your pleasure, here.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

I do.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female

"Though your journeys take you elsewhere, still it pleases me to see you, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
My focus is on other matters at this time.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Please leave me to my current task at hand.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female

"Among my many children, both those born to me and surrogate to me, you are one of the most thoughtful and most generous of all.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

"Nyx, if you'll forgive me this transgression for a moment, I would like for you to have this vintage bottle of Ambrosia, please. You can hand it off to Megaera as contraband, but... just in case, I wanted you to have it, first.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Ah. A crystal bottle come all the way from the highest peaks of Mount Olympus to these depths within the earth. Your father always said he hated it.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Though, Father does have questionable taste.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, hahahaha. I accept this gift, with gratitude. This is a delicacy I have not experienced myself. Perhaps I may yet save it for appropriate occasions still to come. Thank you, my child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"By the way, I meant to tell you, child. The Ambrosia that you gave me? Rather than hold onto it indefinitely, I decided recently to sample it. Your father's claims about its flavor are quite false. I have never tasted anything like it.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"So glad you liked it, Nyx! And, good timing, too, because... I have for you another bottle, here. They say each one is different in its own respect! And besides, the pleasures of Olympus should be shared. Please, take it, won't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are persuasive like your mother, and determined like your father, child. But if you so insist, then I shall not deny myself the simple pleasures of this drink. Though rare is the occasion for it here.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I love you, too, my child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx, along with giving you this bottle of Ambrosia here, there's something I have meant to say to you. The Three Fates have been very kind to me. Because, in denying me my birthmother... they gave me you. Without your steady presence here, I... can't imagine what it would be like.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh. Then, the Three Fates are whimsical, indeed. When you were born, and I was filled with fear for what it meant for you to be alive, to be responsible for you... I must admit I did not guess that, one evening, you would provide for me both such a gift, and such a sentiment.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, I mean every word. I love you, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nyx might be with Chaos...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Maybe Nyx is with Chaos...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx is with Chaos, huh...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nyx isn't around.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nyx must be someplace else.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wonder where Nyx went.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm very grateful, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Is there something I can do for you, my child?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Is anything the matter, child?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Child?,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Mmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I am displeased.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
It is unwise to thusly anger me.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Please leave me be.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"My greetings to you, child. How unusual that we should come in contact here. Chaos and I had quite a bit of catching up to do. Please go about your business, and I shall see you back inside the House in time. Provided you return there, of course. And, thank you for this, once again.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Chaos and I have much catching up to do.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"How interesting to see you here, my child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Please go ahead and do not mind me, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Thank you for keeping Chaos company.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Go forth, bearing the mark of Chaos.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Chaos and I have so much left to discuss.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"It is comforting to be here again, in such darkness.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I shall see you back at the House soon, child.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
It is odd to have returned to where I was born.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"We are pleased to see you here, however briefly.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"As Chaos cannot visit us as easily, now I can visit them.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Some of us more than others.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Oh, hi! Um, welcome home! Again! Go right ahead! I think your dad's mad about something or other, though.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male

Great! Just keep dying over and over and everything will be fine.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's fun watching the Pool of Styx, you know? The ripples in the blood, and everything, and sometimes, somebody pops out of there, like you! House staff and guests of honor, no one else. I sign them in, and help make sure they have a pleasant stay!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ooh, why you made it all the way to Asphodel that time, that's pretty neat! Still died and everything but not as quickly as you used to, so, that's progress, right?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'm sure you can catch up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, wow, you did it! According to my list it says here you've died, what, fifty times at least! That's more than anybody's died around here, I think!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is a real honor, Hypnos. Thanks?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, let me be the first to say: Congratulations! You have died a hundred times since I've been keeping score. Since I've been keeping track. No prize for it or anything, but the journey is its own reward, or something, right?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Brilliant!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You're not going to believe this, here, you ready? Three.. hundred... times!! That's right! Three hundred times, you've died! That's like... more than an entire village from an earthquake, all on your own!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Six hundred?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Huh?,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Oh, I just can't believe it, although I know my list here never lies! And it says that you have died all of five hundred times! Five hundred!! I can't even think of a number higher than that!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's usually pretty quiet, keeping watch over the Pool of Styx back there. But it's sure been busy lately! Why, somebody else came through just earlier! You should have seen the look on my face when it wasn't you!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, you keep dying! You happen to run into my brother anywhere out there, by any chance? Haven't seen him in ages, what's with the long assignment?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Something about a war. Father sent Thanatos to take stock, but you're right, it's been a while now that you mention it. I guess a lot's occurred down here since then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'll say! The lounge re-opened, let's see, what else... Anyway! You see my brother out there you tell him we've got everything here under control!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hey, did you see? My brother, he's come back! He's here! Somewhere, I think! Good old Thanatos. He's so busy all the time, he... never talks to me! Kind of like your dad with you, I guess!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whaa! Oh, hah, you just startled me there, is all, I was just... um... I...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosWakeUp,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, uh, everything all right, there, Hypnos?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, absolutely! Everything definitely is. It's just... it's Thanatos. He said some stuff, and... now I'm not so sure I'm doing the best job I can, you know?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sure he wasn't trying to hurt your feelings. Wait, what am I saying, he's always been harsh with you, hasn't he?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, what if he doesn't like me anymore? He's got other brothers!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Aw, thanks Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh hey! Um, this might be a little weird, but I, uh... thanks! I mean, you talked to Thanatos about me, right? At first I thought he was acting funny. But he has definitely been a lot nicer to me, lately!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come on, Hypnos, I didn't have anything to do with that. You seem like you've been working extra hard, and taking some of the feedback you've been getting to heart. I think Thanatos really appreciates that sort of thing. Who doesn't?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I don't know! But I really appreciate that you went out of your way, I mean... I just stand here and greet and register the dead! But you? You're a real friend!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Whooooaaa.,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hey, there you are! So is it true?! You know, about you and Thanatos? Because he told me, and I just said, whooooaaa, but then, everything made sense?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sure whatever it is he said is completely true, yes, Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, did you see? Somebody got me this incredible new sleeper-seat right here! Though, I would never lie down while on the job! I'm perfectly all right sleeping while standing up!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Hypnos? What would it take for you to let me through the locked door down the hall?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, hahaha, that's a good one, you know I can't let you enter your dad's private chambers anymore, since you betrayed his trust and tried to run away from home! Sorry, Master's orders!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
We don't.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, did you see?! The Queen's come back! Though, did she ever take her sweet time!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hey watch it, Hypnos, that's my mother you're talking about!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, really? Huh! So then your mom doesn't spend any time with you, either! We've got something in common!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Why else?,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wait, wait, wait, so what's all this about you working here? I thought they fired you, and that was why you left!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hypnos... you think all these times I've died, it's because I was upset I was let go from a miserable job?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Wow.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I heard the feast you had here, it was really something else! All the gods, together in one place, eating, drinking, not killing one another! That must have been a sight.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You should have been there, Hypnos! Not that I noticed your absence, though, what happened? Other pressing business?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Slept through the whole thing!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hey, Hypnos? This is for all the well-meaning advice you've given me. A little something from a certain double-bladed-axe-wielding, bull-headed, oversized monster of a man who you admire?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's this, it's kind of hard to read the hand-writing, it says, no way... To Hypnos, my biggest fan. Stay vigilant. Asterius. There's... even a little picture of a bull. You... I... wow... wow!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hoh, says here one of the Wretched Thugs got you, too bad! They're slow but they hit pretty hard I guess. Have you tried moving out of the way?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"According to my list here, why, you must've just got clobbered all the way back home by one of those Wretched Thugs again! The old moving-out-the-way trick didn't work, huh...?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Looks like one of the Wretched Witches shot you dead last time, sorry to hear that, huh? Have you tried shooting them first?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You must have had a run-in with a Spreader, huh! They're much more talented than the low-grade witches down in Tartarus, so your dad lets them stay warm up in Asphodel, I guess!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oof, a Splitter zapped you, didn't she! There's lots of witches in your dad's place, huh? Witchcraft must be pretty dangerous for all those mortals up there. Pretty dangerous for you, too!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Aw, looks like you died from one of those nasty booby traps left by a Wretched Pest, little guys who look like urns? Have you tried avoiding them maybe?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ooh wow, so Megaera herself got you last time, that must have been intense! She's fast, and strong, and beautiful, and... um... anyway, I hope the Fates are nicer to you next time!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hah! Megaera the Fury got you again! She is unstoppable, isn't she? One time, I tried to stop her on the way to have a chat with your dad, and she didn't even turn her head! <Sigh...>",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You got whipped by Megaera the Fury! Eh?! I always wanted to say that. Whipped, you know? Referring both to how badly you lost, and to that glowy purple whip she's always threatening me with whenever I try to talk to her?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So you got skewered by a Spike Trap out there, huh? Well, that's too bad! Have you tried not standing there, like, when the spikes come out?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ooh looks like one of those Dart Traps killed you last time, bet that must have hurt! Have you tried getting behind something?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ow looks like you got blasted to bits by an explosive urn last time! We keep some really nasty shades all bottled up in those, but... you so much as touch them, BOOM! Hah!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male

"Whoaaa, you just got killed by one of those Bloodless Inferno Bomber skeleton type guys, nice! I always wondered what would happen if you just kind of stood around while all their bombs went off!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Owie, looks like the Bone Hydra of Asphodel just stomped you that time, huh? I hear each of its heads has its own nasty tricks. That must be tough!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bone Hydra got you again, huh? Real sorry about that. Though, you know what? I want you to get back out there, you know, all through Tartarus, and Asphodel, again, and knock some sense into it for me, OK? OK!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wait let me guess, don't tell me... you got slaughtered by the Bone Hydra, again! How many times was that? But you will get 'em next time, I just know it! Maybe the time after that. Eventually, no doubt about it!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Daw, one of those Wretched Louts just killed you dead that time, those mean old slappy guys? Maybe try killing them beforehand, I don't know!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ooh, says here a Wretched Lout slapped you to death again, that's a tough break! Have you tried talking it out, or something, I... I don't know?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey you got turned to ashes by those floating Brimstone crystally type things! Next time one's turning you to charcoal with those beams of theirs, how about you step on over to the side?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ooh, ow, so you got burned down to a crisp out there, standing in magma, right? I know you've got your burning feet and all, but standing in magma, why, I'm not so sure that's a good idea!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh, so you walked straight into a burning magma spout, is that what got you this time? Bet if you waited long enough it'd cool off, instead of killing you!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hooh, looks like one of those little Numbskulls took a big old bite right out of you back there, I guess they got you, huh? Maybe if you weren't quite so tasty, they'd leave you alone! And so would I!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Did you just get chomped by one of those little Numbskulls, again?! Oh, that is definitely rough. I guess you must have done something to make the Fates real mad!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hohoh, you got blown up by a Slam-Dancer, I can see it on your face! It also says it on my list! Got everybody's cause of death, right here. Some real morbid stuff from time to time! So anyway, take care!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why you look like someone who just got beaten silly by a dirty skeleton! Beaten well beyond the brink of death, I ought to say! And, sure enough, according to my list, you did! Those Bloodless sure are tough!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My list here says that you got petrified to death that time by some sort of nasty floating gorgon head? No offense to Dusa! Sounds like a pretty painful way to go, though hey! At least you got to be a statue for a little while! I like statues.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Pff, can I just say ouch? Because according to the list here, you got flattened like a pancake by a Skull-Crusher, out in Asphodel somewhere! Keep that up and you're going to get even shorter, haha!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Mmm, you look like someone who just got turned to stone then crushed to a bloody pulp by the Megagorgon of Asphodel, am I right? Well, look, I'm sorry to hear that, and before you ask, I won't tell Dusa, don't you worry about that!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I recognize that look! That is the look of someone who just got here after having met a most unfortunate demise, courtesy of the notorious Bloodless Wave-Makers!! How do they make those waves, and why do they hurt so, so much? Plenty of time to think it over, now!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Looks like you really took the heat from one of those Bloodless Burn-Flingers back there, didn't you? I know how tempting it can be to try and catch those fiery explosive bombs they throw, but... if I might offer you a bit of personal advice? You really shouldn't do that.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, wow, Alecto's got it out for you...? Normally she doesn't kill anyone, she likes keeping them alive... for quite a while, really. Hurts them still, but doesn't kill them off! I guess she really doesn't like you, huh!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you got killed by Tisiphone the Fury, why, then it must mean you've been accused of murder! A most heinous crime, as I'm to understand! Well, I hope you clear your name. Or whatever those mortals do about that stuff!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So, you lost a duel to the death with an Exalted Brightsword, did you? They're pretty much the best of the best, so don't feel bad! It had to happen! But if it's any consolation, it'll probably happen again!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Says here that you got stuck like a piece of meat on a spit by an Exalted Longspear, wow, I'll bet that really hurt! Too bad you don't have a thick, leathery hide or something that could help protect you in that type of situation. Oh well!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Looks like you just got pounded down by an Exalted Greatshield, huh? Did you try attacking while their guard was down? Or, did they just not let down their guard at any point... Oh...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Let me guess, you got caught out by one of those Exalted Strongbows, did you there? Next time, if you don't stand around like you're doing here right now, maybe you won't make such an easy target!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My understanding is you had a little run-in with a Nemean Chariot, just kind of plowed right into you, there, didn't it? You got to watch where you're going crossing the streets of Elysium next time!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Those Archer Statues in Elysium have got to be a real sight, no doubt about it. But, you can't just stand there and admire them, or else they'll shoot you dead like they did just now!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Sounds to me like you got stuck in more ways than one gawking at a Phalanx Statue in Elysium back there! I got to hand it to your dad. He made sure those look just as good as they stab any intruders like yourself!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Says here that you got flash-fried to a crisp within a Phoenix Urn's destructive blast back there, I mean, you really ought to stay away from those, if you ask me!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Woow, I can't believe you took on the Minotaur, no way! No wonder you're back here! Everyone knows that he's unstoppable. Especially me! Hey, next you run into him, could you... get his autograph, for me?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Minotaur killed you again, that must have been exciting, huh? So, any chance you got that autograph for me, before you got destroyed?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Slain by the Minotaur once more, now he's a real beast, there, isn't he! But, tell me something, any progress on that autograph request of mine?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I just knew that you'd be back, soon as I heard you faced the Champion of Elysium, himself! You know, I've heard that, among mortals, it's an honor to be killed by somebody like Theseus! Keep it up, and maybe you'll be famous, too!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, I have to say, I just don't think you have a real chance against both Theseus and the Minotaur, together! But, you might just have a chance to get the Minotaur's autograph for me, if maybe you ask nice or something?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Good, you're back! So, prior to when Theseus killed you again back there, did you, by any chance, happen to ask his big bull buddy for an autograph for me, this time?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Looks like somebody just found out that some types of butterflies are incredibly dangerous! Especially the ones that come swarming out of those Soul Catchers! If only you could just... not have a soul, or something? Then they'd bother somebody else!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So, one of those Flame Wheels drove right into you, and burst into a fiery explosion, killing both of you, is that what happened there? Well if it makes you feel any better, technically, I think this means you got your revenge!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You had a run-in with those nasty Satyrs all the way up in the Temple of Styx, huh. I can't even imagine the sheer agony, having their lethal poison coursing through my body!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, I've only heard the tales of the gigantic, vicious, flesh-eating vermin up there near the surface. Now I guess we both know that those tales are definitely true!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Eugh, it says here you got chewed up by an angry swarm of Crawlers somewhere just a stone's throw from the exit to your dad's domain? Talk about adding insult to injury, huh?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Oh, I heard the pests of Tartarus had bigger, meaner counterparts up near the surface, but... I guess you just found out the hard way, huh? When you tripped one of their explosive things?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"I know that look, why, that's the look of someone just incinerated by a Snakestone, am I right? They spit a whole bunch of those white-hot, flesh-burning beams right at the same time, there, don't they?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Don't want to talk about it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, you're back! Wait, wait, what happened? My list says you got killed by a Redacted, what's that even mean? I've never seen anything like this!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Why don't you ask Father when he's back.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Redacteds got you again, huh. Here's the thing, I keep asking around about them and no one seems to know what I'm talking about! Could you maybe describe them for me, please?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I guess so!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Huh, that's funny. Nothing on my list at all this time, except... I could have sworn I saw you walk right out of the Pool back there. I'll have to have this thing looked at.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Cheers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The list is telling me you caught one of those gigantic Temple saw blades square in the chest, huh? Eugh... At least you're back in one piece!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yeah.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's the matter, there, you got a splitting headache from those giant falling axes in the Temple of Styx? Well I have just the cure, which is: Don't get hit by them!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Sure!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well somebody just walked into a cloud of noxious gas, there, huh! Must have lost all your vital functions pretty quickly after that! Next time, you'll know it's seriously deadly stuff, because it killed you! And because it's green!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hahahaha.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, you just plain ran out of time and died, all according to the Pact of Punishment, there, huh? Now that is what I call a deadline, hahahaha!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, says here you just blew yourself right up that time, with that weird infernal shooty thing you stole? Remember, next time, shoot the other guys!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, keep them.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, wait wait wait, this just can't be right, it says, it says... hahahahah, you got beaten by a tiny little rodent? Oh, haha, sorry I just, I, you have my sympathies.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I just wanted to see you again, Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Wait, what, you're back already? Hey, my list says that you barely made it out of here before you died! Were you even trying? Because if you were, why, maybe you need to try a whole lot harder than that next time!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Oh, you got throttled by a Wringer, must have grabbed and crushed you like a grape! You know what grapes are, right? They're like big, squishy pomegranate seeds.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, looks like you ran smack into the Doomstone out in Tartarus, thing gives me the creeps! Next time, try standing perfectly still. That way, it'll all be over that much faster!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, you're the latest victim of a Wretched Sneak, that's something, right? They like to get you when you least expect it, so next time, why not keep spinning around and around? Then you'll catch them trying to sneak up!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So, let me guess, one minute you were minding your own business out in Asphodel, and then the next, one of those Dracons pops up right in front of you and pfeh! Just kills you dead with noxious acid breath. Ah, well! It happens, right?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Going toe-to-toe with one of those Bloodless Bone-Rakers didn't go so well, huh? Next time they're ripping you to shreds, remember: That's your signal to be someplace else, instead!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wow, you just barged into the Witches Circle out in Asphodel, and they just filled you full of all those stinging purple orbs and killed you, huh? You can't just show up expecting to join their club! You have to study witchcraft for years!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, my brother Charon killed you, am I seeing this right? He's never been particularly nice to me! Whacked me with his oar a couple times, but it never got that bad. Must be some misunderstanding, have you talked to him?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You had it out with Charon again, huh? And turned out like it did before! The thing you have to understand is he's got lots of upper body strength. You seen the definition in his arms? Maybe try some rowing for yourself!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So you met a violent end aboard the infamous Barge of Death sailing the river of flame! Surrounded by skeletons bleeding you dry, Voidstones making all of them invincible...! Have you thought about taking a different barge?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Probably!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, what happened to you, you just... died? You just plain died, like... nothing stabbed you, bludgeoned you, poisoned you, burned you, crushed you, blew you to bits, turned you to stone, but... you're back here! Must have been those Natural Causes mortals talk about!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahaha, no.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Natural Causes got you again, huh? That's a real shame, I mean, imagine one day you're just going about your business, and then ack!! You're dead! Although I guess you don't have to imagine it like I do!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Sure!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Darned Natural Causes got you once again, there, didn't they? Well, you show them next time! Would you do that for me, huh?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You've done it now, Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...You're late with your report, Hypnos. Again. Again! The dead of course can wait, but I'm less patient. Now, explain yourself to me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh! Well, let's see, I woke up, I don't know what time it was, and I made sure that every shade had been accounted for, just like I always do, except I couldn't find my list at first, can you believe it? I thought maybe my brother played a little prank, and so...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Get to the blasted point already, I don't have all day! Or night. Urgh! Your report, where is it?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sure I was just getting to it, Master! My list, I found it over by the lounge, it was inside, but I am not the one who put it there, no sir! So I've been making positively sure it's not been tampered with, that it has everybody's name, cause of death, place of birth, former body weight, any previous allergies or medications...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Enough!! Blood and darkness, that's enough from you, just... see to it the ledger of the dead is accurate, and get back to your post. Ugh, would that you could be more like your brother.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
OK!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"...Your reports have been much more punctual of late, Hypnos. That is to be expected. However... the illustrated edges... a clever detail. Ensures certain reports are easily procured from a stack of parchment.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, thanks, Master, glad you like those! Ever since Thanatos made pretty clear to me I was about to lose my job, I started keeping a list of my own tasks, which I sort through each day, deciding on priority, estimating time to completion, cost-benefit analysis...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, well. Certainly, then, you have a number of such tasks requiring your attention. Continue working diligently, then.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
No.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Master, I just can't thank you enough for putting my picture on the board there in the lounge! I heard it's a good picture! I haven't had time to see it yet, but I am going to, it's on the list!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hypnos... that shall be all. Lest I rescind your commendation and cast you out of here.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"....Um, could you say all that again with smaller words, Master, because I thought it maybe sounded kind of bad?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Yes, Mom. I mean...Mother!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"...I just get sleepy, sometimes, Mom, I mean, I've been working so much, lately, just over there? You've probably seen me, greeting shades, making my list, creating a welcoming environment...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Remember what we previously spoke of, Hypnos. Do not address me thus whilst we are here. Conduct yourself as befitting a servant of the House of Hades... and, continue practicing your independence, please.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female

Great! I will!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Good work, Hypnos!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You have demonstrated sustained competence in your duties, Hypnos. It gladdens me to see measurable progress. Your efforts are to be commended.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Aw, wow, thanks! Commended by whom, exactly? Megaera? Thanatos? Dusa, maybe! Not the Master himself?!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Commended by me. I cannot always look after all of my children, as you know. It falls upon them to take care of themselves, as well as their obligations to our domain. As your mother... it is reassuring to see that you are capable.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Capable? Me? Aw, Mom... I mean, um, Mother Nyx! Nobody's ever called me that before!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are my son. It is to be expected. However... I know it is not effortless, to be of use. Continue to do well. I shall be watching.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I truly appreciate it.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female

I like having a best friend!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male

Oh you bet!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hypnos, wanted to say you have really helped the thought of my coming back here time after time, painful death by death, not be inherently abhorrent. Your greetings really help! So I wanted you to have this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But, but, but, wait, this, it's Ambrosia! You are not supposed to have this here! We could both get in a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, if they catch us in the middle of this totally forbidden exchange!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male

I'll have to give that a shot.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Always happy to oblige. Especially when it causes me to risk my station. To risk everything I've worked for.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What are you doing back here, Zagreus? I risked everything by helping you out there. So that was all for nothing, then?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Far from it, Than. I got where I needed to go, and if not for your help, maybe I wouldn't have. As for why I'm back... as Father would say, I have some business to attend to, here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well! Don't let me stop you, then. Always happy to risk my station for your sake. To risk everything I've worked for.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Be on your way, Zagreus. I have an audience with Lord Hades in a moment. An inquiry into my recent absences.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What are you worried about, Than? You've never given him a reason not to trust you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Recently, I'm not so sure. Whatever you're doing, it had better be worth it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Don't be ridiculous, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I still cannot entirely believe you really think there's any way you're getting out of here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Why? You've been out. It's thanks to you the mortals end up down here maybe half the time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's different, that's my job. I can't stay there, and frankly I can barely stand it. Do you have any idea how bright it gets, up there?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
No. But I look forward to finding out for myself.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch, well. We'll see what the Fates have to say about that. Maybe the shade of Daedalus can make you some protective eyewear or something.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Couldn't if I tried!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanatos, the world outside... didn't you say that it would make you sick, being out there for very long at all? I understand now what you meant by that. Beautiful place and all, but... it's good to be back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"See what I mean, now, Zag? Nice place to visit on occasion, sure. But I definitely wouldn't want to live there.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I met her, you know. Persephone, I mean. You look more like your father, but... you have her eyes. One of them, anyway.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You never spoke of her to me. You must have known... you kept the truth from me, the same as Nyx?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's not like that. I didn't know any more than you. Besides, Lord Hades ordered all of us to never speak of her again. I thought it just a bad relationship. I didn't realize she left her son.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusTalkDenialReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Something tells me Father wouldn't let her take me even if she wanted.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Maybe so. But even still, she did abandon you. Your family's here, if you ask me. But I can understand that... you need answers.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Hm.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I met her, you know. Persephone, I mean. You look more like your father, but, you have her eyes. One of them, anyway.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You never spoke of her to me. You must have known... you kept the truth from me, the same as Nyx?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's not like that. I didn't know any more than you. Besides, Lord Hades ordered all of us to never speak of her again. I thought it just a bad relationship. I didn't realize she left her son.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusTalkDenialReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Something tells me Father wouldn't let her take me even if she wanted.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Than. Come join me in the lounge for old time's sake. The coast is clear. The work can wait.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're really asking me to join you for a drink...? I mean... you know what, sure. The work can wait.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...I somehow knew, you know. I always knew you weren't going to stay. You were... so restless here. You just needed a reason to leave! And I hoped you wouldn't find one this quickly. Eugh. What am I saying? You have no idea.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"No, I know exactly what you're saying, Than. I'm sorry that I'm putting you through all of this, it's just... it's something that I have to do. But, I'm glad we know the truth about me, now. Maybe we can move on from there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsk... I've always lacked your optimism, Zag. Anyway... the work has waited long enough, I need to get back to it. Thanks for the drink.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Watch yourself out there, Zagreus. I have to go.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Yeah, seriously.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanatos, I've meant to ask... is it really the case that many mortals have a crippling fear of death?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is, I'm quite feared, up there. Most of them cannot distinguish between me, and, say, Lord Ares, or your father, even. We fill them with despair. No helping it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Why not? I mean, isn't it kind of a big problem that they have such negative associations, here? Can't we... I don't know, do something to educate them all?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We've all the time to educate them, here. Their ignorance of death is solved almost as soon as they experience their first. Though I suppose they might be better off knowing before the fact.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Didn't know you saw it that way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than? I had another question about death. So... why is it mortals grieve so much about the thing, I mean... it definitely hurts there for a little while, but... it's not that bad.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They see it as their one and only chance. Imagine if, after you perished, that was it. Back to the infinite Chaos. Everything about you. Returned to how it was before you were even there.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"But that's absurd. One life? Though... eugh. That's horrible, even to think about.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know, right? Some of them know that isn't how it is, and try to tell their kind about what it is we do here, but... it's slow going, getting the information out. Either way! I get to be the bearer of good news.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It really is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Than? Something's been troubling me still, with what you said, about how mortals look at death. If most of them believe their life is all they have... how do they live? I mean, I can't even imagine what that's like. I'd be a lot more careful, at the very least!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They live with all their hearts, or at least try. I think there's something to it, truthfully. Though, some of them, they fall apart. They get here without me. On their own, gripped with despair. If only they knew what your father always says about all this.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What, you mean that 'there is no escape'? From what? The mortals are up there, not here. Not while they're technically alive in their sense, anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I mean, you can't escape your problems, Zagreus. You can run from your family, but you can't run from everything. You have no choice but to confront it, and work through it, sooner or later, one way or another. You, and all of us.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...I'm starting to notice that, yes. Though, to a mortal who has yet to die... don't they think of death as some sort of release? You come to end their misery, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can release them from their decaying bodies. Sometimes, the Fates demand I bring them in sooner. That's about as much as I can do. Some of them get it early on, how to live. It's quite impressive, really, that they learn so quick.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I can see that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, just how far are you able to shift, anyway, Than? I never could go more than a blade's length in front of me, while you're out there skipping across the entire world probably.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Most of it, yes. Don't beat yourself up, though, Zagreus. It's a practiced skill but I've apparently been able to do it since birth. Mother Nyx says I was a real handful.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Go get them.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, what is it you're always staring at out there, anyway, Than? I don't see anything.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The River Styx is right in front of you, and you don't see anything, Zag? I can watch it endlessly. Studying the competition, you might say. Most mortals expect to get here by river, with Charon. Not with me.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"So you're locked in ruthless battle with a river, searching it for any signs of weakness, that sort of thing? That sounds stressful.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I find it rather soothing as a matter of fact. A break from having to deal constantly with mortal souls. Speaking of which... I have to pick somebody up right now.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sure she's lovely, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than, my blade, the one I'm borrowing from Father anyway, it... revealed to me an older aspect of itself, of Nemesis. Nyx never mentions her. Have you two ever met?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"In case you haven't noticed, most of us who sprang from Nyx, we're not exactly close. Nemesis is fully occupied meting out justice on the surface. Our paths are not designed to cross. And based on everything I know, that's fine with me.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"All right, then!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How's that Rail of Adamant been working out for you lately? Always figured the direct approach was more your style. Though, I happened to have a look at your permanent record lately, and turns out you're doing a lot of work with that thing.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Why, Thanatos, you're learning to pry in others' business! The Rail's been working out just fine, thanks. Though, now that you mention it, how well do you know Eris, one of Nyx's daughters, right? Seems she wielded the Rail before me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The mortals call her Strife. She and her children... it's thanks partly to their dedicated efforts I'm so busy all the time. Though, it is best we didn't speak of her, I think.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Huh. Maybe. I hope.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"That sounds awful. If it's that bad, why would all the Olympians chat it up so much?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"There's no accounting for their taste, I guess. But, I'm discounting certain aspects that are not so bad. You know what? I'll not spoil the surprise. I have a feeling you're going to see for yourself soon enough.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thanatos, I ought have asked by now, but... what's it like? Up there I mean, outside. You never talk about it, I... almost forget that's where you go, for work.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What can I say? It's... different. I never stay up there for very long, don't think I could, starts making me feel ill. Too many sensations all at once. And when the chariot of Helios is in the sky, it gets so bright that I can barely see.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"That sounds awful. If it's that bad, why would all the Olympians chat it up so much?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"There's no accounting for their taste, I guess.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What's going on with Charon, by the way, if you can tell me, Than? He's... never been particularly talkative, but he really seems to know the inner workings of this place.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I correspond with Charon all the time, but even I don't know the full extent of his responsibilities. He's an independent contractor of sorts, been here forever. Your father gives him plenty of space to work.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
He must be compensated pretty well for having done this for so long. Tending the influx of new souls and all of that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I doubt he's in it for the compensation, Zagreus. There is no Underworld without Charon. I think he knows that, and your father knows it, too.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, were you ever close with Charon, Than? Seems like no matter how much I try, I can't quite get through to him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wouldn't be surprised if you were closer to him than I am. Not all of Nyx's sons and daughters keep in steady touch. Though at least we're not always at each others' throats, like the other side of your family.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Did he really think that far ahead...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than, you're not going to believe this, but... Charon's been helping me. All on his own, apparently! I was so sure that Nyx or someone put him up to it. That Skelly character I mentioned, Charon hired him!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What are you talking about, Zagreus? Just because Charon's selling you things doesn't mean he's helping you. Wait, are you sure?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I'm sure! His helper, Skelly, he's a lot more talkative, and finally let on. Although, he couldn't tell me how come Charon did a thing like this, I mean... we weren't ever close...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hmm. All I can think of is... Charon's very dedicated to this House. Like some of us. Maybe he thought... he could help settle things, between you and your father. One way or another.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Don't think you will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Than, now hypothetically, if I were to have vanquished Charon in single combat after having, I don't know, say, helped myself to one of his wares at no charge, how long would you say he'd hold it over me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Everything is an exchange with Charon, Zag. If there was something you refused to pay for, then I'm going to assume that's why you're back here, now. The debt is paid in obols, or in blood. Or their closest counterparts, I guess.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Than, level with me on this. You didn't happen to hire a shifty character called Skelly to assist me here and there, did you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Who, what? No. Why would you even ask?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Radiance, huh... doesn't sound like Father at all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Do you remember anything else about my mother, Than? Just, anything. You weren't close, I guess?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We weren't. She kept to herself as I recall, and I would do the same. Unlike my present company, I do not ask too many questions. It was quite clear to me she wasn't from this place.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Father isn't from this place, either. How was she any different?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sometimes I have to be reminded that Lord Hades wasn't born here, like the rest of us. But Persephone, she... she had a radiance about her, I suppose. Reminded me of the outside, but... I don't mean that in a negative respect.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Than, you don't hold a grudge against old Sisyphus, do you? He seems rather apprehensive about you. I understand you met not on the best of terms.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He is a brazen one, I have to give him that. I hadn't realized that you were close. Despite some questionable choices on your part, I don't think you're the poorest judge of character, and so... maybe I have him wrong.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I only have a faint impression of the man he used to be, although it seems he's changed a lot, since then. Thank you for understanding, anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Don't think you will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I heard you stayed the knave-king's sentence. I should be angry with you. Sisyphus must be the only mortal ever to have humiliated me. But Mother Nyx, she... must have backed you, didn't she...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We did what needed to be done. As much as Father likes making examples out of wretched shades, an eternal sentence felt a little excessive in this case. Besides... Sisyphus isn't leaving, anyway. Seems to have found his niche.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh? Well, he's an odd one through and through, I guess. As long as I don't have to deal with him again.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You and Achilles ever get to talk much, Than?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I have my orders, he has his. What do you think? Even back when he was still alive, there was no real chance I was going to be the one to take him here, given his line of work.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Because he was a warrior. When mortals die a violent death, they're no longer your case, are they?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No. I tend to those in less of a hurry to come here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It is. I think it is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Your trainer's been absent from his post, more so than usual. You voided his pact with Lord Hades, didn't you? I don't know how you did it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You know he's more than my trainer, Than. As for how I did it, turns out being the first and only son of Hades has its privileges. Now Achilles gets to be with someone he loves. Who loves him back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Love is common among mortals. Is theirs really so special as to be worth the trouble? Not just on your part, but theirs?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
...Oh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You've seen a lot of Megaera lately, haven't you, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It's not like that, Than. She's there to slow me down. Get in my way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
If you insist. Although I think it's much more complicated than you say.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yeah... her sisters are back. They're... hard to deal with. I don't think Meg is on good terms with either one.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That's not what I meant. But fine, you've told me all I need to know, for now.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I know what you mean.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You and Meg go back a long way, don't you? I forget sometimes you two are pretty close.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Our responsibilities must have us cross paths often, yes. But I didn't really get to know her until after the whole humiliating affair with Sisyphus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh, right. He got stuck in Tartarus after that, under Meg's personal supervision. So you bonded over your shared disdain for Sisyphus?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We each had to blow off some steam, yes. That was some of the hardest I ever worked, back then, and her, too, I think. When you go through something like that with someone, it brings you closer, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
...Sure. Sounds good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than, there's something that I meant to tell you. Ask you, rather. You're close with Megaera, so, what I mean is... you know about us, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, of course. Why do you ask?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Well, it's just... I figured since you deal with mortals all the time, I know that some of them, they choose a single suitor. It's a valid custom, if it's yours...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The mortals have their customs, yes, indeed. Quite a variety, in point of fact. However, none as yet have stuck with me, I think. So don't concern yourself with things like that.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're saying you're not angry with me? Or Meg, for that matter?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Not any more than usual. Tell her that I said hello when next you meet.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Yeah, well... thanks, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than, you don't take issue with me being close with Dusa, do you? She brings such warmth to this place... I really appreciate having her here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You don't need to ask me such things, Zagreus. They're your feelings.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Than, what's your relationship with Ares on Olympus? I know he deals in death himself, but... his approach seems rather different from your own.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I do not care for his approach at all. But he has been professionally courteous with me. More than I can say for most of your Olympian relatives, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You mean the rest of the Olympians don't treat you well?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Discounting Hermes, I should say, the rest of them have nothing much to do with me at all. I can imagine why, I know it's complicated with your father here. But as for Ares... I think he's all right.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Eh, you're probably right...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than? I thought you ought to know that Ares, he... I think he's taken quite an interest in Nyx. Keeps asking me to talk to her on his behalf.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Finally. It's about time Olympus took notice of Mother and all her accomplishments.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Finally? You don't think Ares has untoward intentions or anything like that?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He'd be a hollow fool if he did. Why do you think they fear us on Olympus, Zagreus? Because of Hypnos? I don't think Mother Nyx requires your concern. Though, by all means, talk to her about it, if you like.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Least I could do for all she's done for me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Mother Nyx told me you restored the Eldest Sigil, Zagreus. I couldn't believe that was your doing. What you did... it meant a lot to her.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It was my pleasure. Say, did Nyx ever let on to you of her relationship with Chaos, at any point?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, not everyone is quite as sharing as you are, Zag. Nor as inclined to pry. But still... in this case, sounds like it worked out. So, thank you. If she hasn't said as much.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Tsch.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I can tell when Mother Nyx is upset, Zagreus. And I know better than to ask her, so I'm going to ask you. What happened?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Probably because Nyx took issue with me chatting with Dusa from time to time. Is that really so unbecoming of me? Not even Father seems to care.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Mother cares! And I, for one, know better than to question it. None of us would be here were it not for her. If she has a request for you, you honor it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You're telling me I should just start ignoring Dusa from now on, like you do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're a god. I'm telling you to learn to act like one.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thanks...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm sorry I raised my voice with you last time, Than. I know Nyx puts so much into this place, and has nurtured so many of us here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's not me you should be apologizing to, Zag. Although, with Mother Nyx, sometimes it's best to leave her be. As for Dusa... I didn't mean to suggest you should abandon your friend.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Maybe you should.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx let her go, Than. Dusa, I mean, she's gone. What do I do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If I were you, I would start getting over it as soon as possible. But, I don't see you doing that. Just remember... maybe this isn't about you. Dusa's job may have been far too much for her. Mother Nyx is strict, but she is fair.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Then she should give Dusa another chance. Has Meg heard? She'll be furious.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Megaera will be no such thing. Some of us don't default to questioning every decision from our superiors.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I don't think we have to worry about that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I saw that Dusa's back. You must have worked your ways on Mother Nyx. Don't know how you do it. Can't remember the last time I saw her budge on anything.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Nyx genuinely cares about this House and all of us. She had to come around on something like this. Dusa's one of the hardest workers here. Even if she has room to improve.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Incessant hard work can lead to trouble, Zagreus. I think maybe that's why Mother was concerned. We all know how your father can get. She doesn't need someone like Dusa taking after him.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
He's like an annoying little brother to me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Than, you know, Hypnos, he adores you. Besides just driving you to madness, now and then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm rather used to the relationship, thanks, Zagreus. Seems like you got to know him pretty well.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, dying repeatedly can end up bringing people closer, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know what's worse, dying repeatedly or Hypnos. Although, I guess I'm grateful for your patience with him, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Probably!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Got to tell you something, Than. You can be pretty mean to Hypnos! And that's coming from someone who's mean to Hypnos a lot. Believe me, I completely understand, but... still.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's utterly incompetent, Zag. He wouldn't even be here if Mother Nyx wasn't trying to whip him into some sort of shape.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah, but... pretty much none of this would be here, were it not for Nyx, right? Anyway my point is not that you should go easy on him, but... there must be some way not to get as frustrated. You'll both be better off.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I know, it's just...! You're right. I catch myself feeling particularly horrid after talking to him. He can be very frustrating, and self-absorbed... though, I know he means well. Probably.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Who doesn't have room for improvement, though, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I can hardly believe it. Hypnos finally came out on top, huh? Even Father seemed pleased with him. That's more than I get.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can hardly believe it either, Zagreus. But then again, he's one of Mother Nyx's offspring, so we shouldn't be so surprised. Though, I have to thank you for talking to me about him a while back...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh, that? I noticed you two getting along better recently. So what's your secret?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He loves lists. Doesn't do well with subtlety, so much, but spell things out for him, and he will get right on it. Long as he's awake, at least. He's still working on that part.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Than, wait...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I saw you voided the old pact between Orpheus and your father. So now he gets to see his wife from time to time?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"He does, and I did, Than. I think we can stand to see a little less of him if it means he can be happier for the remainder of eternity.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You really need to learn to stop meddling in others' affairs. Did either of them even ask your help? I can't imagine Orpheus did, and I'm guessing his wife's feelings were complicated, too, from what I know of the circumstances of their final meeting.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What? Orpheus is my mate, Than. And I came to know his muse, Eurydice, as well. They still had feelings for each other, but with no way to communicate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So you decided to step in. Tsch. I think my instincts on the subject are just not the same as yours. I know your intentions were in the right place, but... you know what, forget it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I can hazard a guess...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I saw the Fated List of Minor Prophecies was requisitioned through the House Contractor, Zagreus. Didn't take you for an agent of the Fates.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Turns out I'm full of surprises, Thanatos. Though, the Three Fates are your sisters, aren't they? Surprised you didn't requisition the List yourself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Guess it just wasn't meant to be. Though, I don't know them at all. Keep only to themselves, somewhere. Sometimes I wonder whether everything really is preordained, or whether they're making all this up as they go.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You took Lord Hades down... you really did. I've never seen him quite like this before. I could scarce believe it when he came up through the Pool of Styx, himself...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Seemed only fair in the grand scheme of things. He slew his own parents at some point, right? I think the Fates enjoy this sort of thing.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come on, Zag, take some credit where it's due. Though... you'll forgive me if I keep my distance for a little while, as I think you have some issues to resolve. You watch yourself.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I'll hold you to that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...You're really staying, Zagreus? I mean... between the generally ill-conceived attempts to reach the surface every so often.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I am. I figured it's the only way I could continue interrupting you while you try to do your job. You work too hard, Than, live a little, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heh. Well then, I'll see what I can do about that. You'll have to show me what you mean by 'live a little', though.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Yeah.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Have to tell you something, Than. My birthmother... she didn't abandon me. Or at least... she didn't think she did.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She didn't think she did? What are you talking about, Zag? She left when you were born. Was never seen or spoken of again, until all this with you.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Well, it turns out... she never knew I was alive, at all. Complications when I was born. She had been struggling already here, and it was all too much, I guess. By the time Nyx brought me back... my mother was long gone.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What? But, Mother Nyx, and your father, they... could have sent for her, let her know... they must have known where she went!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Nyx knew. But, Father must have convinced her that my mother... that it would be for the best if she never found out. About me. So she could live in peace. Away from all of this. And away from Olympus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That's... a lot to take in.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Answer me something, Zagreus. What am I to you, exactly, as of late? Because, sometimes, with you, I...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I'm sometimes at a loss myself, Thanatos. Though one thing I know is it's always really good running into you out there, it's... well, exciting. Sparring with you and all that! And then, I know it means that I might get to see you here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, here I am. But you didn't answer my question. Though, you know something? Forget I asked. I've got to go.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Hey, Than, tell me something, and forgive the awkward question here, but... are we good? I mean... between us. Any infuriating habits I should know about, that sort of thing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know I don't have time to list all your infuriating habits, Zagreus. Though... if any of them were outside my usual tolerance threshold, I promise to let you know, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So then, we're good. Because I think we're good, but I just wanted to make sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We're good. See you, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Definitely.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...It just struck me how much you've changed, Zag. I still remember when you kept trying to singe Cerberus' tail with your feet. Haven't seen you do that in a while.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh, I definitely learned my lesson there. But, thanks, I guess. You've opened up a lot, yourself, by the way. Talking to you lately, it's a world apart from the first time. You looked like you were going to slice my head off.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It sure must have taken a lot of courage for you to come right up and tell me you thought I looked better before I cut my hair. I still ask myself how come I didn't keep ignoring you after that. Or slice your head off.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, the option is always available, I guess. Hey, you ever think of growing it out again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No. It kept getting in my way. Sliced it right off and never looked back. So... plenty of personal growth all around, then?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I hope so.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How's everything been going with your mother, Zagreus? You've been pretty quiet about the whole thing, is everything all right? You can tell me.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thank you for asking, Than. I don't know how much more I can say right now, given everything. I'm still figuring it out myself. I'm thankful you've been there to help me get to see her from time to time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, if there's something more that I can do to support you in this, let me know, all right? Sounds like you're making progress, at least.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Bye, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, between us... all your attempting to break out of here, over and over... you're now authorized to keep that up? Exposing weaknesses in Underworld security, huh.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Something like that. I guess I've gotten pretty decent about escaping from a place that's known for being inescapable. Lets me keep in touch with the other side of the family. Work with you from time to time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have to say I never thought I'd hear you talking about looking forward to working, Zag. You feeling all right? Spending too much time on the surface, maybe?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I'm feeling fine. I never thought I was much good at anything, but... if my fated purpose is to be a master of frustrating Father's efforts to make everything strictly perfect, I think I'm OK with that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, then, I'll be looking forward to working with you in a more official capacity. Even if we're still supposed to keep it all under wraps, for sake of appearances. See you out there.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Oh I entirely agree with that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Have to tell you, Zag. It's different, with your mother around here. Don't mean to be so obvious, but... it's something about your father, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I think they have a lot of work ahead of them. As long as they're trying... he's trying... I think I'm good with that, for now. Though, I am glad she's here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm beginning to think we all are. And, please don't take this the wrong way, but... I think you and your father have a lot of work ahead of you, as well.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Bye, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Your mother's very clever, Zagreus. I always thought you got that from your father, now I'm not so sure. So all is well with the Olympians, again?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"For now, I think it is. But, you know how they are. How we all are, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah! Yes, indeed. Well, then! I guess enjoy it while it lasts, as mortals sometimes say. I'll see you out there.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
<Sigh>,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Such tardiness is oft to be expected from your brother, but from you, Thanatos? You're practically the god of punctuality.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"My lord, I apologize sincerely for the lapse in my performance as of late. I think my duties following the recent war above took more of a toll from me than I expected.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thanatos, even we gods require rest from time to time. Someday we might get it around here, once this accursed House is well in order, finally. Until then, I appreciate your diligence. Do not overextend yourself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Thank you, my lord. I am at your service. I'll be getting back to my assignment now.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...You have been rather slow about your duties, lately, Thanatos. And I'm receiving incident reports from Tartarus involving you. Remember your responsibilities. And, remember, I am watching you. Now, get out of my sight.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You've been abetting him, Thanatos. Behind my back! Betrayal. I would ask you why. Well?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My lord, he and I... please. Go lock me up in Tartarus, or deal whichever justice you see fit, but... my loyalty is not subject to change. And I cannot stand by and watch you fight. The matter between you and Zagreus... there has to be some resolution, here.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You dare to lecture me? Tsch. My loyal subjects are too few of late, I think. This is your realm, not mine; I'll not cast you into that wretched pit. It's not like I have someone to replace you here, besides. Now then, begone.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I'm deeply sorry, lord...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You wished to see me once again, my lord? It's been... a while since I had an audience with you.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It has. The last time, what was it you said? That there must be some resolution to the matter, as you called it, with my son? Well it is settled, now. Isn't it, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I mean, you're still trying just as hard as ever to prevent me from escaping past the threshold of your realm, so, I don't know if I'd exactly call the matter settled. But... it does feel different, now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And so you see... I would continue in our mutual good graces, if you please. This House can only function if the upper management is in accord. What do you say?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I say, you honor me, my lord. I appreciate you telling me, yourself. And I concur that, for the good of all the Underworld, it is imperative that each of us continue to perform at our full strength.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, as you were. Dismissed.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Oh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hypnos, really, that is the worst idea I think I've ever heard. Do you understand how little sense that makes?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm just saying, maybe if you just, I don't know, had all the mortals die at the same time, it'd save you a bunch of trips, and then we'd have more time to spend together, huh?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know why I bother with you, honestly. Get back to work, and let me do the same.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Oof.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You cannot keep falling asleep on the job like this, Hypnos. This is completely unacceptable.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I just nodded off a little while, Thanatos! I rest easy knowing that you're here! But if I goofed, why, I guess you could kill me dead, or something, huh?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Don't give me any ideas. Pull yourself together, and quit slacking off. The House needs help, and you've got a job to do. Now get to it!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oof, sorry Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Hypnos, this list has a bunch of tasks from I don't know how long ago, I mean... I took several of these last year! And you've already submitted this week's registrations, why isn't that marked complete?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't you know it, I was just about to get to that! Then you showed up, and I got so distracted, it just kind of slipped my mind! It happens, right?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"You need to focus, Brother. Or it'll be Lord Hades reprimanding you again, and that is not something you want.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh, I don't know about that, last time I talked to Master he made pretty clear he never wanted to speak to me again!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't worry, I won't!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hypnos, you're not irreplaceable, you understand? If you don't shape up, quickly, someone else is going to have your job.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh I hear you loud and clear, Thanatos! And, let me tell you, they will have the greatest job in all the Underworld!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I feel like I'm not getting through to you, Brother. Well, after the inevitable happens, don't come telling me I didn't try.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
If that'll be all?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Well, how often do you consult these lists you make? If you're spending too much time just making lists, you're not leaving time to get anything done.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh, I love making my lists... I always illustrate the edges, each one is unique! That way anyone who gets to review the work, it's a whole experience, you know? But... I guess it does take up a lot of time.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You'll have to work around the constraints of your responsibilities. You do take breaks, don't you? Before and after each break, maybe that's a time to make sure your own list of priorities is up-to-date.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wait, my own list of priorities...? But, you're saying I can just go and make a list... for me? Huh. Whoa. Whoa....",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Aww, thanks!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Good work, Hypnos!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I've heard that your reports have been immaculate of late, Hypnos. I have to know, who's helping you with them? It can't be Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Oh, haha, no, he doesn't help. It's just I took to listing only the important stuff up top, and spending just a bit more time on the priority reports, and... guess it's working out!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, whatever the case... the work's improved. It's been observed. You ought to keep it up.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh, that is right!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"...Though, what I mean to say is, that... I'm sorry, Hypnos. You're my brother, but I haven't always treated you that way. Would you be willing to forgive me?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Aww, come on, Thanatos, are you kidding me, right here? We're like two skeletons in a crypt! You're the best, and you're always looking out for me. Even when you're not around for what can seem like aeons at a time!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well let's not get ahead of ourselves, here. We each have got important jobs to do. Isn't that right, Brother?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Will do!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Hey, he did it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Congratulations, Brother! I saw you finally made the board. You made us proud.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Sure did! That's something, huh? Though, sorry Thanatos, can't really chat right now, the shades are stacking up, there's greetings to be done, and sign-ins... lots of work to do, you know?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"I definitely know the feeling. Well then, let's keep it up, the both of us, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Farewell.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Mother, is there something I can do to help, with all of this? I spend too much time away from the House. Please, let me know.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You are already doing what you can to help, my son. Continue doing so. Matters are at stake here concerning you and all of us. Your support and choices in this shape the outcome that shall come to pass.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I understand, and I will do my best. Thank you for taking care of everything. I've every faith in you, Mother. And in this House. Farewell.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thank you, my son.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Heh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Am I imagining it, Mother, or has this House been running relatively smoothly as of late? Although I know I must be tempting the Three Fates by putting it like this.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It is through a concerted effort that the House thus thrives, for now. Though, it shall do so only through continued diligence on your behalf, and that of many others here. It is a good occasion to take brief reprieve. But we need you working to the best of your ability, here, Thanatos.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Well... know that I am ever-grateful, Mother. And I love you very much. Where would we be right now if not for you? I don't take what you've done for us for granted, nor does anybody here. You rest assured.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...But that was then and this is now, and we have work to do.... Uh, anyway, Than, I think we'd best continue this discussion at some other time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're interrupting private conversation, Zagreus. Leave us.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"No, let him stay, if that's what he wants. What does it matter? He's technically allowed within these halls, but he must know he isn't welcome anymore.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I know how mortals hate waiting around!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Queen Persephone. All of us, we are most pleased you're back. If there is anything that I can do to ease your acclimation to this House, you need but ask.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Why, thank you, Thanatos! I'll take you up on that if I can think of anything anytime soon. But my, you've grown! I understand you've been looking after my son, in the meantime?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your son, he... is very capable of looking after himself, it turns out. Although I try to be there, just in case. Though, I must beg your pardon, Queen. Someone awaits me on the surface now.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
All right!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"...I thank you for your blessings, Queen Persephone. Your son and I... we always were quite close, but through all this ordeal, we've become rather inseparable, I think.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Well, I can see that he has better taste than I do, Thanatos! I have a sense of how industrious you are. You just take care of yourself, please. And take care of each other, too, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"As you will, Queen. I mean, all right.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosIdleInhouseFidget_HairFlick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sorry, Zagreus, I have to go. Lots of assignments as of late. Too bad I can't be everywhere at once.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"No use in making idle chat, right, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I have a job to do, and you've no interest in remaining here. See you around out there.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Don't bother, Zagreus. I was just leaving.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I hope you've thought through all of this. For both our sakes.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I can't keep bailing you out each time you get in over your head.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I have to say it's quite a mess you've gotten yourself into, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You better know what you're doing.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're wasting your time. Just go.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Shouldn't you be back out there by now, getting yourself killed?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You know how much trouble I am getting myself into here?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
There's nothing left for us to talk about.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Don't talk to me. Just go.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Excuse me, I've got work to do.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Not now, I have to go.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I don't know what you want from me.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I have to get back to my responsibilities.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You are in so much trouble.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You watch yourself out there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Take care of yourself.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I'll see you out there, I guess.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I hope all this is worth it.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
We'll meet again out there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I hope you know what you're doing.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Can't talk right now, I have to get to work.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I need to get to work. I'll see you later.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Your father's going to have my hide.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I am in so much trouble, you have no idea...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What have I gotten myself into, Zag...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Much as I would like to stay and chat, I'd better go.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Zag, I've got so many mortals on my plate right now...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"See you out there soon enough, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"If you stay out too long, I'm going to track you down.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Sounds like we've both been keeping plenty busy as of late.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Now that you're here, I can finally head out.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
We'll have to catch up more some other time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Sorry Zag, I'm due to get a bunch of mortals now.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Excuse me, Zag, just got word that I'm needed back up top.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Hope your father's going to be all right with all of this.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We showed those wretches last time, didn't we.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Good running into you out there, and glad you made it out.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Impressive that you went the distance once again.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Was good having an opportunity to back you up out there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I heard you did good work out there last time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"The shades are murmuring about your latest exploits, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Don't have a lot of time for catching up right now, here, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You're not in too much of a hurry, are you, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Well then... some mortal up there's lived a good, long life.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Mind if I practice my ability to shift short distances with someone else?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Well... I'd say that test was a success, wouldn't you?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have to shift away from here, though if you'd care to join me...",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Too bad I can't just shift you to the top, though this wasn't so bad.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey let's get out of here for just a bit, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Whew. Thanks for the break, now back to it, I guess.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Was just about to go on break, if you would care to join me.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Good catching up. Take care of yourself, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think you'd better head back to your quarters, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Mm. I'd best get back to my responsibilities for now.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is a private chat, if you'll excuse us, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"We'll see you later out there, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Just catching up on things with Megaera here, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We were just talking about you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Well if it isn't our mutual friend.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Enjoy the peace and quiet with us, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Just catching up with Thanatos, if you don't mind.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Discussing work-related matters, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Look who it is, Than. Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
We've been comparing notes about our latest tasks.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We're in the middle of a conversation, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Catch up with you some other time, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Bye!!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male

Great!!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...All right, I'd better get going. Take care, Brother.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Yep!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Looks like you have everything under control. Nice work, Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Haha, yeah!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Looks like you have everything under control. Nice work, Hypnos.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Farewell.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...We have another task for you.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"As you will, Mother. It will be done immediately, then.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Very well.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...Understood, Mother. Commencing the assignment now.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
...Your expertise is needed once again.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Then, very well, Mother. I'll begin right away, and be back soon.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Indeed.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I hear you, Mother, and obey. I will return when the task is complete.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Then, go.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Thank you for thinking of me for this task. I'll make it happen shortly.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thank you, my son.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...The task is clear to me, Mother. I go. Your will be done.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...It shall be as you say, my lord. I will report back soon.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Yes, my lord. I will begin, and not return until the deed is done.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...If that is all, my lord, then I will make way for the surface now.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...I understand, my lord. I know where they are and soon shall bring them here.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...I do appreciate your faith in me, my lord. Begging your pardon, please.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...This matter will be dealt with promptly, lord. I expect to return shortly.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It isn't much, Than, but I got you something.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You want me to take that off your hands, fine. But you are taking this from me, and if anybody asks, we're even. Or, scratch that, don't tell anyone about this, understand?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What, really...? Come on, what is this, Zagreus. You think handing this to me makes up for everything you've put us through?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It's just something I found out there that I thought you might like, Than. Don't think anything of it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why bother with such empty gestures, Zag. You've said you're getting out of here; best focus on that and leave me be.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It's not an empty gesture, Than. Besides, if I wasn't trying to stay focused, I'd be drinking it myself.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You shouldn't be doing this, Zag. You picked sides, and things are not the same. A momentary stab at thoughtfulness can't fix something like that.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We've been through a lot, Than, and I think we'll be going through a lot more yet. Consider it a token of our kinship.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't know what you're expecting, giving this to me. If there's a catch here, I don't want to know.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We've been through a lot, Than, and I think we'll be going through a lot more yet. Consider it a token of our kinship.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What is it with the generosity lately...? Look I'll just stash this with the rest if you really don't have a better thing to do with it than dump it off on me.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Hey, that's an idea. One of these days or nights, we'll have enough of this stuff to throw a feast to make all of Olympus jealous.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You can't be serious. You're serious...? Eh, you know what, fine. I'll take this and we'll go about our business. Though I don't see why you bother.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Why I bother? Why, how else can I show you how I feel except by handing you these bottles from time to time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Than. For all the times you've bailed me out, and just, all the times you've been around for me... I thought I'd get you this. The real thing.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ambrosia...! Zagreus, where did you even... don't you think this is a bit excessive?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You say that like it's a bad thing. Little bit of excess from time to time never hurt anyone I'm sure.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you would be surprised. Though if you're going to embarrass me, you know what, I am going to reciprocate. Behold!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Yeah, but I wanted to!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"For you, Thanatos. The Olympians might be accustomed to this stuff but I think we should have our share of it down here. At least you should.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know... the Olympians do have good taste in certain things. The last bottle you gave me... it was... better than expected. Though, I almost decided not to try it at all.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"But try it you did! And now, you'll get to try this one for comparison's sake. Each one's supposed to be different you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Different, huh. Well, then, I guess I'll have to see what you mean by that. Thank you, Zag. You didn't have to do this.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Than, wait...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I hope you're ready for some more of the real thing, there, Than, because I got you some, and I won't be taking 'Tsch, what is this, Zag' for an answer.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ugh, what is this? Come on, already, Zagreus, are you just messing with me, now? How did you even manage to get more of this, much less decide to hand it off to me?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"In order: no, I'm not; by ransacking my father's realm repeatedly; and it's because I like you, Thanatos. In case you still have some misgivings about that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You like me, Zagreus...? I never thought, I... don't know why that sounds so strange, coming from you. Given everything that's happened as of late.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Yeah. Look, if you don't feel the same way about me at this point, I would rather know. Cease all these coy gift exchanges, and all that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I never said anything like that! You know what, there's... a bunch of mortals I have to go fetch. Good-bye.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You too.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanatos, I wanted to apologize for the last time I approached you with a bottle of the real thing, and give the whole exchange another shot. Would that be all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hmph! You're asking my consent to give me yet another lavish gift? Sure! Permission granted. Though, what makes you think that your approach this time is going to be any more successful than the last?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I don't know that it will. I never really know exactly where I stand with you. But I know how I feel. And I'd rather be up front with you, even if it means risking our relationship, such as it is.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Our relationship? It wasn't long ago you were prepared to throw it all away while making for the surface, if you don't recall. But now you're saying that you care for me, and... what, exactly, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Yes, that's what I'm saying, Than. I should not have left the way I did, without letting you know. But when you found me, I... think that's when... that's when I knew. Or started to realize, you know?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I... yes. I know, I think, because... when I heard you took off, the anger that I felt, it was... it wasn't something I expected. So... ungh. What do we do now?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Maybe we ought to take our time? Unlike the real thing there, that's a commodity we have in good supply. Just know that, if you feel the way I do... you know where to find me. And if not... I'm grateful, anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I see. Well, then. The best that I can say for now is that... I'm grateful, too, for this. Take care of yourself, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I have to hand it to you, Zag, you're really putting in the work to get me to forgive you after all you've done. I'm honestly surprised.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Don't be. That feast of ours is really going to be something, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Thanatos is on assignment huh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Guess Than must be at work.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Where's Thanatos I wonder.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What, Thanatos, is this... you're really giving Mort to me? I... I'm deeply honored!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thank you, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I do indeed.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
Farewell.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Mother, is there something I can do to help, with all of this? I spend too much time away from the House. Please, let me know.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You are already doing what you can to help, my son. Continue doing so. Matters are at stake here concerning you and all of us. Your support and choices in this shape the outcome that shall come to pass.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I understand, and I will do my best. Thank you for taking care of everything. I've every faith in you, Mother. And in this House. Farewell.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Death approaches.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Death approaches.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It's time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Blood and darkness.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
In the name of Hades.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Death has come.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You called?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Life and death, one and the same.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I got you.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Quite a mess you've made here, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Death is inescapable.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thought I'd find you here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thought I'd drop in.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I have returned.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I have arrived.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I am here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Pardon the interruption.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Hello again.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I sensed your presence here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Did you miss me, Zagreus...?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"How goes it, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
The time has come.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Death has arrived.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Death is inevitable.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I found you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Looks like I got here just in time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I have returned.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I thought I'd find you here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"It's been a little while, hasn't it?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I happened to be in the area.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Why hello, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I have returned.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Back, you wretches.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Stand down.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You wretches are coming with me.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
This ends now.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Time to die.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Thanatos,droppedMale
Time is up.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Thanatos,droppedMale
I'll take care of it.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Thanatos,droppedMale
Good as done.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Thanatos,droppedMale
So be it.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Thanatos,droppedMale
"You might want to stand back, there, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Think you can beat me, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Let's slay these wretches quickly.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Can you deal death faster than I?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
What say we get things started.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Let's get to it, then.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Here come your Father's forces.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I'll handle this.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I'll make this quick.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Think you can beat me?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Who dies first?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
This won't take long.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
All of you; it's over.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I'll send you to the lowest depths.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Prepare yourselves.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"This one's on me, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"All of you, prepare to die again.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Together we bring death.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Together, like last time.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You brazen wretches ought to have turned back!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Come, wretches, and be returned to dust!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Who wants to be the first to die again?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You so-called champions could use a lesson in humility.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
All in Elysium should know of us by now.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Let's see how quickly we can wrap this up.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Let get things started, then.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I doubt this will take very long at all.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
And here they come.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"They're coming, Zagreus. Be on your guard.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Think you can beat me again, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What do you say we end this quickly, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Scared I'll take more of them than you this time?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"All of you, prepare to die again.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Here they come, fresh for the taking, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Don't be too reckless to outpace me, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You wretches never seem to learn, do you.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
No you don't.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
"That's not my style, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
One way to find out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's, by all means.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's find out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sounds good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Absolutely.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let them come.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Got it under control, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That was my plan.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Occasionally, yes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hopefully not me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No, it will not.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
He's not kidding.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll also do that!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You better!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You're too kind.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Excluding me I hope.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Yeah.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We have this!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You definitely ought!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Or I'll slay you instead if you prefer!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Not me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Lesson one: Don't mess with either one of us!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I know, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's see, indeed!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Race you, Than!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No doubt at all from me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
And here they fall!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'll get right on it, Than!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What do you think, Than?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I say: Sure, Than, sounds good to me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, absolutely terrified.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hope you don't mean me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, then, have at it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll be as reckless as I want!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
They really don't.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No you don't...!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
No you don't.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I got you...!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I got you.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Not yet...!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Not. Yet...!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I don't think so.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It's not your time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Not so fast.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Not a chance.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
No way.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Not if I can help it.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Live. Go.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Be more careful.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Wake up.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Watch it, damn you.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
On your feet.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Focus, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Keep fighting.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Keep going.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Get back in there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're not dying yet.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You're still alive, go!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It's not your time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're not finished.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're still in this.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Snap out of it...!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Megaera, here?!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What is this, Megaera?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We have this, Megaera.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Unnecessary, Megaera!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Megaera, again?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Megaera!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Megaera?!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Do I know him?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
What is he doing here?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Who is that?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Is he supposed to help?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"One of your friends, there, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That skeleton.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"The skeleton, again.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Sisyphus!!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Sisyphus?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Sisyphus, you dare?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That Sisyphus!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Him again?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Why ask for help from him?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Unnecessary, Zag!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Some help he was!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Dusa?!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Dusa!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Dusa, here?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Dusa, how?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What are you doing, Dusa?!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Achilles?!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Achilles!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Achilles, here?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Achilles, how?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What is this, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You again?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You again!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I told you to get out!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Stay out of this!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Begone!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Don't interfere!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're not authorized!,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Get out while you still can.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Really?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Back off.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Oh come on.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Cut it out.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Don't do that again.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Stop that.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That one was mine.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That was my kill.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I see how it is.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You took my kill.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Find your own targets.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Oh really.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Think you can beat me?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Dirty move.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Oh hoh.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Thanatos,droppedMale
So it's like that.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Get your own kills.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I had that one.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Life is short.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That's enough.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Enough.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Hmph.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
All right.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That's settled.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"That's settled, then.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That was the last of them.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That's quite enough of that.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Drove them back.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That's all of them.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I'll write this one off.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
This won't go on the record.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That settles that.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Hm. You still alive?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
...You're welcome.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Situation is under control.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're clear of them for now.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
We'll leave no trace of this.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
What chance did they have?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Chamber secured.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
And that's the end of that.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
We make a decent team.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Good working with you, there.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Short work, there, wasn't it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Been a pleasure.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Let's call this one a draw.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Huh, it's a tie.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You got as many as I did.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It's a draw.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Looks like we tied.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Another tie, huh.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"All right, all right, you got me.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You made short work there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Here, since you did all the work.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Guess you had this well in hand.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
How did you get so fast?,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Wow, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I can't believe this.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
That was embarrassing for me I have to say.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Not bad, Zag. Here.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Save some for me next time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You took more down than I did.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Got more of them than I did, huh.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You held your own out there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You held your own I guess.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're not too bad at this.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You're reckless, but you're quick.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You're fast, I'll give you that.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Here's something for the show.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You've gotten stronger, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Good work, my friend.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You earned this fair and square.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You beat me once again.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You got a lot of them.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I'll take more down next time.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Hang on to this for me.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...Thought you could just get away from me, did you?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Thanatos. I figured it was only a matter of time before Father sent you after me to do his dirty work.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Zagreus. Is that really why you think I'm here? Let's see how many of these exalted champions you can send back to their dooms, unless you'd rather I would send you back to yours.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Barely caught up with you, here, Zag. You must have had a little help from Hermes, I suppose.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You have the butterfly I gave to you. Stay back, then, and it'll make you stronger once I'm finished here.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Got little Mort with you, there, huh. Well, there's no need to summon me this time.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You're back. I thought you made it out. No matter.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Good to be working with you in a more official capacity, Zag. Shall we get started?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thought I might find you all the way out here. Although, quite frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I can hold my own in case you haven't noticed, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I haven't, Zag! Now, stand back, and let me show you how it's done.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Still at it, I see. You're stubborn. And you are going to get me in a heap of trouble before all is said and done.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"How about another of our little contests, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
We'll have to catch up at some other time. Though good to see you anyway.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I have a feeling this is not going to take much time at all.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I only have a little time until my next assignment, but this shouldn't take too long.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Thought I might stop by and check up on this corner of the Underworld, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You've come this far, now let's make sure you go the distance, Zag.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I heard there was a matter that required my attention here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Had a feeling I would find you all alone out here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Want to stand back and watch me work, here, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"This one is off the record, Zagreus. Come on!",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Looks like we've got an urgent work-related matter to attend to.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Your father's forces making trouble for you, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Not a word of this to anyone back home, you hear me, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I heard you got yourself into another mess that needed cleaning up.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"We'll catch up later, now let's deal with these wretches and be done.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Hope you don't mind if I cut in, here, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What say we go take care of business here just like we used to, Zag?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I can't stay long, so how about we get this business over with.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Figured you'd be up to have another of our little contests. Now let's go.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"What do you say we deal some death together, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Don't have much time, but let me see if I can pitch in.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Remember, not a word of this, to anyone. Let's go.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You look like you could use a hand.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Let's see who's better at this, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I got the feeling you could use some backup here.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Let's get this done.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"Good, I'm not too late. Got here as quickly as I could.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I got the message that you need assistance, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
<Sigh>,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You left, without so much as telling me good-bye. I suppose you knew I'd catch up with you sooner or later, is that it? No escaping death, and all?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I left when it was necessary, Than. I thought of you and hoped you'd understand. I have to do this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's more motivation than I've ever heard from you. Well, if you won't say it, I'll say it. Good-bye, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I've got to hand it to you, Zag. You're easy to track down. The shades of Tartarus are beginning to fear you even more than your Lord Father.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
Oh they won't fear me once they get to know me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

I don't know what I'm supposed to say when he gets like this...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What's with the look? You had your hands full, now you don't thanks to me... Tsch, seems I'm left to thanking myself, since you're too proud to do it.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male

I'm searching for my mother. You still live at home with yours. You don't know what it's like.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Listen to me. I don't know how else to put this, but, I want you to come home. Voluntarily. It's not just you swept up in all this nonsense now. And, I know you didn't ask for me to get involved, but, what did you expect?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
...Than. Home is never going to be the same for me. There's no use trying to pretend. I have to go.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You don't have to do anything of the sort. You have no idea how good you've had it here. Maybe someday you'll come to understand.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
ThanatosTalkDismissal_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is all right. Thanks, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Outdid me once again, there, huh. Tsch. I have to admit, you're not as bad at all of this as I expected. First I found you, I was certain that you had no chance at all.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I seem to have this whole easy-to-underestimate thing about me, based on a decent sum of my relationships. In any case, I always welcome your appearances out here. I know it's not been easy for you, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's fair as an assessment, I would say. But then again, it's never been an easy time for me. I know I have to do my job. But I don't have to keep on helping you, like this.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"...What, you're telling me this is it? You're just going to leave me to my own devices, then, I've proved myself to you, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Good to see you taking little Mort there on one of your strolls. Means I can better keep an eye on you out there.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male

"And I cannot believe you still remember that. Regardless, he will not be getting lost again under your supervision, accurate?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
You too.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"About when we last spoke. I care about you, Thanatos. A lot. Though, you asked what you are to me... how am I supposed to even answer that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ugh, I don't know. Sometimes I miss not feeling anything. Can't always trust what feelings say. I get to thinking, are we only friends, or... look, this is embarrassing.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"To think discussing feelings would be even harder than annihilating Father's forces. But... I've been asking myself the same thing, Than. If it's any reassurance.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, if you come up with any answers, I guess let me know. Good running into you.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I'm glad you did, though, Than.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey. I didn't mean to lay the guilt on you for what you did for Orpheus, Zag. I just worry when we get involved... we can make matters worse.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"You haven't ever made anything worse, Than. But as for me, I realized what you meant. I was so eager to do something for Orpheus when I first met Eurydice, I... never asked them if it was OK.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"At least things turned out well for them. But that was fortunate. Family troubles, personal relations, and the like... it's sensitive business. Though, who am I to talk. You didn't ask me to show up, like this.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
All right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Than, are you OK? I mean, with everything, lately?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I am. Though, thanks for asking, Zag. The risk of being close with anyone is sometimes things get complicated, fast. Admittedly it's not a risk I often take, but... in your case, it's been worth it, all in all. We're good, all right?",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
I know what you mean.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What are you doing back here, Zag? You made it out.",CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
"I did... but I had to come back. And, not exactly voluntarily. I'll be visiting up there from time to time, though... it looks like I'll be staying here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Visiting from time to time...? I don't understand.,CHARACTER,Thanatos,male
It's my mother. She's alive and well! It's just that I can't stay with her up there for very long! So we'll have to catch up... one visit at a time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

I am. And that stuff you heard about me isn't true.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Isn't there something I can do to help...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahaha, secret? I'm two weeks behind schedule with this place, at least! Fortunately, no one here seems very good at keeping time, so, no one's gotten on my case just yet, but... oh, you aren't going to tell, are you?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female

She's running herself ragged.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Dusa, wait, before you fly away... there must be something I can do, to help pitch in with everything? Doesn't matter how good you are at your job, what you're describing, that's more than one individual can handle!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Ooh, that might be my fault. I've been giving the Contractor lots of work. Some of those lounge orders must be coming from you, right? This place is really shaping up!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wha-wha, wait, then you're the one who's been authorizing all these improvements?! Oh my, oh my, aaaah!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female

"The lounge is really starting to look nice lately, Dusa! All your hard work is really paying off!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah! Why, thank you, Prince, it's just that, lately, the House Contractor's been slightly more agreeable I guess, working a little faster, maybe, but there's still a lot we have to do, so, you just wait!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Take care now!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Um, Prince Zagreus...? I just wanted to say something, if you have a little time? I know you're really busy... I can come back.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Wait, no, now's fine, of course, what is it, Dusa? I'm not so busy, by the way, and always happy to check in. Wait, is something wrong?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, nononono, it is just the opposite, I... can't believe you helped me, with the lounge. I don't think anyone has ever helped me out like you did, cleaning up after Cerberus, and the new rug, and the kitchen, and, just, all of this!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"It was my pleasure, really. All of us use the lounge, don't we? This House can really be a lot, but in the lounge here, things are easier a bit, I think. I'm so glad we have you watching over it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Y, you really mean that, Prince...? But you don't know what this means to me. I'm finally caught up on work! W, what am I going to do? I, I don't know what I'm going to do with all this extra time! I have to go, and plan everything out!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Bye, Dusa.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Um, Zagreus? I wanted to talk some more, if you're available? I mean, if you're free. I mean! If you have time to right now. Is that OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Of course, Dusa! Where should we chat? The lounge, or maybe somewhere more private...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Somewhere more private, please, if that's OK? Thank you.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...Um, Zagreus... so, ever since you told me you had feelings for me, it's been, like... my whole mind is on fire. I haven't been able to think straight, or get anything done. It's all been so much!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I do have feelings for you, silly! That's what I've been trying to tell you, it's just... it's just...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"It's just what...? Whatever it is, it's OK. You can be yourself with me, Dusa, I promise.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm glad you put it that way. I... I'm not looking for an intimate relationship. You're the kindest soul in this whole House. And I have learned so much from you! But, when I really think about my feelings... I'm just, not attracted to you, in that way. I'm sorry. You're a really nice guy!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, hahaha, look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief. I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't say that! Though, I was going to ask you the same thing. I'd really like it if you'd be my friend! Though, my career comes first, so... I don't want you doing any special favors, promise me? I need to see how far I can get on my own.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I respect that so much, and yes, I promise, Dusa. So, well, then... friends? For all eternity?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes. Friends. For all eternity. Now... I had better go. See you, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, Zagreus, I... wanted to talk to you again, I... what I mean is, I just, hope I didn't hurt your feelings, because, if I did, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Dusa, please! Remember friends for all eternity? That's a long time, so, there's no need for second guessing. I'm glad we had a chance to talk.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, well, good! That's a relief to hear, but... one last thing, so I can clear my conscience of it, I... I've saved all the Ambrosia that you gave me, and I figured since... I didn't realize, you know, the way you felt? I can be a little dense! I have it here. And I would like to give it back. Is that OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I... look, if you don't want the Ambrosia anymore, and receiving it made you feel uncomfortable in any way, I'll take it back. It was my gift to you, to do with as you please. Are you sure you don't want it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, I'm sure, and thank you for your understanding, Prince. It really was quite sweet of you, but it's important that I learn to stock the lounge myself. So, here you go, and I will see you soon, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, now, there's no need to do anything rash like that! That Ambrosia was my gift to you, and it was unconditional. Just try the stuff and see! They say the purer the act of giving, the better it is. Won't you keep it? If not for yourself, then for the lounge?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, all right, I... had to ask, so, thanks again. Just wanted to make sure! I hope we can enjoy it at the lounge sometime!! I'd better go put it away. Not drink it! Store it for safe keeping, now, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, um, Zagreus? I wanted to say, that was very sweet of you, letting me hang onto all that Ambrosia you gave me before? It's in safe keeping now! Except one bottle... that kind of slipped, and broke. Though that did mean I got to try the stuff!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, you got to try it, after all? What did you think, all it's cracked up to be?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It was amazing. I've never had anything like it! It's so good to have a forked tongue, meant I could taste it twice at the same time! So, um... if one of the other bottles slipped and broke... you wouldn't mind, would you?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Ah, thank you, Dusa.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, I can't shake this feeling, so I wanted to apologize to you, because... I think when we first met, I just... I don't think I took it the right way. I never had a fan before! I wanted to live up to your idea of me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Prince, Zagreus, don't worry about that! Even I didn't know what I was going through. When I first started working here, I was just so impressed with you, I mean... you were the only one who would stand up to your father! I thought about you all the time!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"But you didn't even know me, yet. We didn't get to talking for what seemed like ages. You can be difficult to find! Since I can't fly up to the rafters like you can.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well I'm so glad you kept trying to talk to me! If you hadn't... I'd probably be up in the rafters still, building up this idea of you that's not even as good as the real thing!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey Dusa, something I was wondering, and it's just curiosity, mind you, but... is there somebody else...? I mean, somebody special, whom you're close with, or would like to be. Romantically, I mean. If it's all right to ask.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you can ask me anything! But, um, somebody else romantically, not really, no? It's not really my thing? It doesn't mean I don't have feelings for you, though! You know that, right? I wouldn't drop what I'm doing and throw myself at danger for just anyone, you know!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I definitely know. There's seven kinds of love, or so, isn't that right? It isn't something that's taught extensively down here, though, so... there's still a lot for me to learn, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wow, I never thought of it as love until you said it there just now, Prince, but you're right! I love you, Zagreus! Hah, haha, that feels good to come right out and say, you know? OK, well, bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I hope it's not been too much, having to care for Cerberus, is it, Dusa? He isn't quite as fearsome as he seems. At least, that goes for two heads out of three!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Oh, Cerberus is a good boy, he's fine! One of the highlights of the job, for sure. We really hit it off after he finally realized I'm not a ball! So, I've been feeding him, grooming him, changing his water dish...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
...Cleaning up after him...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Most definitely, yes. If you'll excuse me, by the way? He's got to go. I mean! I've got to go! I mean!! You know what I mean, bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Ungh, Dusa... it's a little much out there sometimes, I have to say. Different stresses than in here, but still.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh don't you lose hope now, Prince Zagreus! There isn't anything you couldn't handle, I just know! You're every bit as tough as your father, except, you're nice! And you never back down from anything. You can do this!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...I don't know that anyone can do this. No escape from the Underworld and all that. Though, thanks for cheering me up.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm not just saying it, I mean it, Prince! Look at how far you've come! Practically everybody in this House believes in you! Even the Wretched Broker and the Head Chef! Oh, I've asked them! Everybody thinks you're going to succeed!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Can I ask you a couple of purely figurative questions here, Dusa? First, what have I gotten myself into...? And second, what am I going to do...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Believe me, I know the feeling, being in over my head! Though, if I can find my way out of my messes, then I know, I know, you definitely can! I don't know what you ought to do, but I am always here to listen.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You know Achilles reasonably well, don't you, Dusa? Seems like he's always stuck there in that hall. At least you get to fly around. Sometimes I think he wishes he was someplace else.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There has to be a way to help him, Prince! He's been so loyal to this House, and he has to be your truest friend of everybody here. But he's the pity-party type. He needs someone to get him out of this!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Woo-hoo!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, Prince, I heard the news about Master Achilles, that's so great! I'm going to miss him being here as often as he used to, but I'm just so happy for him, and for you!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Me too, Dusa. The happy-for-him part, at any rate! He's a good friend, and he deserved much better than to be stuck here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, yes, absolutely, thanks for asking, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Erm, Ms. Dusa, I ran into hostile gorgons that resembled you out there in Asphodel. Resembled only in the vaguest sense, I mean, they lacked your charm or social graces, anyway. I just, hope you are not related, since I sort of... you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hahaha, those old things? They're relatives just in the loosest sense, like... say you had some nasty, almost mindless siblings born entirely from your own blood, something like that? Do you have any idea how hard it was to get a steady job because of them?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
So I have your permission to continue hacking down such gorgons with impunity?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Maybe it is!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I had another question about your relationship to other gorgons, Dusa. So... I notice you're not much for hissing, snakelike noises when you speak, and so on? Is that some sort of special gorgon language or something?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, um, not exactly, Prince! It's what it sounds like, hrrrsssss!! Just, scary hissing, really, takes some practice not to sound like that with a forked tongue! I really wanted to fit in. Hey, how about you? Always wondered how come you have a surface accent. Weren't you born here?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, wait, me? I never gave it any thought. I... guess it's from my father. He insisted that he teach me how to speak, himself. Maybe it's in the blood.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Dusa, this is kind of personal, and you don't have to answer, but I have to know. So... did you... use to have a body, and all that? Because, I've heard of gorgons, well... that you had wings, and such?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Um, Prince, so, look. That's something very private that you're asking, and... I know you don't mean any harm, but it just isn't something I discuss with anyone, OK? I'm who I am. Besides! As you can see, I don't need wings to fly!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Ms. Dusa, I, erm, wanted to apologize for when I pried about your past. I just wanted to get to know you better, but... I was insensitive, and I'm sorry.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Your Highness, Zagreus, come on! Don't even worry about it! I'd already forgotten, really no big deal. It's just, the past me, it's as though... it wasn't even me. This is me, now! I'm glad I'm here.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You know, it must be pretty handy, being able to turn somebody into stone. Is that something you can just do whenever you please, like... I don't know, sticking out your tongue or something?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not quite as easy as all that, but not so hard! You have to get yourself pretty worked up, and picture what you're seeing like a... well, um, like a picture, really, and then, fwoop! Stone statue. It's funny, I used to think everybody could do it!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Yay, you did it!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, Prince, I saw that Orpheus, he got some time away, did you do that? He's visiting his muse, that's what he said! That's so exciting, I mean, they've been separated the whole time they've been dead!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"They have a lot of catching up to do, for sure. Though I think they're going to be all right.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll just keep talking to him so no one else has to.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Do you have to work with Hypnos pretty closely as part of your job, Dusa? Feels like I've been running into him a lot lately.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Mister Hypnos, I have trouble getting through to him, I think? He gives me plenty of advice, it's just, it isn't really why I talk to him. I... only talk to him when I don't have a lot of other choice, I guess.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, Prince, is-is it really true? About Miss Meg and you, I mean, that you're, you know, um, I? You know!! Because, if so, then I want you to know, I'm just so happy for the two of you! That's wonderful, you two!! I'm so glad!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Erm, thank you, Dusa, I know you and Miss Meg are close, so, I am grateful that we have your blessings. Though, we're kind of... not out in the open with it, necessarily, so if you please, just... keep it quiet for us, would you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you better believe it, I will tell nobody whatsoever, no! I'll just be very, very happy to myself! All right, then! Bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, I saw you and Thanatos recently, Prince! You two, if you don't mind me saying, you are quite the pair, I mean, you ought to see yourselves! You're, whew...! Makes me a little woozy just remembering it now! Well, up I go, then, bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Dusa, I don't mean to upset you but, I'm worried you're going to burn yourself out if you keep pushing yourself past your limits... are you sure you don't need a break?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I, I'm sure, Prince. This is my chance! I'm custodian of the House of Hades! I need to keep doing my best right now. Thanks so much for the Nectar! Bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh hey, you brought some fish, could smell it all the way from down the hall, that's great!! The Head Chef can take it off your hands, should be right in the back of the lounge like always! Thanks for helping us out, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Say, Dusa, in your work around the House, you wouldn't happen to have run into a Skelly character, out in the courtyard, there, have you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Not really, um, because, my work is in the House itself, and, well, the courtyard, technically, it's kind of right outside, so, I'm supposed to stay inside the walls. But, I think I know who you mean! I've seen him, standing there just past your chamber doors. Why, is he OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Have to tell you, Dusa, your job seems really stressful, here. It's a big House! You have to tend to the entire thing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Well, most of it isn't so bad at all, but... ever since Cerberus tore up the lounge, I... guess it's been a little hectic, getting everything back to normal like before!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I'm not sure it was ever normal around here, but... I'm sorry I created work for you. Cerberus tore the place apart because of me. Though, maybe I can help you patch things up?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't say that, Prince! Cerberus knows better, and besides, you have your job to do, don't you? And I have mine! And I will do my very best at it, just wait and see!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Dusa, there is something you should know about me. Me and Nyx, that is. She's not my real mother...! My real mother's called Persephone. She's out there, somewhere. On the surface. That's why I left. Wait, just a moment, are you laughing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Haha, oh, uh, no, it's just, uhh... I'm really, really, really sorry, I can't help it, I, um, didn't want to interrupt, because, I kind of knew all that, already? Um, meaning, I had heard about it, everybody talks, you know, from time to time? But I just... really hope you find her soon!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Dusa, I just can't, right now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, there is something you should know about me. Me and Nyx, that is. She's not my real mother...! My real mother's called Persephone. She's out there, somewhere. On the surface. That's why I left. Wait, just a moment, are you laughing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Haha, oh, uh, no, it's just, uhh... I'm really, really, really sorry, I can't help it, I, um, didn't want to interrupt, because, I kind of knew all that, already? Um, meaning, I had heard about it, everybody talks, you know, from time to time? But I just... really hope you find her soon!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I trust you not to mention this to everybody in the House, but... I have. Found her, that is! I'm... trying to figure out what happens next. Can't really talk about it yet, so... bear with me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whooa, that is exciting, what's she really like? Is she tall? Does she have your eyes? Where does she live? What does she do? Does she have a job? What color is her hair? Is she, you know, is she with anybody?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
It is! It's both OK and great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, why, Prince, you're... wait, you're back? I mean, I thought...! I heard that...! How come you're still here?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, hah, yes! I made it pretty far! On that account you heard correctly, Dusa, but... turns out I have unfinished business here, so... I should be turning up like this from time to time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh wow, well, that's great!! I mean, I hope it's great? I mean, if you agree it's great, I also think it's great! If that's OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Don't worry, you're not missing much.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, in my father's chambers, he... he has a bedside portrait of somebody. Is... is she someone with whom you are familiar?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Prince, I'm not permitted in your father's chambers, are you kidding me? I'd ask you what it's like in there, but... I don't think I'm supposed to know!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Dusa, wherever did you get that Fidi Companion you gave me? You know how much that thing is worth? To me at least, I don't know who collects those anymore, but I sure do!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! I'm so glad you like her, Prince! I could think of no one better to take care of her, and best of all... she'll remind you of me! But as for where I got her, you're not going to believe it... can you guess?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"What, wait, you don't mean... no, not from Nyx, herself? Did you, wait, Dusa... you didn't, how to put this, borrow her from Nyx, did you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Haha, no! Happen to value my job, here, among other aspects of my well-being, but... after the lounge assignment, Nyx herself commended me, and gave me Fidi as a nice reward! Although, she probably knew I'd just end up giving her to you!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"How's your relationship with Nyx been lately, Dusa? She strikes me as a pretty intense supervisor. You getting on OK?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Miss Nyx? I'll do whatever she says! Why, did she say something about me? She did, oh, why would you be asking otherwise, oh no. Am I losing my job?!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, no, no no, it's not like that, it's just... a feeling that I've had from glimpses of the interactions that I've seen between you two. I haven't always got along with Nyx, but I know she cares deeply about this House and everyone in it. Including you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahaha, well, that's nice to know! She cares about my work performance, that's for very sure, and I am doing everything I can to live up to and exceed her expectations, tell her that!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Aah! The Prince! Miss Nyx, she, I, I'm not supposed to talk to you! I have to go!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Dusa, hey, hey what's the matter, you seem... something's wrong, what happened? Tell me, please.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, Your Highness, you... you're not supposed to talk to me, I mean, I'm not supposed to talk to you, you see, Miss Nyx, she... oh, I will be in so much trouble, now!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Wait, Dusa, slow down, what is the matter? Nyx really has forbidden you from even speaking with me? Do you know on what grounds?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've no idea, Prince, I, look... I really want to keep my job here, so, I can't, I can't be seen with you right now, like this, please understand, I have to go, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
This isn't working...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, I... think that Nyx has some concerns... maybe with me, because it's like you said, she doesn't want us talking here like this. Is she... not satisfied with the work you've been doing, or something?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, Prince, no, it isn't you, it's definitely me! There's all these things she said I need to work on, calmness, not making so many lists, putting things into perspective, not working myself too hard, not taking blame for things that aren't my fault...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Those sound like reasonable goals, though I just wish that Nyx could find a way to tell you that wasn't so upsetting. Won't you take care of yourself, Dusa, please?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...And plus, she said I'm not supposed to talk to you, she said that too, oh, I am going to be in so much trouble, aah!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I, um, Prince, I... wanted to say good-bye, because... it's my last day. Or night? Um, anyway, it's really been a pleasure, knowing you, and working here, and so...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Wait, wait, wait, what exactly happened, your last day or night, what is all this? You're really leaving? Why?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I lost my job! Miss Nyx, she... it's her final word, and so... I need to go, before I make things any worse. Farewell, Highness! Farewell...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Prince, I... hi, again, I guess... I guess I'm back? At work, here, once again?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Imagine my relief. I'm glad that Nyx has come around. I... understand she was concerned, but... I hope she never looks past all your good qualities like that again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I hope so, too. I'm glad to have my job back. It's hard work, and I know there's more to life, such as it is, than this, but... it matters a lot to me, you know? I have to do this, so... I'm glad that all of you are letting me.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"So, what even happened when you lost your job, Dusa? Did you have someplace else to stay? Was everything all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, it's funny, after I was fired... at first, I just couldn't believe it, I... felt lost! But, after a few days or nights, it's like, it opened up my eyes, you know? Suddenly, I had all this time to myself, and... what I realized was, I was... so, so tired. I think I really needed the break.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
I'm surprised you wanted to come back to work after something like that. Wouldn't you be totally fed up? Burned out on the whole thing?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I love this work too much to get burned out, Prince. But that's me. I know there's more to being alive or being dead than just your work, but... my work happens to be important to me. And besides... if I don't push myself from time to time, how can I ever know my limits, right?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"But if you go too far beyond your limits, things can get bad. Believe me. I mean, you almost lost the job you care so much about.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're right, I... need to be more careful, not to push myself too hard, too often. Hey, could I ask a favor? Would you tell me if I go too far with work again?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"How's work lately, Dusa? You seem to have a handle on your new responsibilities, or so I hear from Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh yes, it's going pretty well, so far, I think! I have some new accounting duties, though I've parceled everything, and got a budget for a little extra help. It's funny, I-I should be busier than ever, but... I have more time to spare, lately, and things are good, I guess?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
You're doing great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, hey, I wanted to congratulate you! Saw you were chosen as the featured servant of the House, getting your portrait there, right in the lounge for all to see! That's quite an honor!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, haha, it's really nothing, Prince, something that anybody could have done really, as long as they were fired up to do their very, very best, all the time, with a positive attitude, and without worrying too much about the overwhelming amount of work that still needs to be done!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
I guess we are...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, Prince! Persephone, your mother, wow, she's, woww...! It's no wonder you wanted to try to find her. She's something else! Although, I guess you didn't know that till you met her, huh? But, still!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"It's definitely an adjustment, with my mother here. Especially for her! I'm glad the two of you are getting on all right. I guess things will be different, now, but... hopefully, it's for the better, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Are you kidding?! Ah, didn't mean to be so rude, it's just, I think it's definitely better, now! We're like a complete team!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Bye...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Um, Prince, so, is it... really true, then, that you're staying, and... that you'll be working here, officially, I guess?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I... well, when you put it that way, yes, I guess it is! We're going to try and make it work like this, for now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well you know what this means, don't you? We're official co-workers now!! Isn't that so exciting? We can share our latest learnings, compare notes about the challenges we're up against, run into one another in the hall...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Dusa... we've been doing everything you said this entire time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But it is not the same! The entire feel of it's completely different, now! You'll see! So, OK!! Bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Yeah... thanks, though.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I think I finally know a little more about how you must feel, Dusa. Working for Father, I mean. I was so intent on running away from here, but... here I am.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, Prince, um... your father's always been a pretty scary god. And, this is something between you and him. Though, if you can forgive him, I guess... it means you'd stay? And I would like that, so... that's where I stand! I know it's really complicated, though.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Well, you did amazing here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, this whole place, it looks immaculate! That's even after all Olympus came here for that giant feast? How did you get everything clean so fast?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, ha-hah! Well! I guess I have my ways, Prince. Sometimes you get one of those jobs and you just want to give it everything you've got, you know? I get a lot of jobs like that! Feeding Cerberus, cleaning the rafters! But this one? I just knew it was the perfect job for me!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, uh, hey there, Dusa! How's your endless toil treating you?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Um, Mister Hypnos, do you... maybe think that you could, you know, uh, keep an eye on the procession line before Lord Hades? Like you were supposed to...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh! Um, that's no problem, I can definitely do that, I'll just add it to the list!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Um, good, then! Glad we had a chance to chat. Now, maybe get some sleep or something. You look pretty beat...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Goodbye!!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Mister Hypnos, I, uh, wanted to check in with you again, regarding the procession line that's... right in front of you, right over there, it's... moving pretty slow.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I know! Those shades, they just go on and on, and on and on, forever, blathering about this or that! I mean, Lord Hades, it's a wonder he can stand it, listening to them every day or night!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Um, well, it's just, I think you were supposed to keep things moving, so, if they're taking too long, I guess that maybe you could say something, or... any bright ideas?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"It's a toughie, Dusa, because I think it's important that the shades who wait their turn, why, that they get a chance to say their piece! But it's a real tricky situation you bring up, so, let me tell you what I'm going to do: I am going to sleep on it! And then, get back to you!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"OK, well... if you don't, though, I'll check in with you again, later, I guess? Because, I'm under orders, so... um... bye...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
You bet!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Heya Dusa, let me guess! You're here regarding the procession of these shades, who have been standing here for quite some time, clogging the hall a bit... they've barely moved at all!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"Y, you guessed it, Mister Hypnos, so... have you, um, given any thought to maybe focusing the traffic flow through here a little bit, to keep the hallway clearer, and, oh, I don't know, put some sort of time limit in place?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You know, can't say I have! I've got my registration list, and I have had to keep a careful eye on it, with all the shades that have been pouring in? It's really gotten slow around here!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"It definitely has, I... have to go, um, hope you get yourself some rest, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Mark it away!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can't believe it, Mister Hypnos, how... how did you do it? All the shades that have been lining up, they... they've been moving right along!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You know, you're right, they have! They definitely have. It's pretty hard to notice, since they're slow, but I have a keen eye. And so do you! You noticed before I did in this case. What did you say your question was back there?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"I asked you how you did it, got the traffic flow moving a little faster, and... it's the sarcophagus things, isn't it? Right down the hall! The shades, they're scared to stand around! That's brilliant, Mister Hypnos, I'm impressed!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, hahaha, that, well, really, it was nothing, Dusa! Though, I'll tell you something! It is good to know that you're impressed with me!",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"I, haha, don't know if I'd go that far, um, anyway! I'll mark this as resolved!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...And after that, Dusa, you are to clean the rafters once again, and prune the gardens thoroughly. By then it should be time to tend the kitchens, and sweep the lounging area a second time...",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Y, yes, right away!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...Lastly, Dusa, you are not permitted to address the Prince, unless first spoken to. You are invisible to him. Now, are we understood?",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Yes, Miss Nyx, we're understood, I mean... I understand. I, I'll be going, then.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Do your best work.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Hooray...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Miss Nyx, you're...? Do I want my job again, I... wha, I, more than anything! This job, it, it means everything to me, I mean, working with you? You are the Night Itself! This place, and all of you, all of it, it's so amazing to me, and I just... I, just I want to help! Just, give me one more chance!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Your one more chance has certain stipulations, Dusa. If you think it is necessary to exceed the allotted time for your responsibilities, I expect you to ask. You are not the sole bearer of this House's fate. Your temperament toward your work is as important as the end result. Now then... I would ask that you return to your post.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, I, Miss Nyx, you mean... like, start right now? Now now? I mean, I, I don't have a lot of pressing obligations, so, I'll do it, yes!! I accept! I'm so excited to be back! Where do I even start, I can survey the lounge, sweep the cobwebs, walk Cerberus, check the pantry, ah, OK, I'm off!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Thank you!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Well deserved.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...and, therefore, for your diligence and service, and for having demonstrated such improvement... by my authority as Night Itself, I hereby name you Chief Custodian of the House of Hades, and appoint to you the privileges implied. Bear the responsibility with honor, Dusa.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Miss Nyx, I am truly honored, and, I'm very grateful for this opportunity, and for the trust you've placed in me, in this expanded role. I promise you, I will not let you down. Not you, or anybody here! Thank you so much!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You are most welcome. The orderliness of this House is a reflection of the realm as a whole. You have internalized this, and understood that a disciplined approach toward work is far more valuable than mere exertion of effort. Although, you understand the need for exertion, as well.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...And then, all seven of those wretches tried cutting to the front of the procession line, can you believe the nerve? As though they'd get an audience that way.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ha, hahah, what a bunch of dummies! What were they even thinking, cutting the line, I mean, in front of you?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Let's just say, if they still have any complaints for our Lord Hades, they'll be waiting for a long, long time before they get the chance to bring them up.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...I swear you're right that one is such an idiot...! Though anyway, I'd best get back to work. Next round's on me, Dusa, and you take care.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You take care, too, Miss Meg, thanks for the drink! Bye now...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"What are you, kidding me? Of course!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...Follow your heart? That's odd advice, especially from you. Though, no offense intended.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I just mean, if you don't believe in the work you're doing, why keep on doing it, just out of obligation? You have to take care of yourself.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I don't think there's any rush for that. We won't just shrivel up and die in forty years like mortals do. But, I know what you're saying. I'll think about it, Dusa. Thanks.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Hey, look, I understand. I really do.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...We got off on the wrong foot from the start. Just what happens when you're born of Titan blood, I guess. It's for the best we haven't crossed paths much since.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"But they're your sisters, I mean... they're family! You must have something in common, some way of, I don't know, seeing eye to eye?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You're more my sister than they are to me, Dusa. I don't always agree with Lord Hades but I am thankful that they're not permitted in this House.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You're right. And same to you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...You sure that you're all right, with everything? I just... I wouldn't want you to be caught up in the middle of all this. If you so much as said to call it off...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"No, nononono, no, Meg, no! No, Meg! Come on, now, are you kidding me? I mean, I couldn't be happier about it, really! You deserve this! As long as you're happy, yourself, right?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Well, thank you, Dusa. You've always been so kind. I don't quite know what to say.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Hey, now, that's my line! Look, though, I better get going, but, I just want to say this is great news, all right? Thank you for telling me!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
She's got this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Would that all my subjects exhibited such promptness. Your report, then, if you please, Dusa?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Sir! The office currently is running smoothly, sir! Lounge attendance is up by twenty-eight percent, with customer satisfaction ratings in the eightieth percentile. No issues to report at this time.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"See that we achieve thirty percent before the turn of the aeon, Chief Custodian. Other than that... a satisfactory report. Now, carry on.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Thank you, in turn!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Um, it's my great pleasure to make your acquaintance. Call me Dusa, please! I, I'm your House custodian? And I am at your service! Anything you need, just call, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Dusa! Wonderful to know you! This House is immaculate! Night-and-day difference from before. Now I know exactly whom to compliment.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female

"I'm just keeping busy busy busy here like always, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I, I, I, I'm sorry that you died again out there, Your Highness...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, um, hi! Is... everything all right, there, Prince?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Nothing gets dirty around here while I am on the job, Your Highness...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Don't worry, Prince! I'll keep an eye on things!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You can count on me, Your Highness!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Anything I can do for you right now, or, maybe later...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...let's see, I did the dishes, fed the heads, cleaned the cupboards, cleared the pool...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, Prince, um, I'm supposed to be at work, so, I can't talk, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Excuse me, sorry, I just have to file this report, it's very late!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I, I, I have everything here well under control, Highness!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"What, is something wrong, Prince? I'll look into it, right now, up there!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Am I in trouble for something again, or, no...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"I'm always at 110%, hah, hahah!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Um, I, I, I, I'm sorry, I, I better get back to my cleaning...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female

NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah! Haha, got me again, Prince, sneaking up on me like that!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You'll get them next time, Prince, I'm sure of it! I think?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Just making sure the lounge is squeaky clean!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
This is going to be the best lounge in all the Underworld!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You let me know if you see any dust around here, won't you, Prince?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"You rest assured I'm not even remotely tired, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Please count on me for all your household needs!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
I'll make sure Cerberus has everything he needs while you're out!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Don't tell me I'm in trouble, am I, Prince?!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Just thought I'd mention, I, I really love this job!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"...stocked the store room, checked the locks, cleaned the tiles, watered the trees...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female

"I hope you have a great whatever time it is out there, Highness!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
I will definitely keep an eye on things while you are out!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Just in the middle of a wall-to-wall inspection right now, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Heard everything's been good lately between you and Miss Meg!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Eternal friends forever, right, Prince Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"So glad to see you back here, Your Highness!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Made sure the House was nice and tidy for you, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Your Highness, hi! All's well here, nothing to report!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Looks like we've both been keeping busy, huh, Your Highness?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Whew, I have been so busy, lately, Prince! The same as you!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Sorry, not much time to chat more right now, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"We'll have to catch up in the lounge sometime, huh, Prince?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Oh, haha, you startled me, there, Prince!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hold on, Prince! Think I saw some dust I missed up there!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female

"We'll have to chat some other time, here, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You get rest from time to time, for me, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
I hope you get to see Miss Meg out there next time!,CHARACTER,Dusa,female

"You know you can just let us talk without being interrupted, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"This particular discussion doesn't concern you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...Sometimes, though, Dusa, he's not the best at taking hints...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female

ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"P-P-Prince, I'm really grateful for this, really, and I thought, I, kind of got something for you...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wh-whaaaa, b-but, there must be some mistake, I, Prince, you're giving this to me...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I want you to know we all appreciate you, Dusa. Don't work yourself too hard on my account, OK?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ohh, oh, oh, oh my, Your Highness, are you... are you really sure you want me to have this?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female

"B-b-but, Prince, I, don't know what to say, I... are you joking around with me, maybe...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I am deadly serious, Dusa, honest. It's for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"OK, bye...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, you must work harder than anyone in this House, keeping everything so neat and orderly. I don't think it should be thankless work, so, thank you! And I'd like for you to have this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, Prince, wow, thank you! Thanks so much!! You've been so generous, I... I think I'm speechless! No, can't think of anything to say right now!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you said it all! Don't mean to put you on the spot or anything. I'm just glad we've had a chance to get to know each other.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I... I'm glad we've had a chance to know each other, too. Thanks for the Nectar! I can tell it's really, really good! Um, OK, bye!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Well, you enjoy, all right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Dusa? Here's some more of this really, really good Nectar for you! Please keep up the wonderful work, and more importantly, keep being your wonderful self.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I, I, I, I'm really very flattered, Prince, but, I've just been so busy, lately, that I haven't even had a chance to try the last bottle you gave me, so... you want this back, maybe for someone else?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Please, it's yours! Besides, you must have some time off coming up when you can enjoy it, don't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh! I mean, maybe I do? I think maybe I do, except, nobody's told me anything about that, and besides, there's so much work to do around the House still, I just can't leave everything like this!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
"Hey, Dusa? Congratulations on completing your assignment with the lounge. Look at this place! It's better than ever. All thanks to your effort and dedication. Here, this is for you. Something special for the occasion.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, I, this, this is Ambrosia, Prince! But, this is for gods...! This isn't for... someone like me? But, wait, wait wait, no, here, I'm going to do it, I am going to do it, here, take this!! I got it, just for you, so, take it, please! Farewell!!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Dusa, wait...!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ambrosia isn't only for the gods, you know, Dusa. It's for anyone we really care about. So, here. Please, enjoy this, or... just add it to the lounge's stash. Whatever suits you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I, but, you... really mean that, huh...? But, you're the Prince himself, and I'm just... look, we both know I am just a floating monster head. And a custodian. I just don't understand. Why keep on being nice to me, like this? I thought you'd never even talk to me...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You're so much more than what you said. I wish you could see that. If only everybody in this House had your spirit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah. If only everybody in this House had yours, Prince Zagreus. You've been so kind to me, and I'm glad we've had a chance to get to know each other more. It's really nice, sometimes... knowing somebody really cares about me here?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It should be more than sometimes that you feel that way, as far as I'm concerned. I just... I've never met anybody like you before. My father always told me not to smile quite as much, but... you're like me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, because I smile, haha? Smiling's just a little something that I like to do to deal with the day! Though, oh, that's what you meant, I... oh, I see. I, look, this is kind of a lot, I, I had better go...! I'll cherish the Ambrosia, though, OK?!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"See you, Dusa.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I got you more Ambrosia, Dusa, and I hope this is OK. I figure maybe you could use this for the lounge? Special events, guests, that sort of thing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I'm sorry that I flew away last time you brought me something like this, Prince... I mean, Zagreus. It's really strange for me to call you that, I... when I started here, they told me not to even speak with you, and now, uh... here we are...!",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, look, if I listened to everything I was told, my life would be a lot different and a lot worse off, I think! So... who cares what anybody says? I enjoy your company.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And I enjoy yours, too! Wasn't long ago that I was just a lonely gorgon head, all by myself in the big Underworld, looking for steady work. And then, I heard about the opening here, in your father's House? Well I got it! It seemed too good to be real. And then, there was you...",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I remember when we first met. You were carrying three bowls for Cerberus and bumped right into me. It all went flying, but you cleaned up half of it before it hit the ground. Then flew away before I got your name. I thought I'd never see you again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was so embarrassed! Worse... I thought I was done for, here. But, I got another chance! That was your doing, wasn't it? You've been looking out for me, all this time! That's so sweet of you, I... I don't know how to thank you, I... I, I better put this Ambrosia away, for safe keeping, OK?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
See you soon.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Dusa, I was thinking that this batch of Ambrosia ought to hold the lounge over for quite a while! Keep things livelier for everyone. And, please take a bottle for yourself, won't you? As a token of my affection.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Y-you said your affection, huh, I... wow! I... really like you, also, Zagreus. I liked you from the start! You were so different from your father, and Miss Nyx, I could just tell, but... wait, what am I saying, I am such a dummy! You're just being friendly with me, right...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I would be more than that, if it pleased you. You're very wonderful, and... you light up this House. But I would never risk our friendship, so, if this is where we draw the boundary, please, just let me know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Um... wait, wait. Wait, wait. Did you just say I'm... wonderful?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I did, indeed. And I am glad to get it off my chest, if you must know! Though... what about you? How do you feel?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I, wow, I, I never thought you'd... have those kinds of feelings, for somebody like me. It's really nice to hear! It makes me feel complete. But, um, Zagreus, I don't know if I can be what you need, I mean? Wait. You weren't, you weren't just being nice to me for all this time, because...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What? No, no, Dusa, of course not, I... ungh, why is it so damn difficult to share one's feelings with somebody else? I don't want to ruin what we have. If only you could see what's in my heart.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hahaha, I was just checking, don't feel bad, OK? You don't seem capable of hiding what's in your heart. And I mean that in the best possible way. I'm so happy, it's just... all this is a lot, and, I'm on duty right now, but... see you soon...?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh no, no no no, Your Highness, are you, really giving this to me?",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
NPCMedusaEmbarrassed,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, yes I am, Ms. Dusa, and I hope you enjoy it. Be seeing you, OK?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No sign of Dusa.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Dusa's probably cleaning the rafters.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Dusa's not here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"A Chthonic Companion!! Dusa, really? You're the best!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanks, Ms. Dusa.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ms. Dusa, I, um, wanted to apologize, for when I pried about your past. I just wanted to get to know you better. But I was insensitive, and I'm sorry. Please forgive me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Your Highness, Zagreus, come on! Don't even worry about it! I'd already forgotten, really no big deal. It's just, the past me, it's as though... it wasn't even me. This is me, now! I'm glad I'm here.",CHARACTER,Dusa,female
Gguhhhhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Why good to see you, Charon mate! Just minding my own business, taking in the sights, and, hey what's that you got, some sort of wares for sale? Then, I'll just have a look around.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Gguhhhhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Why good to see you, Charon mate! Just minding my own business, taking in the sights, and, sure is awfully convenient to be running into you like this! I'd all this coin I wanted to get rid of.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I had to ask...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Charon mate, now hypothetically, if I provided you with, say, a thousand coins, would you be willing to give me a ride in your beautiful boat? Upriver, I should say, specifically.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nrrnnhhh, hnnnn, hrrnn, hrrrrrnnn....",CHARACTER,Charon,male
I'll take that as a no.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Erm, Charon, mate...? I don't suppose you've given any further thought to my proposal to, just, you know... ferry me up to the surface? Seeing as it's not out of your way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Rhhuuaaauuggghhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Brilliant.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Got to say, you are a sight for sore eyes, there, Charon! So, uh... looks like you're selling, is that it? You come to help me out?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Uunngggghhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Hey good to see you out here, mate! And looks as though you've got some fine wares up for sale, don't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Urrrnngghhhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Haaahhhhhhhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Fine day to you as well, there, mate! Now let's have a look at your supply, shall we?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll just have a look around.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You must have a lot of stops around these parts, don't you, Charon mate. Most of the dead are here in Asphodel, correct?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Nnnnrrrrrhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Couldn't agree more, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Charon, I'm in Asphodel now, aren't I? I'd always heard this was some flower-covered meadow type place, not such a... terrifying hellscape.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hhhhaaaaaaahhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Charon. If there happens to be something really horrible awaiting me beyond that door there, then... give me a sign, won't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hhhaaaaaaahhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"That bad, huh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Care to provide me any insight as to just what sort of hideous monstrosity awaits me over on the next infernal island, Charon mate?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hheeehhhhhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Hah, I knew it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, look at you, Charon mate, you're looking well! Something's different about you, can't quite put my finger on it. Have you done something with your hair?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Urrraaauuhggghh...,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Well, cheers!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Charon mate, wanted to thank you once again for the fine hourglass you gave to me before! It's been very handy with those Wells of yours.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hheeehhhhhhh....,CHARACTER,Charon,male
Well that is a relief!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Charon, you're not angry with me after we had it out last time, are you, I mean... I figured since you gave me one of your Loyalty Cards, must mean everything's fine, but... I'm... just making sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Krrr, krraauuuggghhhh...!",CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Always appreciate your sense of humor, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"No hard feelings about that whole battle-to-the-death thing last time, right, Charon? Especially since you absolutely demolished me. I was just messing with you, you know that, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Nrraaauuuggghhh...!,CHARACTER,Charon,male
You don't say.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hi Charon! I finally met Hermes, god of swiftness, travel, bringing souls of the departed to your boat. Calls you his professional associate. You and he, you've been working together for a while, haven't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Hrrrrrrnnnnghhhhhhhh...,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"Err I'm sorry mate, I meant you no offense.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Charon, I always thought Olympians never consorted with chthonic gods such as yourself. But it sounds like Hermes is a close colleague of yours. You wouldn't... happen to know why he's helping me, would you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Grrrhhhoooaaaaaahhhh...!,CHARACTER,Charon,male
"I'll... keep it to myself for now, then. Thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Charon, Hermes told me that the other Olympians are unaware he's lending his support to me. I'm curious to know what's going on. Thinking of asking Nyx. Figured I'd check with you first.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

Appreciate your support!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"If it's any consolation, mate, I'm certain every single undead court musician serving in the throne room of the god of the dead has been through everything you're going through.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"It's awfully quiet here, you know, when you're out and about? Makes me a bit self-conscious, truth be told, seeing as ostensibly I'm the musician of this court.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"I, I suppose I have, yeah. But recently I found my drive again, and that's why I have to get out of here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"I fear my muse is long since lost to me, my friend, though truly thanks for asking. I suppose she must be out there somewhere still, since I once traveled 'cross this land in search of her, and found her then. But that was quite a while back.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Wait, you found her? What happened?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, this was back when I was still alive, you understand. Your father, why, he doesn't care for anyone to leave this realm, and, basically now I'm stuck here as well! Not seen her since, and, I'm not much for travel anymore.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
That's... I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. I hope you get to see her again someday.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

That's quite a few. She sounds like she was a real catch all right. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing your memory of her with me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Inspiring enough to... make you want to sing, again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, that's a rather bold insinuation, Zagreus. I don't know that I've the will for that, I... just, I need some time to think, is that all right?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"It sounds like Father's very cross with you, Orpheus. Won't you consider singing once again? You know his threat of further punishment is not a bluff.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Your father can be.... most persuasive, yes, my friend. However, this time, I am... putting my foot down! I have no plans to sing for him again.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

Well then how about for me? Or for your other friends among the court?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I... no. Please. My muse is gone to me. I can do no such thing.,CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Appreciate it, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You seem quite agitated, as of late, my friend. Is anything amiss with you, perhaps?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Oh! No, I'm all right, Orpheus. Just a lot on my mind is all, sorting out what's next. Stuff I need to work through on my own.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, well, I truly understand. I was reluctant to discuss my long-lost muse, really for quite some time. Well, if you do require some emotional support, know that I likely shall be standing over here...",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Oh, Orpheus? I heard from Hermes, messenger and god of travel, and all that? It's odd I'm giving you his message in this case, but he says hey! Admires your musical ability, as well.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that was kind of him, my friend! When I first ventured deep into this realm, whilst searching for the soul of my lost muse... after I failed utterly, it was Lord Hermes who whisked her away. It happened so fast. He did an excellent job!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I always meant to ask you, Orpheus. Where did you learn to sing like that? Was it really Apollo himself who taught you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, why, I learned from many different sources, Zagreus. That is before all of my inspiration started coming from a single source. I credit my accomplishments to her, and to Apollo, and the gods. And to considerable time spent practicing!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Almighty Nyx appears to tolerate my presence, Zagreus. For she could cast me into everlasting darkness if my song failed to be pleasing to her. She is a most-discerning listener!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Are you the one whom I should thank for this most wondrous music stand, my friend? Why, it is positively splendid, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Our renowned court musician ought to have the finest means available, I think. I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus. Though, tell me something, how can it play your music when you're not even here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend? Know only that, whenever it produces music for your listening enjoyment, that the sound you hear is coming from my soul!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Same goes for me, mate. Same goes for me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, I am quite confused, I must admit, my friend. The Queen Persephone, she is your mother, then? How is it that she came to reside, here?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Well, erm... it all started when my father saw her on Olympus, and... they fell madly in love. He swept her off her feet, and brought her here. The Olympians, they got pretty worried when they saw she was gone. But now it's OK! Everything's out in the open.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But, surely the Queen's mother on Olympus, the great goddess Demeter... surely she would quite like it if she saw her daughter still, from time to time?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Oh, that! Thing is, Mother ate some... pomegranate seeds when she was here. And we have rules about that stuff, you know! It means she cannot leave this place for very long at all. I'm sure Demeter will understand. And unfreeze everything when her daughter's around.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, yes, pomegranate seeds, of course, of course! Though, there is one more subject I don't understand, which is... how you fit into all of this. Were you not trying to escape from here?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Forget about me, Orpheus! This isn't about me, it's about Mother. What's important is she's here, where she belongs.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I see! I understand. Well, thank you, then, for clearing all that up. It is a splendid tale, I must say, and every part of it makes sense to me, at last.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is amazing, mate. So does this mean you found your muse?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh no, I never found my muse, my friend. It's just... seeing you carrying on like this time after time, I was reminded I ought to get on with my life, too, such as it is right now.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is amazing, mate. You sing quite beautifully, with or without your muse.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How kind of you. It's just... seeing you carry on like this, time after time, I was reminded that I might as well get on with my existence, too. Such as it is right now.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"How kind of you, my friend. It's just... seeing you carry on like this, time after time, I was reminded I ought to get on with my existence, too. Such as it is right now.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I became so enthralled with song once more, my friend, that I have been inspired to compose another one. For old time's sake, perhaps.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is amazing, mate. You sing quite beautifully, with or without your muse.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How kind of you, although... my voice is nothing but the crunch of gravel underfoot compared to hers, which soars as though on wings.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Say, Orpheus? I ever tell you I once single-handedly slew a multi-headed bone hydra within the magma fields of Asphodel without so much as breaking a sweat?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My, that is wonderful to hear, my friend! Another in a litany of such heroic deeds, more noble than the heroes of our verse, and even great Achilles over there!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm glad you think so, mate! These tales of my valorous accomplishments do seem to cheer you up, so, I will keep reporting back once I rack up some more.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusExpressiveEmpathy,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Orpheus? You know about the time I vanquished seven legions of Bloodless warriors with both hands tied behind my back while hopping on one foot? Lord Poseidon dared me to do it, you know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, that is a spectacularly vivid tale, Zagreus, and most deserving to be chronicled in song! Would that there were a poet here still willing to commit such deeds to verse.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Orpheus? I take it you know all about the time I burned my father's hands to a crisp the moment I was born? He grasped me by the feet, and they caught fire! And that's why he still wears those fancy rings: to cover up the hideous scar tissue.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But that is such a splendid tale, Zagreus, deserving to be sung both far and wide, until it turns into the stuff of myth, as deathless as the gods themselves! I'll gladly tell that one about!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Hey Orpheus, you've noticed the resemblance between me and Dionysus, haven't you, mate? I'll tell you a little secret but you have to promise not to tell... We're really the same god. I love a good feast, don't I?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But, Zagreus, that is a striking revelation, the connection you describe. I see it! I can see it now! To think the god of wine and you are intricately linked, it isn't obvious, is it?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Oh, there's more to it! A bit grim, really, as I'm a little older than I look. You see, the Titans, they once tore me limb from limb, but then my heart was saved, and that's where Dionysus comes from! That is the connection between us, you understand me, mate?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your tale stirs my soul, it truly does, my friend. It is a marvel to me that such heroism isn't widely known, and I'm committed to the spread of all such truths.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Orpheus, you know I've just been messing with you, with those Dionysus tales, and all that? Just trying to liven things up for us, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Zagreus! There isn't need for such humility, not when one's deeds of heroism are as great and numerous as yours! It is an honor to have heard such deeds first-hand!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, mate, sometimes I worry that you're taking my tall tales rather seriously. You're not really going about and telling everyone this stuff, are you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come now, my friend! I know this is a test of faith! Of course I am committed to the spread of such heroic deeds as yours. And I do so enjoy getting to hear them first!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Orpheus? I figure that you've heard by now about how I bested the Minotaur Asterius, alongside Theseus, the Champion of Elysium, himself? I don't think I even broke a sweat.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"I scarce can possibly imagine such a spectacle, my friend! But certainly I shall attempt to try!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Orpheus, you have to hear this straight from me. I vanquished my own father, on the outskirts of the Temple of Styx. At the surface! I know how this looks, since I'm back here, and so is he. You believe me, don't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Of course I do, my friend! Though, you must know, your father has requested his relationship to you be kept quite clandestine. You'll understand if I not sing your praises in this case, won't you?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Orpheus, sorry to interrupt, it's just... I couldn't help but notice that new ballad that you're playing, there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Technically, one ought consider it a hymn, my friend! In honor of your numerous travails, prior to your current set of circumstances, which must pale in comparison to all the rigors you've endured to date!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Erm, the thing is... none of the information in your hymn is accurate. It's nonsense. I was just kidding with you, mate! I tried to make that clear. You get so lively when I tell you my tall tales, you know? You're not angry with me, are you...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Heavens, no, my friend! Your humility is matched only by your perseverance in the face of adversity! May your great deeds live on forever, much like you!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"What? Why... yes. I know Eurydice. Or, I once knew her, I should say. Whyever would you ask me such a thing, my friend?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We more than knew each other, Zagreus. We were husband and wife. She was my muse. To think that we are doomed to be apart during our afterlives. Ah, well!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Ah, well? Don't you have a message I could bring to her, if we should meet again? Something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Say, Orpheus. You're not going to believe this. I happened on a certain nymph during my journeys recently. It was Eurydice. Tall, woodsy type?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What? Why... truly. I knew Eurydice resided in your father's realm, but... I had not anticipated you would cross her path. You're certain of this, then?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I saw her, mate. In Asphodel. She's doing fine up there! All on her own. You said the two of you were very close, isn't that right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We were much more than that, Zagreus. We were husband and wife. She was my muse. To think that we are doomed to be apart during our afterlives. Ah, well!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, it's just... I almost saved her soul from this domain, back when I lived and breathed. But in the final moments of my rescue, my faith faltered. She is lost to me forever, now. Though, I'm pleased to hear she isn't lost to you!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"Almost, my friend, almost. But in the final moments of my rescue, my faith faltered. She is lost to me forever, now. Though, I'm pleased to hear she isn't lost to you!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Pray tell me something, Zagreus. How is she lately, hm? Eurydice, I mean. Her hair, fall colors, or full bloom? Her poise, as proud and supple as the oak?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"She's all right, Orpheus. Seems comfortable within her little place in Asphodel. The only thing that seems to bother her at all is... when I mention you. Is there nothing you can do to patch things up?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Alas, I cannot change the past, my friend. So, no. As you can plainly see by now, I'm dead to her. Rightfully so, at that.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"But that's just a technicality! I mean, you're here, she's there! So what if you're not breathing anymore, you have all eternity ahead of you. Don't you want to see her again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't I want to see my Eurydice again...? Why, yes. That, more than anything, my friend. Provided she wanted to see me. I tried once to disturb her everlasting rest, as you well know. And that did not pan out as I had hoped....",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"What news of late about Eurydice, my friend? She is as delicate as I described, no doubt? Ah, but... I am dwelling on her once again, it seems.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I knew she was a talented musician, mate, but you never let on that she is an amazing chef, as well. She's been hospitable to me each time we've met. Though you still seem to be a bit of a sore subject.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How very understandable, indeed. Were I to have been failed to be rescued from the depths of hell, mere moments from escape, I too would be quite cross with my attempted rescuer. And for quite some time.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Orpheus, I don't suppose you know how come I keep running into Eurydice in particular out there? For all the shades resting eternally in Asphodel, it seems beyond coincidence I always find the one that's dear to you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have no knowledge of the weavings of the Fates, my friend. Perhaps they trample on what used to be my heart for leisure or for sport, do you suppose?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I know no other way, my friend.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Say, Orpheus, Eurydice told me your songs, some of them came from her? She seems quite brilliant. You choose your muses well!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I owe my everything to my Eurydice. She authored many of my songs, indeed; and she inspired many, many more. Whilst living, we collaborated frequently, you see.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
But weren't you the famous one? I don't understand why she doesn't share your renown.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It is but one of life's injustices, I fear. I always sang her praises every chance I had. And she asserted herself splendidly. Yet even still, our listeners believed our songs, they came from me... what else could I have done?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I don't exactly know the ways of mortals, mate. But I'm pleased to hear you always giving credit where it's due.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Then, word will spread. I'm sure of it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Orpheus, you said that it was one of life's injustices that Eurydice doesn't get her fair share of the credit for the songs she wrote. Isn't there something we can do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, I don't know, my friend. Once people set their minds to certain things... it can be difficult to show them other possibilities exist. What's to be done?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I don't know... tell them they're wrong? Politely, perhaps not? Or... tell them what's right. Get the word out about what's right? Can't we do that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Get the word out...? But I am court musician of this House. My songs no longer reach too many ears. Although... I do suppose all of these shades about... they are my audience, as well. I shall make certain that they know whose songs I sing.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I must confess something to you, my friend. My mind still wanders to Eurydice quite often, and my memories of her. Despite my best attempts to move along with my existence here. I would call it a fatal flaw, except, I am already dead.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Don't torture yourself, mate. You've been through enough. As has she! You still care for one another just don't have a way to get the point across. But I have an idea.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I, too, once had ideas, Zagreus. Ideas, and inspirations. It was so very wonderful, to have a muse...",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I got you something, Orpheus. It's a new song. From someone who still cares for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"My friend, you wrote a song, for me...? Oh, but this is not from you, it's from... Eurydice... I, no, I don't know what to say, I... I...",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"You sing beautifully, mate. If only Eurydice could hear you singing this right now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh. Thanks for the sentiment, my friend, it's just... when I sing this song of hers, why, I've this feeling where my heart once was that, well... perhaps she can.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You sing beautifully, mate. If only Eurydice could hear you singing this right now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh. Thanks for the sentiment, my friend, it's just... when I sing this song of hers, why, I've this feeling where my heart once was that, well... perhaps she can.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
Thank you. I shall. I shall!,CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Zagreus! The most amazing circumstances have occurred. The terms of my employment, they've been altered such that... I may visit Asphodel sometimes. May visit her.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"That's great! Orpheus, what are you waiting for, mate? Go and find your muse out there! You two have lots to catch up on, I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think you're right. I am so very anxious, I must say. But I must also thank you, for this opportunity, and... for speaking with me all this time. So, how might I repay you?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Why is it always talk of payment around here? You're my mate. And your songs have lifted many spirits here, including mine. Now go, and make the most of this, will you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Great to hear it. I can only imagine.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Orpheus, you're back! How was your trip? I hope it was all right.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It was more than all right, my friend. Why, it was positively inspirational. But I've returned as promised to this House. My love is there, whilst my responsibilities are here.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"You sound despondent again, mate. You must wish you were there right now. I'm sorry you had to come all the way back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, on the contrary, Zagreus. It dawned upon me that having some distance between my responsibilities and my domestic life, why... it is not so bad. Besides, Charon makes travel to and fro quite simple for me, really.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"You're doing wonderfully at it, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I have to ask you something, Orpheus. It seems like everything has been all right for you, except... you don't look very happy to me, mate. Is everything all right? Between you and Eurydice, I mean?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, haha, but your concern is much appreciated, friend. I feel I am in everlasting bliss. It simply does not show upon my countenance. Perhaps through song is how I best express myself.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, thank you also, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Orpheus. You know I'm very happy that things turned out well between you and Eurydice, but... looking back, I think I might have overstepped my bounds with you a bit, and wanted to say I'm sorry.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're sorry, Zagreus? Whatever for? If not for you, I fear I never would have seen my muse again.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Well, it's just... when I met her, and I found out the two of you were having problems, I... well, I just wanted to see you patch things up. But, it wasn't any of my business, and you never asked my help. Neither did she. I could have made things worse.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But, you didn't make things worse, my friend. And... truth be told, I do not think I ever would have asked for help, at any point, because... I don't entirely know how. So I am grateful to you, and your generous instinct.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I highly doubt it, no.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I shall give it some thought, I think.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Say, Orpheus! I heard what must have been a song of yours, it went something, something, in the blood, you know that one? It was amazing, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that one, yes, I know! I mean, it was a favorite, I was told, by those who listened to the music I created with my muse. It was a most productive time, back when we were alive!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
Would you ever sing it again?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Orpheus. The keepsake that you gave me... it's come in useful, thanks. I can't quite see what's in the container, though. I shouldn't open it, should I?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, Zagreus. Unless of course you wanted to set loose a cherished living memory of mine, and take from me that fleeting bit of joy?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Orpheus, the Distant Memory you gave me... it's a bit of your past with Eurydice in there, isn't it. I'm grateful, but... why give me such a precious gift as that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm glad you like it, Zagreus. Some memories are cherished, yes, indeed. But there can come a point where they provide more benefit to others than ourselves. Don't you agree?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Of course, my friend.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Have you considered doing music-making as a recreational pursuit, my friend? You have such slender hands, why, I believe you'd do quite well at it.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not really been at the top of my list of late, mate, but who knows. It's something I've been meaning to try at some point, I suppose. Thanks for the words of encouragement!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Orpheus! I got myself a lyre much like yours, except I'm absolutely miserable when I try to play! Got any advice?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, why, that's splendid, Zagreus. And I can certainly show you a thing or two. First, the proper posture is important, here...",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"...now remember to practice the plucking technique which I taught you, and mind your off-hand constantly. And, above all, continue practicing! The joyfulness is in the practicing itself.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Zagreus, I heard your recent lyre-playing from your bedchambers. Let no one lead you to believe it's not a reassuring start.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Oh, come now, mate, I'm terrible and you know it. You pulling one over on me as payback?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm being serious, my friend. It is a challenging pursuit requiring a dedicated state of mind. The progress shall come. You shall discover what I mean.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's almost everything to me, my friend.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
Your music-playing has improved substantially. Perhaps in time you shall surpass my own abilities!,CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I highly doubt that, mate, though thanks for noticing. Creating music's quite rewarding once you get the hang of it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I must commend you on the most splendid lyre-playing emanating from your bedchambers, my friend. It seems we have a second court musician, now.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Thank you for encouraging me to give it a shot, mate. And for the kind words.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...You called upon your humble court musician, as I understand, Lord Hades sir? Referring to myself of course?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Well, Orpheus... if you're quite finished with your little stint within the depths of Tartarus, I'd like to ask again: Play us a song, already. Or else next time I'll not be quite so charitable with your punishment.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, that. I must apologize, again, Lord Hades sir. For I'm afraid that I've no wish to sing as yet. In spite of your persuasiveness even. And, that, um, is my final word upon the subject. At this time.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Is that so...? Why, then, I'll go ahead and wait. I've all the patience in the world.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Help me to understand something here, Orpheus. Why do I bother keeping such a worthless shadow of a court musician in my House? You prattle ceaselessly, yet I can't get even a single note out of you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"If I may be so bold, my lord? Perhaps the merest sight of me still stirs in you a memory of my performances of yore. It gladdens me you used to like my songs.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Finally returned to your senses, haven't you, Orpheus. A court musician who refused to sing! Such nonsense. I trust there shall be no more insubordination from you, moving forward?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I'm gladdened that my songs yet stir your soul, my lord. But, I have to confess my choice to sing again was motivated largely by the Prince. And by my muse, of course.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
OrpheusFidget,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Still going on about your so-called muse, I see. You had your chance with Eurydice. You squandered it. And now you're here; a deal is a deal. I expect you to comply with your end of our agreement.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Nrgh...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Good thing that's settled, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I'm pleased to know my new, more flexible arrangement remains to your satisfaction, still, my lord. I must admit I feared that my departure would result once more in a protracted stay within the pits of Tartarus.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Don't give me such ideas, Orpheus! Instead, you go about your business, there, and play your blasted songs when circumstances call for it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male

"Oh, fear not, Orpheus, I was quite boastful in my day. And would you look at where it got me? Besides, I've not the imagination to come up with tales as tall as those of our Prince Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
Now that you mention it... I can't.,CHARACTER,Achilles,male
I can!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Do you miss it, yourself, Lord Achilles, sir? The freshness of the air. The need to have meals several times a day, and such.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I scarce remember it, my friend. Although your songs do stir up memories, sometimes. I'm used to things the way they are, I think. But you, not so much?",CHARACTER,Achilles,male

"I'm cheering for you all the way, my friend.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"Good luck to you out in that deadly hellscape, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"I'm kind of singing at the moment, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
Terribly sorry I can't speak with you right now.,CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I thought I'd lost even the gift of music, Zagreus. So, thanks again for helping find that one for me!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I must say, it's nice having some music in my life again, and hopefully in yours!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"We all could use a little song from time to time, isn't that so?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"It's nice that I no longer have to live and breathe, and can be focused purely on my song...!",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"You rescued me from an eternity of not getting to sing, my friend.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"It's nothing, Orpheus. Thank you for all the inspiration through your song. I love your work, mate.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You're always much too kind, you know, my friend? Now typically I would express my gratitude through song, except, you understand, don't you?",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male
"I understand completely, Orpheus. I think we'll both get through this rough patch in due time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You always offer means to quench my thirst, my friend. A wonder that I have such feelings, even now.",CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

"Got to tell you I've warmed up to this old song over the years!,",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female

This one reminds me of my days alive with my Eurydice...!,CHARACTER,Orpheus,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Tsch... why don't you raise your voice a little louder so that all the House can hear. Is that what you want? For everyone to know that you're superior to me?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female

"You're not hearing me, Meg. I know it sounds a little disingenuous considering we keep fighting to the death and all, but... I never meant to hurt you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prove yourself, to me...? You must not be as comfortable in your own skin as you let on. I can't decide if I like that about you. Now leave me alone while I give it some thought.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female

"So, Zagreus. How's it going with that Pact of Punishment you signed? You've made some meaningful improvements to the Underworld.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female

Zagreus. I heard Lord Hades served you with a Pact of Punishment. You must be very proud.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"What, you mean the gigantic infernal contract reserved only for extraordinary circumstances? Yeah, I suppose I'm pleased that Father's gone to all that trouble just for me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, when you're finished being smug about it? Know that all of us are bound by its terms. You can force a lot of things to change if you're not careful.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"A lot of things, such as how you refuse to reason with your positively charming sisters, Meg?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
The Extreme Measures condition... you wouldn't dare. Do you have any idea what you're talking about?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Yeah.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, how was it up there, Zagreus? Within Elysium. You'll have to tell us all about it every time the greatest strike you down.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You've never been there, have you? It's... lush? Is that a word? It feels closer to the surface. Closer to the sky.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How poetic. You could have visited as part of your responsibilities. Instead, you trespass. Incurring wrath of fallen champions in service of your father.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female

"So you cleared out some of the Satyr infestation near the surface, then. How come the change of heart? Not like you to assist Lord Hades in such things.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I wasn't trying to do my father any favors, Meg. Those Satyrs seem to hate me just as much as him. My one way out involves a detour straight into their dens.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"An interesting coincidence. At any rate, that's one less problem for the rest of us to deal with. Until the Satyrs all come back, at least, which won't be long.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You've been through hell more times than you can count by now, haven't you, Zag. You getting used to it? No wonder that you're friends with Sisyphus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'm getting used to it, all right. I'll keep going, for as many chances as it takes. I'll look forward to our next appointment out there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Appointment. Indeed. Don't keep me waiting. For all your toil, I'm sure you're not even close.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I will not let that happen.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

It is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What are you doing here? I heard you finally made it out. What, did you break out of here, only to die in some pathetic way on the surface?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Long story, but yeah. Boils down to what you said, more or less.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"None of my business, I said.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Meg, did you... did you ever meet the Queen...? Remember anything about her, at all?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It was not my place to address her. I barely ever saw her. Then, at some point... I never saw her again. And, unlike you, I know better than to get involved in things that are none of my business.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How is it that this place has this secret Queen for I don't know how long, then suddenly she just vanishes, and no one speaks a word of it?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I think that she can be the judge of that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How is she doing, Zagreus? The Queen, I mean. She was... I had admired her.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Mother... she's doing well, I think. She's in good spirits every time we meet. Happy to let her know you're thinking of her, by the way!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't, it's... it isn't necessary. She doesn't need you telling her about this place. Sounds to me like she is better off without.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We'll make it official, all right.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Just so I understand. Breaking through everything in your path, taking resources from your father's realm, trying to get through me... all officially part of the job description?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I guess that's right... but, before you ask, I'm not doing it for him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I didn't think you'd have it in you. To leave this place for good. But I didn't think you'd take responsibility for anything, either. Anyway... we'll just have to kill each other more officially, I guess.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Hope to find out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I never thought I'd see the Queen again. I still can't quite believe she's back... and staying? Is that really your doing?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It's her doing, not mine. So you know her? Because... you could have told me. About her. Who she was to me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't know her all that well. But I do know Nyx, and I've been bound to secrecy as part of my oath to this House. I flay oathbreakers and liars, Zagreus. Wouldn't do for me to be no better than them, now, would it?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, I suppose not. So what does this mean for Nyx, now that she's back? Or for you, for that matter?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The Queen always gave Nyx her space. Your father, though... I don't know what it'll be like for him, if she decides to stick around this time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Exactly!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So the Olympians are backing you officially now? Doing their part to help the family business, finally. Lord Hades probably never thought he'd see the day. Night? You know what I mean.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Seems only fair they should help in some capacity. They all work together on the surface, and, let's face it, they're responsible for a good number of shades pouring into this realm. Least they can do is help shore up the whole 'there is no escape' reputation we've got.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
By making you unfairly stronger by the time you try to get through me?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Heh. Guess you'll find out.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Heh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, Zag? You like things nice and complicated, don't you. Apparently so do I.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"If you're asking if I have any regrets about what happened between us, the answer is no. Being with you... any complications there are worth it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You don't need to tell me. Two rules, if you want to keep this up. First... we set the personal aside when we're out there. I better not hear a soul say I'm going soft on you. And second... keep up this slightly more mature thing you've had going for you recently.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wasn't planning on sliding back into the insensitive nonsense of youth, so I don't think the second thing will be a problem. But the first... can we really just keep killing each other out there like nothing happened?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thanks, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tsk... Come off it, Zag. Are you really going to act all uncomfortable every time you see me now? More than usual I mean.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"No, it's just... I felt terrible, turning you away. It's just... I've been so confused lately, and... I trust you. You're someone I can talk to. I guess I'm... afraid to lose that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't be an idiot, and you won't. We've been through a lot together. Grown, maybe. This particular relationship... it can't die so easily, I think.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I refuse.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I feel like everybody knows about us, Meg. Even Aphrodite, herself, seemed to know we were involved. It's not like I've been going around boasting. You wanted to keep things quiet, didn't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Zagreus. Are you happy with how things are between us now? Or do you have a problem with it?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well, I could do without the kill-or-be-killed stuff if we're being honest, that part is still a little weird, but otherwise... yes, I mean... I'm happy. You're you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then, that's enough. Let them say what they want. What does it matter? We're gods. The things they say about us... even other gods... you pay too much attention to it, it'll drive you out of your mind.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
But... I know how important your career is to you. This won't create a problem?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We've already crossed that bridge, I think. Stop worrying.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Heh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Megaera... you ever been in love with somebody?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Hm. Yes.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Who?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Shut up.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well, thanks. I guess I am.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Never in my wildest fantasies did I imagine you'd ever end up on the Featured Houseservant Board, Zagreus. I still can't entirely believe it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Whoa, back up! Can you elaborate a bit about these wildest fantasies, Meg?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm serious. You should be proud. Not arrogantly proud to a fatal fault or anything, but a little bit is all right in a case like this.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll keep putting up a fight if it's any consolation.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Got to tell you something, Zagreus. I'm not getting any more used to losing to you like this. I mean... you don't even stop to rub it in. You know how humiliating that is?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wait, you're saying you would feel less ashamed about the outcomes of our fights if I were to gloat more about beating you? How does that make any sense?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You know what doesn't make any sense? That you keep beating me. I must be getting sloppy if I'm that predictable... too bad none of the other wretches I have to deal with put up much of a fight.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_ReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You and your sisters really don't get along well, do you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusExpressiveEmpathy,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Alecto and Tisiphone and I each have a different outlook, I would say. We've learned mostly to stay out of one another's way.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That doesn't sound like a healthy basis for a relationship between siblings.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Are you lecturing me about healthy relationships with family, Zagreus? Your family, your father's family, is the most broken and corrupted in the history of the entire concept.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Fair point. I... didn't mean to sound like I had any meaningful advice, there, Meg. We're stuck with our bloodlines and our relatives, aren't we.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Your family cut their Titan parents into pieces and then scattered them in Tartarus. Remember that when next you tell me about family.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_ReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, while it was brutal squaring off against the three of you, I have to say, Meg... I was happy you were with your sisters. Nothing like a common cause for bringing bitter rivals together, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You have your Pact of Punishment to thank for our reunion, there. We have to answer to its terms. But my sisters and I, we got on better than I had expected, I will give you that.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"So you've patched things up, then? Going to start spending more quality time together and all that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hm, let's not get carried away. A work assignment forcing our cooperation is not exactly a big step in the quality of our relationship.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Alecto's really something else. She must have been a real handful, huh?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My youngest sister takes a lot of pleasure from her work. I've learned something of that from her. But that's as far as we relate, I think.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"She could learn a thing or two from you, I'm sure. About having a little common decency, perhaps.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
She won't be learning anything from me. The contempt you get from her is unconditional. I learned not to take it personally.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Erm, so, about Tisiphone, is... uh... everything all right with her? Talk of murder, all the time, and all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Tisiphone is charged with punishing the worst that mortals have to offer. More than charged. Her work is everything to her.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"No time for family or recreation, then, I take it? Pity what happens to those overly obsessed with work.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I get what you're insinuating, Zagreus. I'm nothing like her. Not even close. And don't you dare compare the two of us again.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You know, that's a good way to put it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"So you've been trying to give Tisiphone speech lessons between fights to the death. Are you bored, or just naive?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Come on, if her vocabulary consists of two different although admittedly almost identical words, there's got to be room for growth, there. Besides, I feel like... maybe she's lonely, or something. Has anyone ever tried to teach her anything?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Maybe, just maybe, you're projecting your own insecurities onto her a little bit? Tis can take care of herself. Always has. Talking's not her strong suit like it's yours. But if you, in all your wisdom, think you've got something to teach her, you go right ahead.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You've tried already, haven't you? She's pretty dead-set on the murder thing, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You'd think!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You and Thanatos don't work together much anymore, do you, Meg?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
No. Though he still brings me my assignments every now and then.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oathbreakers, traitors, and the like? Sending them straight to Tartarus, huh. Must be quite an experience going from living and breathing, to... being dead, to being whisked off by Thanatos, straight to you and your whip.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If that's not the experience mortals are looking for, they need only keep their oaths and not betray the ones they're closest to. It's not that hard.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Have you tried sulking in the lounge?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hmm.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're not too broken up about how things ended between you and Hypnos, are you, Meg?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm still in a state of shock. I'll have to pick up the pieces somehow, and figure out how to get on with my existence.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
It's a change.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You got that court musician to pipe up again. I know you can't shut up, but didn't know it was contagious.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Hey, it was all Orpheus, not me. Can't sing like that without a lot of motivation, inner turmoil, who knows what else. Why, don't you like it? This lounge seems better with a little song.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
This lounge is fine. And the singing... not used to it yet.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You always do.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Not seen the court musician sulking over there quite as much lately. Your doing, I hear?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You'll just have to sulk for the both of you, I guess, then, Meg. But if you must know, on my authority I have released Orpheus from the terms of his old, rather unfair agreement with Father, so he can see his wife at least from time to time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
And Lord Hades is OK with you just picking out old binding contracts and nullifying them? You're exploiting your status.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'm doing no such thing. Father wanted me involved in all this business with his pacts, and presiding over the dead, then fine. But I'll do it my way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hoh now let's not get ahead of ourselves, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"What do you think of all the lounge decor, there, Meg? Looking a little better these days, wouldn't you say?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, it isn't bad. Though I have heard the strangest thing, that you're responsible, for all of this? I couldn't understand why you would even bother, honestly.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well, it's a popular locale for off-duty Underworld officers to take a load off between shifts, and so I figure... least I can do is pitch in and make the place a little better than I left it, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How very selfless of you, Zagreus. Soon doubtless it'll be your portrait hanging on that wall back there.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Good!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The prism-sphere in the corner is maybe a little much. But the fireplace... the bat-cage... the aquarium... this lounge is practically comfortable. Lord Hades would strongly disapprove.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Good thing he never sets foot in here, then, huh? Wait, you don't miss when things were all sad and dreary in here, do you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm still getting used to it. But, no.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
That she is.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How's my little Battie doing, Zag? The one I gave you. Was just a little pup. I figured she'd be better off with you. Please tell me I was right.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Battie's doing great, Meg. Reminds me of you every time I think of her. Helps keep me company throughout my little jaunts outside. So you've a thing for bats, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's good. And yes, the bats around here, they and I have always shared an understanding, you could say. I usually care for the pups myself. But Battie? She seemed more your style.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
How is this my fault?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Meg, what's going on with Nyx and Dusa, do you know? I think they've been butting heads a bit lately.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can't imagine why. Nyx has her under strict orders, yet you keep on stopping by for your little chats. You think she doesn't notice?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What does she care? I talk to everybody around here at least a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's not my business, Zag. Not even for Dusa. But you watch yourself.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_ReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Nrgh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Damn you, Zagreus. She was my friend. And now she's gone.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Who, you mean Dusa? Like I had anything to do with that. It's Nyx you should be cross with, not me!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't think so. Nyx warned you. Ungh, you know I can't go to her myself about this, so fix it!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_ReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This never should have happened, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You saw Dusa's back, right, Meg? She's getting another chance. Nyx reconsidered!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I saw. Nyx doesn't often change her mind when it comes to this House. But I won't second guess what happened or why.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You don't sound all that pleased...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Of course.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm so proud of Dusa lately, Meg! Chief Custodian of the House, was it? That's quite an honor coming from Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I thought all the added responsibility would stress Dusa out worse than usual. But she's taking it in stride.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You're always looking out for her. Thanks for that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not doing it for you. Though... thanks for looking out for her, yourself.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Appreciate your open-mindedness.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I did not appreciate you sending Dusa after me out there, Zag. You leave her out of this! Though... it was good to see her out of this damned House for a change.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"See, I, too, thought she could use the fresh air. Or... however you'd describe the quality of the air on the edge of Tartarus. You know she'd never mean you any harm, right? In her mind... I think she's trying to keep it friendly between us.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Eugh, she said the same thing to me. Look, you know what, fine. If that's the only way to get her to take a break from this place, I guess it's for the best.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_ReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Meg, I understand you're under orders to kill me on sight out there, but... do you really have to go so hard on Sisyphus?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That wretched shade isn't who you think he is. Do you have any idea of the magnitude of his crimes from when he led a mortal life?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"He cheated death. Tricked Thanatos and maybe Father, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Before that, he did worse. He was an awful man. I think that is the real reason that your father punished him.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What if he's changed? Or... is that impossible. No coming back from certain crimes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No coming back from certain crimes, indeed. Though you may have more mercy in your heart to spare than I in mine.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
It's a deal.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I have to ask you for a favor, Meg. And I'm willing to make it worth your while, if you'll hear me out.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A proposition, Zagreus? Let's hear it, then. While I'm in a charitable mood.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It's about Sisyphus. If I can get my father to alleviate his sentence, would you just... ease off of him, a little bit? You and your sisters. I think he's suffered quite enough under your whips.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know what you see in him, I swear. But you don't need to ask such things of me. If you can overturn his sentence with Lord Hades, I'd like nothing better than to never see that miserable shade again.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
...I... I think so.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Megaera, I have to ask you something, please. We really need to talk.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...For once, I think you're right. Although, I'm curious, what is it that you think we have to talk about?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I still have feelings for you. At least... I think I do. Isn't there... isn't there someway for us to, you know... work through all of this?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"In spite of everything that's happened, and that's happening right now? What are the outcomes, Zagreus? Either you eventually succeed, and leave this place, or else, what, exactly?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I haven't thought that far ahead. But I don't think it has to be this way. I don't hate you, Meg. I don't think I can ever hate you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Despite my best intentions. Unfortunately, I don't know that I can say the same. Look, I'm at a very difficult point in my career. I need to focus on that now. Do we understand each other?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female

"I will. Thanks, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Meg, you know what's going on with Than and me, don't you? I just... want things to be out in the open, between us.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I know everything about you, Zag. And Thanatos, maybe even better. Though I appreciate you telling me. It's fine.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It's fine? I mean... upon Olympus, jealousy runs rampant, as I'm told. But here it's not even an issue, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you prefer the way they do things on Olympus, then I think you know the way. As for me... dealing with jealousy is what I do. Tell me, should I feel threatened by Thanatos?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"No... he thinks so highly of you, he... he'd never wish to cause you any harm.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And I feel much the same. He and I, we're not the same to you. I think we both see that, and understand. Now quit your second-guessing me, all right?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...Make certain of it, Megaera. I am finding, lately, that the help within this House is much more lacking than it used to be. I trust that you shall set it back on course.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...If that is your will, Lord Hades, then it will be done. To the fullest limits of my capability.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Scoff>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...Give me another chance, Lord Hades. I can do better. Don't... bring them here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It is already too late for that, Megaera. They have been notified and are en route to Tartarus even as we speak.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You know what they're like. They are best left to their specific tasks. Not this.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Megaera, trust me when I say I know the feeling all too well. However, surely, in your ingenuity, you may yet find a way to get your sisters to see eye to eye.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...I cannot work with them, Lord Hades. Please. They don't respect my words, or even listen.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Enough! Besides, Megaera, this is not your failing. It is mine. I must attend to these affairs more actively.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...I've often tried, but never to a satisfactory result. You're asking the impossible of me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I am not asking, Megaera.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...But, I don't understand, Lord Hades. I have fallen to him countless times. How can this be...?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You and your sisters have protected Tartarus unerringly. The Prince has proven uncontainable. The fault is mine, not yours. Your duty to this realm must be commended.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You honor me... I have done nothing to deserve this. There must be something more that I can do?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"There is, and isn't, Megaera. I ask only that you remain committed to this realm. Bar passage in and out of Tartarus. And, if the Prince continues to show up... you give him hell.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Lord Hades, it will be my pleasure, sir.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...We each have our commitments to this House, Megaera. There is no shame in yours. And whilst your sisters are away, you bear their burden of responsibility, as well.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I understand, it's just... am I supposed to keep pretending nothing's changed? This House is cracking at the seams, and no one's going to admit it?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The House shall stand eternally, although in what condition, it is ours to decide. Our obligation is to keep the House in order.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I know. You're right of course, you're right... I'll do my best. I'll do my best for both our sakes, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
...We all do that which is within our power.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
...Not my business.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...and so, who else is there to be depended on...? You are a trusted overseer, Megaera. Your station is no accident and there is no one better fit for what you do. I urge you to look inwardly. How you approach your work is vital to the end result.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Thank you for the advice, Nyx. I don't know what I'd do without you. Or what this House would be if not for you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Scoff>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...But, how can you do this to me? Blast your Mirror. By taking sides with him, you're standing against me...!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Neutrality ceases to be an option when a crisis rises to a certain point, Megaera. You, yourself, shall have to choose allegiances. I have steadfastly told you this throughout our shared ordeal.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I thought that both of our allegiances were to this House, Nyx. It seems I was mistaken. Do you have any idea what sort of pressure I am under here...?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Use caution with the tone you take with me, Overseer. I am the mother of the Fates, themselves. I do not act by whim or by mistake. Mind your own station, and perform your role. All shall unfold eventually as it must. I like the intervening time no more than you.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
Mmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...Nyx, you'd tell me if I made a terrible mistake, or even just a bad one, wouldn't you? I need your guidance on this one, or maybe your approval.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You shall always be the best determiner of what is right about such matters, Megaera. Though, if you seek my blessings or encouragement in this particular pursuit, please rest assured... you have them both. You know the way, from here.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I hope that you are right. You always have been, it's just that... I wish I had your confidence in this.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I do know where to find you, Megaera.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...I think I understand, now, Nyx. You've been here longer than the rest of us combined. You've seen this House go through a lot. Even before Lord Hades took his place. I never should have doubted you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"To doubt is an important instinct, Megaera. Without it, we could not conceive of better circumstances than the ones we know. Besides... I am the Night. Others shall always doubt me. You may doubt me again. I ask only that you heed well your intuitions, from now on.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I will. I promise, Nyx. And if there's anything you ever need that I can do, well... please, just ask of me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I understand.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...They can't be reasoned with, Nyx. You know that. What use are they to us, trying to manage this? They'll make things worse.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They are your sisters. They are part of your life, whether you like it or not. Your relationship with them is yours to mold.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
I'm afraid there isn't much for me to work with. You have a lot more faith in them than I do.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I have a lot more faith in you, Megaera. There are many obstinate personalities with whom we regularly interact. Thus, we do what is possible.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Would you look at that, Hypnos. Care to repeat to me the unsolicited advice you just now offered, now that Zagreus is here?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh, hahaha, well, it is my custom to give pointers to our visitors, who come involuntarily, because, I do pick up a lot of bits and pieces, talking here to everyone! About, you know... dying?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Zagreus. He told me that I ought to evade more of your attacks next time. So you just watch your back out there, because I know your secrets thanks to Hypnos here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I'll give it a shot!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
...Alas.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I think that I can find the lounge well on my own, Hypnos. Or... wait... what is this, did you just ask me out?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Me? No, nonononono, no! I'd never even think to do that, Miss, I mean, you have your station, and I have mine. We're from two different worlds, you could say. Fated never to be seen together much.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Every time I talk to you, you somehow take it as a compliment, is that correct? Then, let me give you some advice, for once. Stop being an idiot.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Will do!,CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"...You haven't greeted me as often lately, Hypnos. I wouldn't have noticed if it weren't half your job. If there's something you wish to say to me, why not just come right out.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, um, well, I, see, the thing is, Megaera, Miss Megaera, mind if I call you that? As I was saying, I just, thought maybe, you know, we had a thing, a real connection, lately, since you keep on dying more and more, and I keep standing here? But then... I always thought you were invincible...",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I see. And so you're realizing now that your entire image of me came from your imagination, is that it?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well, it's just! I really thought with all my advice that you'd go back to killing Zagreus, rather than the other way around! I just don't think things are working out the way I hoped, you know?",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
"It almost sounds as though you've broken up with me, except... well, are you sure that you'll be all right?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, yeah! Look, I'm just glad it's one of you two, sure beats having to greet shades nonstop! They never talk to me.",CHARACTER,Hypnos,male
HypnosIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All right, then... you greet me next I'm here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Heh. As you say.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"...It was my duty to prevent him from getting farther. If I succeeded... he never would have found you. So this once, I'm glad I failed. I hope you know that, my Queen.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I hoped, but did not know for certain till I heard from you just now, Overseer Megaera! And, if I may? I understand you have achieved an awful lot since I took my, erm, leave of absence from this House. I see why Nyx and Hades put their trust in you!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thank you, my Queen. Then, if there's anything else that I can do to help you reacclimate yourself, I'm always at your service. You are most welcome, here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Likewise, you be sure to let me know if my son there happens to make more trouble for you than you welcome in your life. All right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Can't you see I'm busy now with more important things than you?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"May I help you somehow, Zagreus? Because if not, why don't you leave me be.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"May I help you somehow, Zagreus, because if not, why don't you leave me be?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Do I look like I'm in the mood to chat?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Do I look like I'm in the mood to chat?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You've come to gloat, I guess? Too bad I can't just kill you where you stand, within this blasted House.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Have I somehow created the impression that I wish to speak with you? Because if so, there's been a terrible mistake.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"There must be someone else whose time you could be wasting, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It's embarrassing enough having returned here, much less to be seen talking to you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Sooner or later when we meet out there again, I'll kill you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"If I have something I decide I wish to tell you, Zagreus, I'll make it clear. Leave me alone.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your father's absolutely right about you, Zag. You are and always will be an insufferable brat.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Don't test me any further, Zagreus. You know the rules, no violence in the House.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Blood and darkness, leave me be, damn you. I've better things to do than occupy your time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I have to hand it to you, Zag. You've gotten strong. Sending me all the way back here like this.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Nyx must be worried, seeing us like this. Lately always at each other's throats.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Oh don't worry, I'll be back in fighting shape in no time, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Your father's not been very pleased with my performance lately as you might have guessed.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Sometimes, Zagreus, I'm almost not detested by the sight and smell of you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I shouldn't be back here right now. No thanks to you, of course.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I'm keeping careful track of all the times you've sent me home like this.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
At least the House seems well enough in order since I saw it last.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"We keep on running into one another lately, don't we Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You got me fair and square last time. Though I'm a little bitter anyway.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You know we can't be seen together like this, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I should be whipping Sisyphus' lazy hide right now instead of standing here.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't like having to come back here quite this often, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I'm not even remotely interested in chatting with you, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Why don't you go get out of here if you despise this place so much?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Don't you so much as dare talk to me.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Get out of my sight, Zagreus. And be thankful violence is prohibited in here.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Right now I wouldn't talk to me if I were you.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I think you'd best be on your way right now, you understand me, Zagreus?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I think you've wasted quite enough of both our time, don't you?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Whatever's on your mind, believe me, it's the last thing that I want to hear right now.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I can't believe you got me like that, Zag. I'm going to get you back.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Just here licking my wounds until we meet again out there.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Heard you made it pretty far last time.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You almost got there last time, didn't you.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Heard you made it all the way last time.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're back. Got all the way to the surface back there, huh?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Keep letting down my guard against you, Zag.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Went all the way to the top last time, huh? Not bad at all.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ugh, I don't remember the last time I beat you, Zag...",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Break's just about over. See you out there?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Hypnos give you any good pointers lately?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Taking a break from putting up with Alecto out there...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Got to say, I like what you and Dusa did with this place.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Didn't rough you up too bad last time, did I?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
You showed Alecto again. She must be so mad.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
About ready to go another round with me out there?,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I have to speak with you in private, Zagreus. Urgently.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's fortunate that matter is resolved. I'll see you out there, then.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Let's go someplace a little quieter than this. Where we can concentrate.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A little peace and quiet's good from time to time, don't you agree?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't even say a word, and follow me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Zagreus? Take care until we meet again, I guess.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Zagreus, did you forget about our private tutoring, again? Come on.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There. I take it you'll remember what I've taught you, hm?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Come with me, Zagreus. Your chambers are past due for a routine inspection.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Well! Seems everything's in order. Carry on.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If you're available right now, I have some parchmentwork that needs review.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hmm. Less parchmentwork than I expected. Well, thank you for your time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, uh, Meg? Look, I know you're just doing your job out there, and, anyway, found this, thought of you and all that, so... here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I... I'll see to it this contraband is put away at once. Now, take your finder's fee and go about your business.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Meg! I, uh, thought I'd better hand this over.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll confiscate that if you really want. Although, I'm warning you, I'm not susceptible to bribes. Many have tried.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey I'm just handing over contraband to the appropriate authorities, think nothing of it, Meg. Just doing our jobs, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tsch. You're serious. You're really giving that to me. I mean, I'll take it off your hands if that is really what you want.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"It's really what I want. And, I sincerely hope we can move past our differences. Not that turning in this contraband has anything to do with that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...I hope you do.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Such gifts won't stay my whip when next we meet out there, you realize that, right?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I realize it. And I hope you never change, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Flattery won't get you anywhere. We can't go back to how things used to be.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Flattery never got me anywhere with you to begin with, Meg. Doesn't mean I won't keep trying. I am ever stubborn, aren't I.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Got you some more of that contraband you like. Don't suppose I could help you put it away or anything...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look at me, Zag.... You think that all these gifts will make things go back to the way they were? They won't. It isn't possible. We may be immortals but we're older now.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'd hope we're wiser, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ambrosia... you know the penalty for attempting to sway an Overseer of the House of Hades with foreign contraband, don't you?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_Start,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I can't entirely say I do, though if it involves lashings and whatnot, I already get more than my share of that, so... figured I would take the risk. So what do you say?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I say hand over the damn bottle. I'll see that it's disposed of properly. Now as for you... you wouldn't know who misplaced something like this, would you? On my authority as Overseer... hang onto it. Though if you tell so much as anyone...!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetWhipTaunt_ReturnToIdle,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Uh, yeah. Bye...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I had this awful contraband I wanted to turn in as soon as possible, if you don't mind taking it from me, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch... you still have no idea how to be up front with me, do you, Zag. Why don't you tell me why you're here, and what you want.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Erm... so the whole contraband thing, you aren't buying it, I guess? Although I see you took the bottle there, now, anyway... I wanted just to talk to you. And patch things up, maybe.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Patch things up. What is it, by your estimation, that could use repairs, between the two of us, hm?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"I... I was naive. I tried not to get too close, but then I did, and said a lot of stupid things, and then... well, we've since tried to kill each other lots of times, there's that. Look, I am sorry, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You said a lot of stupid things, all right. And we Furies, we're not much for forgiveness or apologies. But... I can see you're making an attempt. Now, thank you for the contraband. Good-bye.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
I see. Take all the time you need.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Here, Meg. Contraband. I wish I could do over how we started.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I, too, wish for a lot of things. Unfortunately there's no unraveling the Fates' patterns. We can learn from our mistakes or keep repeating them. That's it.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
What if I've learned from my mistakes? Have I ever done anything to hurt you since we've been like this? Discounting the unavoidable and frequent fights to the death.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There's nothing you can do to hurt me, Zag. It's just a question of whether you're worth my time.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Well... am I worth your time, then, Meg?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You know... let me get back to you on that. I need a little time to think it through.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Yeah. Thanks.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey Meg, you're off duty, aren't you? Look, I was just... hoping you might want to split this with me, best stuff I could find out there, and I would give it all to you, it's just... maybe you wouldn't mind some company. From me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You sound a little tongue-tied, Zagreus. Just like you always used to around me.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You're not exactly easy to approach, you know. So... how about it, then? Care for a drink with me?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Open it up, and we can go from there.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
intermission,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"And I think, deep down, you are not the heartless harbinger of retribution that you want for everyone to think you are. But I can keep your secret if you're willing to keep mine, what do you say?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsch... that sounds an awful lot like blackmail, Zagreus. You'd stoop to that, with me?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"No, I... I was just, that's not what I meant at all...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahaha, I just want to see you squirm. Thanks for the company and for the drink. Guess I'll be seeing you around.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Thought I'd find Meg here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Megaera's not around.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Meg must've gone back already.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What... wow... I'll cherish her.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I, uh, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...Nyx, you'd tell me if I made a terrible mistake, or even just a bad one, wouldn't you? I need your guidance on this one, or maybe your approval.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"You shall always be the best determiner of what is right about such matters, Megaera. Though, if you seek my blessings or encouragement in this particular pursuit, please rest assured... you have them both. You know the way, from here.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"I hope that you are right. You always have been, it's just that... I wish I had your confidence in this.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
FuryIdleInHouseFidgetGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Prince Z. Must look like I'm slacking off with the old boulder, here, but... I was just getting back on my feet. The Fury Sisters don't often leave me be. Where'd they go, anyway? And... what are you doing here?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you know, just out on a little stroll is all. Do me a favor, though, you see the Fury Sisters, let them know I was headed down the way I came from, will you...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I'll let them know, all right, I hear you loud and clear, Your Highness. I'll just go about my business now, and you take care.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You know, Prince Z., I'd not expected to run into you again, not after all this time. Something amiss down in the House, or what? Not had much company of late, is all.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Oh, something's just about always amiss back home, sir. Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus a bit more frequently.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well I am grateful for it, I and the old boulder there, in turn. I'm used to going lengthy stretches on my own, but having visitors from time to time would do me well!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If I may be so bold, Your Highness, I was wondering... what brings you back around this way again? Same story as last time?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus. I'm leaving the House. I've had quite enough. You understand, I'm sure. I'm going to the surface.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Whew, that is quite an undertaking, Prince. If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told. Though you're just mad enough to pull it off! Well hey, I hope you make it. Good fortune out there!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Prince how goes the old escape plan, any luck?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You know it's been all right, all things considered. Dying now and then, and it's been hard, but hey, what can you do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, well, keep your chin up. Me, why I quit trying to get out of here a while back, but, if I was a fire-stepping youngster like yourself, perhaps I would have stuck to it.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Hey, Your Highness, anything the matter, or just passing through? Happy that we get to chat like this of late, of course.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, don't take this the wrong way, but... why are you helping me? My father's stuck you here for an eternity of torment and even still, you greet me with a smile, time after time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah! Come now, Prince Z., that's just the way I am! Besides, you're not your father, thank the gods! You always seemed a decent lad to me, and if you're saying you want out of here, why, I suppose I can relate, is all.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You know, Prince, it's been good not having to see those Fury Sisters quite as much lately. The main one, what's her name, she's on your case now, isn't she.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You mean Megaera. She's on my case all right. Under strict orders not to let me out of Tartarus. I guess that means you've got yourself a break! About damn time they gave one to you, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, quick question, Sisyphus, you seen the other Fury Sisters lately?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not seen the other Fury Sisters in some time now that you mention it! Just Megaera, the kindly one, and she is quite a handful on her own. I'll keep an eye out for the other two!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, how can you stand it, being here like this? You always seem in such good spirits, though.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You push old Bouldy here sufficient times, and you might get a different outlook on things, too. With the Furies all preoccupied and with my running into you from time to time, I'm positively doing great lately. I like to take what pleasures I can get!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look here, Bouldy, Prince Z. himself has come to visit us!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Does Bouldy really keep you company? Personally I would resent a giant boulder that keeps tumbling back down a hill after I push it all the way up there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Bouldy's not so bad, I mean, he's a good listener, a good shoulder to lean on, doesn't wield a whip... I rightly can't complain! Good having company down here.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know I was just thinking, sir... sometimes I am a little envious of you and Bouldy there. You seem to have things pretty figured out. I still grow frustrated with myself quite often and don't always know whom to turn to.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, hah! Well, I just think you're in a tough spot lately, Prince. But you'll get through! As for old Bouldy, why, by all means do not hesitate to lay your troubles on him if you like! Dumped all of mine on him a while back.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So I can just... walk up and talk to him, and chat? That's all it takes?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's truly all it takes to make a friend sometimes, indeed, Highness. Now, here.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I have to thank you, Sisyphus, not just for all the help you've given me time after time, but for encouraging me to have a chat with Bouldy there. I daresay I feel a little more at peace of late, and maybe it's thanks to him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He's a good one, all right, isn't he? Though if you've come to such an understanding with old Bouldy there, why, it must mean you've done some growing on your own as well, I think.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Your Highness, good, old Bouldy there had several things he wanted to tell you.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
.   .   .   .,CHARACTER,Bouldy,male
"Thank you for listening to him! With all that said, I think I've got something for you right here.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Prince, ah, so... you do know Bouldy's just a plain old rock with a few lines chiseled into him, resembling a face, don't you? Chiseled into it, I mean. Just so you don't get the wrong idea...",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
.   .   .   .,CHARACTER,Bouldy,male
"Come now, sir, we both know full well Bouldy's much more than that. You really think I doubt the power of Bouldy after everything we've been through?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahahaha, no. Was just a jest, there, at Bouldy's expense. Look at him! He gets so annoyed when I call him a plain old rock like that. But then he calls me an old lazy lump, and then we're even for a while.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You ever meet Alecto, Sisyphus? The Fury Megaera's nastier sister. We recently became acquainted, she and I.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, fortunately I've not seen too much of her, myself, Prince Z. And based on everything that I have seen and heard, I'd like to keep it that way for a while! I hope she doesn't cause you too much trouble there.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Sisyphus, have you had run-ins with Tisiphone the Fury here before? She isn't much for conversation, I don't think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tisiphone. Why, yes, I have, in fact, Prince Z. She's visited on multiple occasions, truth be told. So she is back, is she?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She is. Although, I think she's back to deal with me. I'll have to keep her plenty busy just in case.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Appreciate it, Prince. Of all the Fury Sisters, she's the one I would least care to see. But if she does stop by, you know, that's how it goes.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Look, Prince, I don't hold grudges, you know that. Push this boulder long as I have, you move past the petty stuff. So, just want you to know, in case you make it out this time, it's been a real pleasure.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Feeling's mutual, sir. Someday you'll have to tell me all about how you tricked Father. I might learn a thing or two.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"RequiredRunsCleared  0,",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, you ever lose somebody dear to you? There's someone out there whom I need to find. That's... all that I can say right now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I get it, Highness, and I didn't mean to pry, it's just... I can't remember what it's like to want something so bad, you know? Whoever's out there, I hope you find them soon.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Hey sir, I've always wondered, what were you like back when you were alive? Were you always this wise?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Might surprise you, Highness, I've a bit of royalty in me, myself. Not on your level, mind, but I was very much a king. Though I'll be honest, I... I wasn't much of a good man.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh! I thought I sensed the royalty in you! Although, I can't imagine you as anything besides the gentleman I know you for, my friend.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well that is awful kind of you to say. Though, I would like to think my punishment here wasn't without warrant. At least I've had a lot of time to think it through!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Erm, Sisyphus, you mind my asking what you did to warrant this particular arrangement you've got here? Pushing a boulder till the end of time and all. Never heard it in your own words.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, it's a bit of a long story, Prince. My time had come, though I just wasn't ready, you might say. Your father thought he had me in his clutches, but then, shoom! I gave him the slip. Your father's henchman, Thanatos, he'll back me up on that.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Outsmarted Thanatos, that's amazing... what happened then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Turns out your father doesn't like us mortals cheating death. Eventually they found me, so, now I'm stuck here with my boulder friend. I push old Bouldy up the hill to the beat of the Furies' whips, then he tumbles down, and then we go again.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So then, you're stuck forever, no reprieve. That's terrible... wish there was something I could do to help.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You save those sympathies for someone else, Your Highness! I could be Prometheus, spending an eternity having my liver gobbled up, but instead I get to stay in shape, and have these chats with you. Now I'd better get back to it!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Sisyphus, I've meant to ask, where are you getting all this stuff you give to me? You must be pretty well connected around here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, well, you know! I have acquaintances amongst the locals here, try to be neighborly with everyone is all. It's not just Bouldy and myself as you can see. Sometimes I come across things that'd be better off in other hands than mine.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have to tell you, Sisyphus. Sometimes I wish I knew more about your past. You must have been a great king.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, ah-hah, the thing is that I wasn't, Highness. And that's not modesty from me, all right? All behind me, now. And I'd appreciate it if we left it at that.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I hear you, sir. Though, whatever you did in your mortal days... you've since more than paid for it, I'm sure.... Wait, is that why you're still here, in Tartarus? Because you think you deserve this?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's more like... this is where I belong. Where my path has taken me, you know? Here in the Underworld, you can't entirely escape your past... and yet, it's like you get another life to live. With all the wisdom that you picked up along the way.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You know, Prince Z., you really have a look about you that you know exactly where you're going, as of late. I used to think you weren't near as comfortable in your own skin.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you were right. I was never comfortable performing Father's routine Tartarus inspections. Though those responsibilities of mine didn't last long.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nor did we have much opportunity to chat back then, but hey! You always struck me as a decent sort. Wasn't accustomed to your father's henchpeople greeting me with a smile.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Sisyphus, I know you tend to be in remarkably good spirits, all things considered, but there must be something I can do to help with your predicament, isn't there?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, come now, Prince, do Bouldy and I look like we could use your charity? We're planning to stay put within this chamber for a while. It's hardly a predicament, I'd say.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"But, what of the Furies and their torments and all that? They might be back and make all this more difficult for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ah, yes, the Fury Sisters, well. I wouldn't mind seeing them more infrequently now that you mention it, but either way! So don't you even worry about me. Now, here.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have good news, sir! I located the contract binding you, and bought it out. It's null and void. You're free to go!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Indeed, then, does this mean, Prince, then... the Fury Sisters, they won't come around as often anymore?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not just that, Sisyphus! You can make your way someplace else, where other decent shades reside! You know, somewhere with fewer chains and torture devices and such?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're much too kind to this old soul, Prince Z. The thing is, this is home. For me and Bouldy, it is what it is. Though, knowing that the Furies won't be visiting with quite their former regularity, that is a load off. Heavier than Bouldy, there.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You mean you're really going to stay? Even though you don't have to?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Is that so odd, Highness? Don't see myself lugging old Bouldy out of here, besides! And if I were to leave, why, we would not be having these exchanges now and then. I happen to enjoy them quite a bit! Now, here you go, and thank you, very much.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Must say, Prince Z., the free life sure does have its perks down here! This place really isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Glad to hear it, sir. But you're still here... the same as ever. Is it really all that different from the way it always was?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, it used to be I'd have to start heaving Bouldy there at any point, if the Fury Sisters decided to show up. But now? I just get to relax, chat a bit with the other shades, and give you one of these when you're in the area!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, there you are, Prince! I was just thinking about how grateful I am that you got me out of that contract with your father. It's been a real weight off my shoulders, truth be told.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You never seemed particularly concerned even before, sir. Must say you're very good at hiding your worries.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And I could say the same to you! Look, I know you were concerned for my wellbeing. Now you don't have to be. And I'll still be around to help you out. Good feeling, isn't it?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You must have seen everything there is to see here in your father's Underworld, haven't you, Prince? I figure that there isn't any place nicer than this!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh! Well, I suppose now that you're free, you could always see for yourself? It's pretty different as soon as you reach Asphodel. Don't you have someplace or somebody you'd like to see?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll take what's coming to me right here, thank you very much. You're the wayfaring sort, but my wayfaring days are over. It's hard to explain, but... this is a much-needed fresh start for me.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I will have you know, Prince, that your visits here have become a very important part of my routine!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"And what routine is that, exactly, sir?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, the routine of looking forward, of course! I try to appreciate the moment as much as anybody, but you know? It's always nice having something to look forward to. So, see you next time, then?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I heard straight from the source the Fury Megaera's been giving you a time, there, hasn't she. Trust me I know the feeling, so, I'm grateful that you're here and that she's not. You give her hell for me next time, won't you?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
Oh I'll get her for the both of us one of these days. Nights? Whenever.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Prince, I heard you showed that Fury Sister the what-for, is that the truth? Might explain why I've been left here to my own devices for a change.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I don't think she'll be out of commission for very long. She'd best find you minding that boulder, though at least you managed to catch a break for now. Be seeing you, Sisyphus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now you be careful out there, Highness. The kindly Megaera is out for blood. She kept on groaning 'bout the last exchange between the two of you. You must have showed her good!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I think I might have gotten lucky.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hey, Prince Z., I heard the strangest rumor, here's the thing, I'll give it to you straight. I have heard you've been consorting both with Megaera the Fury and with that old stiff, Thanatos, can you believe it?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, I don't know where you heard that, but... it's true. They're... they're just doing their jobs, and I... I know how it looks, but... you're my friend, as well, and I don't want you to forget that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I... look, I do appreciate the sentiment, Your Highness, I'm just surprised. I thought we shared a common foe in them, is all. What can I say, I hope that someday I can see them how you see them.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Thank you for understanding, sir. Besides... maybe I can get them to cut you some slack.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sisyphus, I have to be up front with you. The Fury Megaera and Thanatos... I know you're not exactly on the best of terms with either one of them. But they're both close to me. You won't hold it against me, sir, will you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Look, Prince, it's not for me to judge you, or your friends. The Fury Sisters, Master Thanatos... we got off on the wrong foot, you could say. My fault, entirely. I'd sooner make sure that our correspondence here doesn't make those relationships more difficult.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't even say that, sir. I think Meg and Than know me better than that by now. Well, thanks for understanding, as always.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Certainly, Highness. And who knows? Perhaps as you spend more time together, some of your finer qualities will rub off on those two!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"How goes it with old Master Thanatos of late, Prince Z.? Is he at least less stern with you than with the poor mortals he's sent to take in here?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Oh, Thanatos is doing all right. Much like my father, I think he feels he has some sort of fearsome reputation to uphold. Or maybe he's perpetually stressed over his work. But he's been well lately.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's good, I guess! Always appreciated that he ultimately took me in, rather than having to show up here through much more sudden, much more painful means. Didn't stop me from trying to avoid the trip, of course.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Word is you've caused quite the hubbub in Elysium, Prince Z.! Making the champion up there really work for it, I hear?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You could say that, I guess! Apparently word gets around. That Theseus, though... he doesn't care for me one bit, let me tell you!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I bet he'd like you better if you were a regular pushover! Ah, well, he'll learn, I'm sure.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prince, you've been gone for quite a while, why... I heard-tell you made it all the way outside! And I believed it for a while there, yet here you are. What happened, might I ask?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I made it out of here, indeed, sir. I always said that I was leaving, but... turns out there was good reason for me to come back. Not the least of which is visiting my friends from time to time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, I am certainly delighted to hear that! So long as you achieved what you set out to do. But, what brings you back again this way? More than a social visit I presume.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're right. I'm back because... I'm leaving once again. Something I have to do if I get up there, though I should be back before long either way, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Going to try and make it out of here again and again, is it? Well they say repetition is the key to mastery, Prince Z. Now here, I'll send you on your way.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"So, how do you like the surface, hey, Prince Z.? Now that you've finally had a chance to see it for yourself. Not too bad, I hope?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It takes some getting used to, that's for sure. I'm not sure I'll ever grow completely accustomed to it. Do you miss it, sir?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you know. I still have almost everything that matters, and the rest? It makes for precious memories I didn't have up there.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So, all this time, Prince, when you were battling up to the surface, and all that... you were searching for her, weren't you? The Queen?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was. Although, between us, sir, it's important that you keep that one a secret, please. Did... you happen to meet her, ever?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, just the one time, briefly, when your father decided to put me here. And, you have my word, of course. About the... surface stuff.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Prince Z., my understanding is the Queen herself is back, is that correct? Moreover, I have heard a truly fascinating rumor about her...",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That I'm her son...? It's true, sir. And she's back with us for now, indeed. I think we're all still getting used to it, but... it feels good, having her in my life.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That's wonderful to hear. I'd always heard good things about that one. No wonder such a quality runs in the family.,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Just one thing I don't understand, Prince Z., if you'll indulge me for a moment, here. If everything is all right for you at the House, then... why is it you're fighting to the surface, still?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you know. Wouldn't want Father to get too comfortable thinking this place is foolproof. It has a terrifyingly ominous reputation to uphold! There is no escape.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sure, that makes sense! Well, from a certain point of view. Escape over and over to prove it can't be done! I like that. Well, let's both of us keep at it, then!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not working yourself too hard of late, are you, Prince Z.? Remembering to take some breaks from time to time, and all?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I think I'm managing, thanks, sir. Though, back when you pushed Bouldy rather than talked to him... I suppose you didn't have much of a choice, did you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, it was work, you know? Even your Father has to work. Of course, I've since retired! But it seems you and he like to keep yourselves occupied. Whatever makes you feel content.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Say, that's my Shattered Shackle on your person, right, Prince Z.? I'd recognize that clunky thing from anywhere. It serving you all right?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Hey sir, certainly it's been most welcome having something from you with me at all times. Though has it always held this power? And... how did you remove it to begin with?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bit of an odd story, that. Involved a well-timed accident with the old boulder there. Though, I'd best not get into it so that you're not accomplice to that little crime. Surely you understand?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My Shattered Shackle's practically like new, there, Prince! Minus the part where it's still broken, and all that. Nice work!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thanks, sir. It's been of help through my repeated treks across this realm, all thanks to you. You sure you don't want it back?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hahahahah! Absolutely not, though truly I appreciate the sentiment. I'd rather have a look at the old boulder there than a symbol of the time I first got stuck here, when I wasn't doing quite as well.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Word is that the most beautiful music's been heard up in Asphodel, lately, Prince! From the sound of it, why... I think that has got to be Eurydice and Orpheus!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You heard correctly, Sisyphus! Orpheus is reunited with his muse, at last. Or at least, he gets to visit on the regular, when he isn't busy at my father's house. So you've heard of them, have you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I've more than heard of them! I'm sure you know how Orpheus once ventured all the way down here, after Eurydice passed on. I'll never forget his song! Even the Fury Sisters gave me a break, they were so captivated by it, then. Ah, good times. For me, at least!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prince Z., it seems you've brought my little Shady back to visit me! How very kind. And I can tell he's in good care of late.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"He is, sir, and I'm grateful once again to have adopted him. You sure you don't want him back, though? Always seems like you could use a friend.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All due respect, Highness, but I've the best friend anyone can ask for to my right just there. And as for little Shady, he was more inclined than I to see the farthest reaches of the Underworld. Safe travels to you both!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, sir? Have you any idea how Shady works? I'm able to just whisk both you and Bouldy out of here, and to my aid? It must be awfully disorienting.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Prince, I told you that we'd be with you in spirit, didn't I? It's not just Shady's power, I suppose, nor is it Bouldy's or my hidden strength. It's testament to our companionship, is all. You gods are capable of anything!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"She's gone... You still in one piece, Sisyphus? Not hurt or anything?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I'm just fine, thanks, Prince. That Fury Sister, she is quite a lass, I have to say, and very, very strong. Bet she could push old Bouldy here better than I!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You've really never gotten Bouldy to the top before?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Never got the boulder to the top, not even once. Always tumbles down right at the very end. Lost count after the nineteen thousandth time or so, but you know what? One of these days, I bet it's going to stick.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, did I just hear correctly that Megaera has vowed to leave you be for now? Both you and Bouldy there?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, I believe you heard just that, Your Highness! Seems the Fates are giving me a break. Although, the Fury Sister did declare that she'll be back to haunting me after she's through with you...",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, I bet I can keep her busy for a while yet. I'll take it as a bit of good news, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I'm doing very well, thanks, Prince. I'm not afraid of him, I mean, what have I got to lose? Now here, I wanted you to have this.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Can you believe the nerve of that one, Prince? He's nothing but a blowhard, so, I simply tell him what he wants to hear! He can't stop me from helping you, besides. I'm dead already, what's he going to do?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Prince Z.! Just missed your stern-faced colleague, feel that stillness hanging in the air? Sounds like he won't be checking up on me again anytime soon.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Thanatos really isn't such a bad sort once you get to know him, sir. Though, I suppose you'll have to take my word for that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I believe it, Highness. I should think that bringing death must be a lonely job. Perhaps he ought to try pushing a boulder sometime!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Good to see you in one piece, Prince Z.!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Life treating you all right, I take it, Prince?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I'm hanging in there, thanks for asking, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You'll make it out of here, I've no doubt about it!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Nice of you to drop in for a bit!,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You are a sight for sore eyes, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Now you be careful out there, won't you, Prince?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You give them hell for me, all right, Prince Z.?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Go get them for me, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Got just the thing for you here, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"It's always good to see you, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You keep your chin up, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Keep fighting the good fight, there, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Hey you take care, you hear me, Prince?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Let's both of us keep going, that a deal?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It's good of you to visit me like this!,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
Hope everything's been well enough of late.,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You watch your step out there, all right, Prince Z.?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Hullo Highness, you're looking well enough!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, Your Highness, how goes it, how is everything?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
I have to say it's good to see a friendly face!,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Always a pleasure, Highness, you take care out there.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Here's my best friend in all the Underworld, how goes it, Prince?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Glad you made it all this way, Prince Z.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Think I've got just the thing for you right here, Highness!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"A brief hello from time to time does wonders, don't you think, Prince Z.?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Much as I like the company of Bouldy there, you're always welcome, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Stop by whenever you're around these parts, all right, Prince Z.?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I know it isn't much, Highness, but I do hope this helps!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Here's something courtesy of me and Bouldy, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How about a little bit of help as you keep on your journey, Prince?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Let's see if we might make your going slightly easier, there, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Should have something that ought to come in handy for you, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"No need for these, so take one off my hands, won't you, Prince Z.?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Bouldy and I have got the usual for you right here, Your Highness.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Highness, please take one of these and go!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"All's well out here in Tartarus, Prince Z.! What will it be?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Bouldy and I got our usual selection here, Highness!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't let me keep you, Prince, I know you've plenty of important business here.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Before you go, Prince Z., a little souvenir from your fine stay in Tartarus.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Don't do anything I wouldn't do out there, you hear me, Prince?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're looking good and ready for whatever lies ahead up there, Prince Z.!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know approximately where to find me if you happen to be in the area again, Prince Z.!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Everything's fine as ever here, Prince Z., so you go on ahead, and don't look back!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I have a feeling you are going to make it all the way topside this time, Highness!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Need a little pick-me-up perhaps?,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bouldy and I will always be here in your time of need, Prince Z.!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Bouldy says whatever we can do to help, we'll do it, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"In case words of encouragement are not enough, have one of these here, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Let's get you on your way, Prince Z., and in good spirits, too!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Don't you worry, Highness, we have got you covered here!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
Told old Bouldy here you'd probably be back if only to say hi!,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey Prince, Bouldy and I will not be needing these, but maybe they can help!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Just do the best you can, if you don't mind me saying so, Prince Z.!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Speaking for myself and Bouldy there, we're always at your service, Prince.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You get all the way up to the top and do whatever it is needs getting done, Highness!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I know Bouldy believes in you every bit as much as I do, Prince!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hey, sir, thought this might ease your burden for a while.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Now hold a moment, Highness, I cannot accept something like this... not without giving back a little something in return, that is!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, my, you're really giving that to me, there, Prince? But, I'm just, why would you...?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You better believe it, sir. Now you take care, be seeing you around.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Why, Prince, you being serious right now, is that for me?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You deserve better, Sisyphus! This really isn't much, but maybe it'll help you while away the days. Nights. Whatever time it is.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wow, Your Highness, you... you really shouldn't have. Thank you for not forgetting about me.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You're always a sight for sore eyes out here, Sisyphus. Thank you for always believing in me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm really very flattered, Highness! You didn't have to get me anything, I mean, your company's more than enough for me!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I figured you could do with something more than that this time around, good sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, but this is just too much for me, Your Highness, thank you, really. I don't know how I can ever repay you.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"How about you keep on helping me not die as quickly as I might have otherwise, deal?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sisyphus, sir? You've helped me selflessly time after time without so much as asking anything in return. Wanted to say I'm very grateful, and thought you might like to try this. Here, for a special occasion!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Why, Prince, is this...? It is...! I've not so much as seen a bottle of it, much less sampled it, thank you so much! Although, with all respect, I cannot rightfully accept such a fine gift. Unless...",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Unless...? Oh no, you're not making me take something in return, you know this was a gift not an exchange, sir, right? Wait, what is that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This, Highness, is a little friend of mine kept tucked away in Bouldy's care. Wherever you'll be going next, he'll make a worthy traveling companion. And when he's with you, Bouldy and I... we'll be with you in spirit, too.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusElbowing,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yeah I hope so too.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Prince, that vintage Ambrosia bottle that you gave me, my! That was the greatest thing I ever tried, I think! Even Bouldy enjoyed the stuff!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I thought you'd like it, sir. And so, I'm pleased to offer you another! Almost a shame we seldom get such imports from Olympus around here. I hope I can appreciate it for myself sometime. Once all this is over with, I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What? You mean that you've never touched the stuff yourself? You've much more self control than I have, there. Perhaps someday we'll have a chance to share some between us!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Yeah I hope so too.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Prince, that vintage Ambrosia bottle that you gave me, my! That was the greatest thing I ever tried, I think! Even Bouldy enjoyed the stuff!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"I thought you'd like it, sir. And so, I'm pleased to offer you another! Almost a shame we seldom get such imports from Olympus around here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, look at what the Prince has brought for us, Bouldy! Perhaps someday we'll have a chance to share some between us!",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
SisyphusExplaining,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You guys are great.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All this, for someone such as me. You know I'm down here for a reason, don't you, Prince? Not just because your father and good Thanatos don't care for me. Yet, from the very first, you showed me decency I'd not experienced since I was a king. Perhaps not even then.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Whoever it was you used to be, sir, I believe you've changed. And I'm proud to say that you're my friend. And Bouldy there as well. It's odd for me to say, but I am glad you're here. I think I've learned a lot from you, about all this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, Your Highness, I am honored very much indeed, and having you amongst my list of friends makes it perhaps the greatest such a list a fellow such as I has ever had. Isn't that right, Bouldy?",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
.   .   .   .,CHARACTER,Bouldy,male
"Take it from me, Prince Z., Bouldy concurs.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Wait, really, this, this is for me, you mean it, Prince? I mean, I won't say no, I can't say no to such a thing, so, thank you! Thank you kindly.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"You're more than welcome, sir. For all you've done for me, it's the least I could do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...I'm really rather speechless, Your Highness. I'm just a shade doing my time. I don't deserve your generosity.",CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male
"Come on, sir, what's a priceless bottle of the drink of the gods between friends?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sir, is this a mint-condition Shady you just gave to me?! I'm so grateful. I will keep him safe!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Thanks for that, sir.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sure thing!,CHARACTER,Sisyphus,male

"I'll figure something out. But you do something for me, in the meantime: Don't give in to what you're feeling now, all right? Achilles loves you still, like you don't know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm past the point of making promises, but... thank you for your words. I love him still, in turn. I pray the Fates help you in your endeavors, there.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"He's just as obstinate as ever, isn't he? Always refused to budge. He ever tell you of the war in which we fought? I fought, I should say. He could have ended it. But he refused to take up arms.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Achilles hasn't been particularly forthcoming about his mortal days, no. So he wouldn't fight? I've heard that mortals sometimes frown on that, but... why should he have fought if he didn't believe in the cause?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He shared our cause! So what if it was not completely his? If not for his stubbornness, I... well... I would have come here just a bit later, I think.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"He blames himself for what happened to you, you know. I figured he failed to defend you or something, not that... he didn't fight at all. Although, he said something about how, once you died, he shortly followed in a rage...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I wouldn't know a thing about that, stranger, for you see... I was already dead. Getting my place here in the afterlife all sorted out. Took quite some time, getting accustomed to all this.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"A question, if you don't mind, stranger? Because, I've had one nagging at me since we last discussed the subject. What, exactly, happened to Achilles, can you say? After I died, that is. I've heard the rumors, but... I don't trust any of this boastful lot.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Well, from what I gathered, sir... after you fell, he was overcome with grief. And anger. He joined the war, just like you urged. And, single-handedly, he almost ended it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So then, he threw away his life. Soon enough after I lost mine. Yet, despite vanquishing an army on his own, he wound up in the lowest pits of Tartarus? Instead of here, among the great?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You should know, sir. You were buried together. Your ashes, that is. It was his final request. As for how he came to be at my father's house, that's something I think he can best explain. And I will do everything I can to make sure that he has the opportunity.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Our ashes, you say. Together? Tsk. The fool. We could have lived! Not been reduced to meal for the worms. But... I appreciate the information, stranger. Now... please, go.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"...Forgive me, stranger. For, in retrospect, I was too terse after you told me what became of my Achilles. Tales of his climactic battle, I had heard. The stuff about... his ashes, and my own... that was all new.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"No need to even ask forgiveness, sir. Achilles is one of my closest friends, but.. he doesn't care to talk about himself. About those times. It must be very painful. For the both of you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, we've all seen our share of pain, by now. But... knowing that he cared for me, in the end... after the end... it dulls the feeling of it, for a bit. As do these conversations, I guess.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I've meant to ask you something, stranger. Would you mind doing me a favor, please? If it happens to come up along your path. Suppose I ought to tell it to you first, prior to asking a response.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"No, of course, sir, what is it? What's on your mind?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"If I know my Achilles, then he's being rather guarded, when it comes to this predicament we're in. How can somebody be so brash yet hate to take unnecessary risks? Just let him know I said to risk it all.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Risk it all? Risk what all? He wants what's best for you. He wouldn't want anything to happen.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It's already long since happened. I daresay that, right now, provided what you've said is true, then... it appears we've more to gain than lose. Isn't fear for the weak?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I thought we might run into you, but... how strange to see you face-to-face out here, lad. To see this place myself. I still can't quite believe any of this...",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"He really can't. Though I keep telling him, it's true. Nothing's accomplished without risk, isn't that so? But, we of course have you to thank, stranger. Our troubles needn't have been your concern.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Nonsense, sir. You're my friend. And Achilles... I don't know where I would even be, if not for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, no need to get emotional, is there? We myrmidons, we're not the sentimental type. Achilles is simply on break, is all. From a demanding job. You've a demanding job as well, so here! My customary gift.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Well if it isn't the ward of Achilles, come to visit us. I don't know how I can ever repay you, stranger. I'm quite sure that it isn't possible.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I reached more or less the same conclusion, Pat.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"How about you just keep offering me those premium goods you have no interest in when I pass through, and we can call it even, sir?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That I had plans to do, regardless, though... if you should think of something else at any point, please do let either of us know.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Good, there you are, stranger. Settle something for us quickly, hm? Would Achilles not make for the perfect Champion of Elysium? For I think almost anybody would be better than the current one.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I think I'd rather maintain watch over a nearly empty hall than battle all the shades around here, Pat.",CHARACTER,Achilles,male
"I, too, would vastly prefer having to contend with Theseus rather than yourself, Achilles. Although, that's not to say I disagree that almost anybody would be better in the role than him.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"It seems, then, I am overruled. But I know Champion material when I see it, and I see it now.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Achilles is returned to work for now... but, waiting for him, knowing he'll return... rather than waiting for the sake of it, for nothing... such a different feeling, stranger. I'd forgotten it entirely, I think.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I'm happy for the both of you. So, is everything all right, then? The circumstances under which you were separated in life... it's unimaginable, really. How does one move on from a thing like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Anger fades, I guess, stranger. Even the famous anger of Achilles. Anger burns hot, then burns out. What's left is a dull ache, but... underneath it, there was something else. It felt as though... well, I was still alive. That feeling... it's worth holding onto.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"It's good to see you again, stranger. You don't mind if I keep calling you that, no? Couldn't find a better nickname for you, after all. Besides... I don't want to cause you any trouble.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Don't mind at all, Patroclus, sir. Coming from you I consider it a term of endearment.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You have my thanks for that...,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Achilles tells me that you're here to stay, at least for now, stranger. A welcome bit of news. Assuming, of course, that it's for the best, for you?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I think so, sir. I'll still be passing through, and visiting the surface every opportunity I get. But it seems my place really is here. Besides, it means getting to see you every now and then, like this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That sounds agreeable to me. Then, you take care.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"There's been considerable talk of late about the Queen Persephone, stranger. Your mother, it would seem? Sounds to me your tale's almost as complicated as my own.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"It's a long story, at this point, indeed. But yes. The Queen... my mother... she's returned. And, it's been really good, having her back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I can only begin to imagine. May she help govern all of this with wisdom and with grace.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"This spearpoint that you gave me, sir. It's been quite useful, though I have to ask you... is there any particular significance to it? Most spearpoints aren't imbued with power such as this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that. Just something I'd been meaning to get rid of, but... it can be difficult, discarding trifles from the past. Knowing it's provided you some benefit is welcome news.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Did you once wield a spear yourself, sir? In your fighting days?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Did I once wield a spear? You could say that I did. I had my moments with it, anyway. Even once slew a demigod! He's probably somewhere about. Quite awkward, running into those you killed. But in Elysium it's all taken in stride.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Whatever happened with that war you mentioned, sir? If you don't mind my asking.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, truth be told, here, stranger... I do mind. You speak as one who's not experienced a war. Those of us who survived... or, you know what I mean... we do bear some responsibility to history. But, all the same, it's not a time and place to which I would return. I trust you'll understand.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I always wondered, sir. What was Achilles like...? During his youth, I mean. If you can say.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Hah. How to describe what somebody was like? Everyone who saw him on the battlefield agreed he was magnificent, stranger. His allies and his enemies alike. But, there was more to him, I think. A certain outlook. A sense of justice. I knew him before he was a warrior. Only reason I suppose I liked him.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I heard you've vanquished Theseus however many times of late. Or... someone matching your description has, stranger. Almost had to laugh when I heard that. Though, I suspect he hasn't learnt a thing.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"What, you know him? Though, yes, he does seem rather set in his ways. Convinced himself that I'm some sort of demon from the lowest depths. Which... well, it's partly true, I guess.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're quite notorious, around these parts. The tales of your father's monstrous son, kept under lock and key within his House. Fear and ignorance make for great stories, no?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Couldn't help but hear the rattling of battle chariots of late. Raucous laughter and the like. You've really riled up the locals this time, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Must be Theseus and his fancy Macedonian. So he's been joyriding about in that thing? Showing it off?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your arrivals are becoming a bit of an event, I'd say. And, yes, the Champion and his bull friend are likely at the center of it. You'll have to forgive me that I've no intent on attending your contests, but... well, here.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You know, for such a loudmouth obnoxious braggart, Theseus does seem to have formed a strong kinship with the Bull of Minos, hasn't he. Are they truly as inseparable as they seem? I feel bad for the Bull.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Sometimes it's our differences that make us drawn to one another, no? And, at other times, there's no accounting for taste. I often don't know which is which, and they can have each other, far as I'm concerned.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Even the Bull of Minos couldn't stop you, huh. That's one whose way I would stay out of if I could, but... well, you'd not be here if you couldn't handle yourself, I guess.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You heard I battled with Asterius, here, sir? I thought you kept more to your own devices. Weren't much for conversation with the other shades.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you're correct in that assessment, stranger. But, as you've seen, I've no ability to stop others from coming and going as they please. So I do tend to hear a thing or two from passersby.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You must have met so many great heroes in your day, having fought alongside Achilles... do you still keep in touch with any of them, here?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Great heroes... haven't you seen, by now, what they are like, stranger? Not all entirely what they're cracked up to be. But, there were good ones, yes. Suppose they're mostly keeping to themselves. Like I am here. Perhaps we'll run into each other, down the line.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Never quite considered... you're related to the gods upon Olympus, aren't you, stranger...? I should be far more careful around you.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"What do you mean by that, sir? Though, yes, my father being who he is, it means I have a lot of uncles, cousins, and the like, up on the surface, there.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well... you would be wise to watch yourself, with some of them, I think. Don't get on anyone's bad side, if you can help it. Which, when I yet lived, none of us could.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You ever been in love with someone, stranger? Might be a mortals-only thing, for all I know. You gods have strange relationships, I hear.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I have been, sir. Or, I should say, I am.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, that's good. Cling to the feeling, then. And if you lose it... reach for it. Search for it, no matter what, all right? Because, without it... well, there isn't much of a comparison, I think.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You ever been in love with someone, stranger? Might be a mortals-only thing, for all I know. You gods have strange relationships, I hear.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Not sure that I have been, sir. I understand it's one of those things where, you'll know it when it happens.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Perhaps you shall, someday or night down here. The feeling comes with pain, and plenty of it, but... the pain is worth it, in my limited experience. And once you find that feeling, cling to it. As tightly as you can. If you don't mind my saying.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Well, what's it going to be this time, stranger? The HydraLite? Maybe the Kiss of Styx?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You sure you don't need any of this stuff, sir? I really appreciate it, but... I don't want to take it for granted.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, come, this is Elysium. Taking such things for granted is the point. We gloried shades receive our stipend of the finest goods, so we can battle till we've had our fill. But I've already had my fill, I think.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You've ample time for fishing, have you, stranger? And here I thought you'd more important business to attend to, though it's not for me to judge, I guess.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I'll have you know some of us take matters of fishing very seriously, sir! Besides... helps take my mind off having to fight your Elysian brethren nonstop.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh I'd not take your mind off this fight if it's one that you hope to win, stranger. I once took my mind off a fight, and, well... I wound up here.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I have to tell you, sir, it was a real sight to see you fighting alongside Achilles. You two were amazing!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I'm a little rusty. But he's not. Still very much in tiptop shape, except more able to control his temper, I should think.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Don't sell yourself so short! Though, I thought you laid down your spear forever. Why choose to fight again?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Achilles swayed me into realizing some activity may be quite good for me. And besides... if we can aid you in a pinch, that's worth my while.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You look positively beaten, there, stranger. Let's see if we can't get you on your feet. For I can do the listless sitting for the both of us.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Oh, you look terrible, if I may say, stranger. Perhaps one of these trinkets can be of some small help.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You again? Then, here. Fates know I'll not be needing this.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Move right along, stranger. Let's skip the pleasantries.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
And here I thought you must have given up already.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Enjoying the splendors of Elysium, yet, stranger?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Don't let me interrupt your stay in paradise, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Returned to take more of these trinkets off my hands, have you?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Oh, it's only you again, stranger. It's only me, as well.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Take one of these and then just leave me be, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I'd like to be alone again, stranger, so you go on ahead.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"No need to linger with me, stranger. Go.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Why your path keeps on crossing mine, I've not the slightest clue.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Some other time, stranger. Right now I'm preoccupied with sitting here.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"There's nothing you can do to help me, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Can't you see I'm busy whiling away for all eternity?,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"A fine whatever time it is to you, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You haven't lost your will just yet, I see.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Expecting I'll still be right here next time, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Just go, already, towards your next death or whatever else awaits.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You're back again, I see. And just in time to take one of these blasted things from me.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I'll wait for him, however long it takes. You tell him that.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
I pray Achilles is surviving well. And same for you.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"It's good of you to visit, though there's little I can offer in return.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Please make yourself at home here in this corner of eternal paradise.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Do let Achilles know I'm doing well, and I'll be ever patient, here.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
I doubt there's much that I can do for you.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"You're interfering with my quiet time, you know.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Yes, what is it, this time?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Here's what I have that I can spare right now.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Might I somehow assist you, then?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Oh good, somebody's here to save me from myself.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"How can I be of use to you, stranger?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I've no shortage of time to spare, I guess.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Ah, just a stranger passing through, I see.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Not in the mood for conversation now, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Go on about your business, there, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Good fortune getting out of here, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Here's something for the journey still to come.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Prepared to face the champion, soon, stranger?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"May this aid you against the champion, out there.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Be careful with my brethren out there, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Battle with glory and all that, all right, stranger?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I would prefer to be alone for now, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Just don't go starting any wars you don't intend to finish, stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Leave me be to my eternal paradise, damn you.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I shall not take up arms again, stranger, not even against you.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Begone from here, we've nothing to discuss.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Go haunt some other corner of this realm; this one is mine.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
I thought I told you to leave me alone?,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
Do I look like I want to talk to you?,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
What is it that you want from me this time?,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
What would it take for you to leave me be?,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Yes, what is it this time?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
What would you have me do?,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"IsIdAlive  563036,",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male

Achilles and I were just passing the time I guess.,CHARACTER,Patroclus,male

ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ahh, so you are taking pity on me, then? Well, I've no pride like many others here, so I shall take it. Though, let's make it a fair exchange, shall we?",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Why would you waste a proper vintage on the likes of me? Questions that are better left unanswered, I would guess.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"If this eases your burden even for a little while, then it's in good hands, as far as I'm concerned.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, a means to drown my sorrows temporarily. That's good. And rather kind of you, I have to say.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"It's nothing. Thank you for not trying to slay me where I stand and boast about it, like seemingly everyone else around here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh. Here in Elysium you have to win this stuff, so I have rarely had occasion to enjoy it. Thanks.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I'd say you earned it more than anybody else I've seen around here, lately. Though I don't make the rules.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You owe me neither time nor generosity, and certainly not this. But if you truly have no better use for it...",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"It's not a matter of owe, sir. Please open your mind to the possibility, nay the fact, that there are those who care about your wellbeing.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Just the relief from misery that I was looking for. A fleeting feeling, really, but I'll take a fleeting feeling over none.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"That's both very dejected and very astute of you to say. Take care of yourself, will you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Here, sir. The drink of the gods, themselves. Thought maybe you would like to try it! Just a small token of my appreciation for your selflessness with me, time after time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You'd give the precious gift of Ambrosia to someone like me, stranger? A gloried thing like that. Why bother...? I should be just another shade to you.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"Well, you're not. You're someone I look forward to seeing here in Elysium, which is more than I can say for just about anybody else around here, so... please, enjoy it. Perhaps with Achilles.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well... perhaps I'll try. You're not so bad, you know that, stranger? Careful with that, or you'll undermine the ruthless reputation that you have.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"I don't see that last bottle of Ambrosia anywhere, which I can only take to mean... you need another. Here, sir. Thanks for seeing me through all of this, time after time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're thanking me, stranger? I've been here for some time, I think, and yet... some of your customs I'll admit remain quite strange to me. You've done more for me than I've any right to expect, from anyone.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male
"It's just a bottle of Ambrosia, sir, it's really no big deal. OK, fine, it's rather difficult to come by, but still!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"You jest, but I do not. I'd offer you my lifelong gratitude, but... well, you know.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male

"And... I'm Patroclus, by the way. I'm realizing now... we've not officially met. It's good to know you, Zagreus. Stranger.",CHARACTER,Patroclus,male

"I'm not going out of my way, sir. Look, I don't pretend to know the depths of your despair. But when I look at you, I'm reminded of how I've often felt. When I was in that dark place, someone said to me: Don't give up. If nothing else... it gives you something to do.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He put you up to this? Look, hon, why don't you get on with your business, then. But you can't leave empty-handed, that's the rule, so take your pick, my treat! Nothing for him, though.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, hon, what's going on, speak up! I know when something's up down to my roots, and something's up.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Well it's just, I think that you may know an Orpheus, don't you? Quite musically inclined, a little dour, impressive hair? He's court musician in my father's house. Calls you his muse. Says he misses you terribly. I... thought you should know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown

"What is it, hon? Oh no, don't tell me you've come all the way from Tartarus to ask me more about your good-for-nothing court musician friend.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Certainly not! I'm merely here for your wonderful singing, cooking, or conversational ability. Though, since you mentioned it, you... seem to have a lot to say to him. Is there anything I can do?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So let me see if I understand. Orpheus blew it with me like an idiot, but now I'm supposed to be reaching out to him? Sorry, hon, but that's not happening. The two of us are finished. And, you know what? I think we're finished here, too. If you'll excuse me!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey there, hon! So what do you think, pretty good tune, right? Don't know how come everybody doesn't sing. Lightens the mood, passes the time. What's not to like?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"It's a beautiful song. Even though you're angry with him... Orpheus, I mean... you're always singing, still?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh it's not Orpheus' song, you kidding me? This one's all mine. He always did like going on about how I'm his muse, well, that's 'cause I wrote half his songs for him! Bet he didn't mention that, did he.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Well, not exactly in those words, but... Orpheus can be a little hard to parse.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He can be a little hard to tolerate. A quality I hope isn't going to rub off on any of his mates. I should get back to practicing, see you.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female

ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsk... and what am I supposed to do with that, Your Royal Majesty...?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"I... I don't know yet. Though, you know what? You shouldn't take my word for it. You should take his.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't think I will be running into him anytime soon from what I understand. But you're the Hades kid! You want to pull some strings on our behalf, go right ahead, I guess. But I won't hold my breath. Even if I could.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"So, uh, how's Orpheus been doing lately, anyway? Still keeping his hair in those neat little curls? I guess his tan must have faded by now.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Curls? Erm, not exactly, no. But he's doing all right! For him. He's started singing again, lately, which was a big step. He never used to, before. Would go on about how he'd lost his muse.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And now he knows I'm out there, still, huh. That's... well, thank you for the update, hon. Music's his gift. Good to know he's not thrown everything away.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Eurydice, can I ask you for a favor here? Not that you owe me anything, but, would you hear me out?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah, sure, hon, what is it? Though you had better not be asking for my recipes. Closely guarded family secret! I'd say I'd take them to my grave, but... yeah.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"It's not your recipes, though they are wonderful. It's your song. I'm sure it'd be a hit around the House! And, I know someone who really needs to hear it. Don't suppose you've got a parchment-copy I could have?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your Royal Majesty, you want my song? You are aware it's called 'Good Riddance', right? Tsk, but sure, why not. If music's going to be playing in your House, it might as well be great. And let me give you something to go with it.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"...What'd he say, hon? I mean about the song. Bet he loved it, didn't he! But, I don't know for sure. And I've been wondering, kind of a lot, I guess.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"No need to wonder any longer. He sings it beautifully, around the House sometimes. It... has a sadder sound to it than when you sing, but... you've inspired him again. As you've done many times before, from what I know.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Huh. So it's a hit, is what you're saying, then. I had a feeling about that one. Sometimes you put some words together and right then and there, you know that you've got something special.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"What happens now, hon...? What I mean is... now you got me thinking about Orpheus again, so... what am I supposed to do with that?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Even if you can't be together right now, I hope it feels better knowing how much he cares for you. And I will try to pull some strings, like you said. I can't make promises where my father's concerned, but... I'll do everything I can.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, what can I tell you? Thanks, Your Royal Majesty. That means a lot. No pressure, though. I've been all right without him all this time, and I will be all right, no matter what. If only he could say the same.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, listen here a moment, Hades kid. Look, I... Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. For bringing Orphy back to me again, and everything.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Eurydice, you're more than welcome, really. You've helped me through the flames of hell, time after time. Least I could do is coax old Orpheus out of his private pit of despair so you and he could set things right between the two of you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, you're a real sweetheart, hon. You'll still be seeing Orphy all the time around your House, but now, I get to see him, too. Nice having something to look forward to, you know? Bet someone out there feels that about you.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey! What's the matter, Your Royal Majesty? You're looking kind of down. Normally you're all smiles, for whatever reason!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Oh, I... well, looking back, all this stuff between you and Orpheus, I realized... well, I hope I wasn't too pushy about the whole thing. It wasn't any of my business to pry into your personal life. I should have asked.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that? Pff, come on, don't even worry about it. If you were being too pushy, you better believe I would have put you back in your place, royalty or not. But hey, can't ever be too careful when it comes to people's past and feelings and stuff, right?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Got to tell you, hon. Orpheus sure is different since last he and I met. You know, back when he was still living and breathing and all.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"I think the experience of trying to rescue you, failing, dying, becoming court musician, refusing to sing, then being locked in solitary confinement, then finding out about you probably did a number on him. Why, is everything all right? You seemed to be getting along last I saw.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, we're getting along great! Better than ever. He used to be a bit more of a hotshot, but now it's like, he's a little more... what's the word... sensitive? Now I can always tell exactly what's on his mind.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, Your Royal Majesty! I must say you've accomplished some truly amazing feats, according to Orphy at least! But don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Oh, no, he's been boasting of my fabricated exploits to you? I've tried to tell him I was only joking with him but now he just thinks I'm being modest.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That modesty won't get you anywhere with me, either, hon, Your Greatness. I'm honored to merely be in the presence of one with so many wild exploits to sing or speak of!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey did Orpheus really use to have curls, and... something called a tan? I've only ever seen him looking... well, how he does now.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He did! And a tan is like... well, when you stay out in the hot sun up there long enough, your skin kind of starts to bake a little bit. But nicer than that sounds! Got to say, though, the years have been kind to Orphy, don't you think?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Say, tell me something, there, Your Royal Majesty. You know a lot of shades. You wouldn't happen to know an Orpheus, would you? Spindly little thing, whiny voice? Heard he's officially serving in your court. Making music!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Of course I know Orpheus, we're mates! Wait, why do you ask?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're mates, huh. Just as long as you don't count on him for anything. Hasn't even mentioned me, has he. Well if he ever does, you tell him I am doing great! I'm great.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"What's the latest, hon, anything been happening down in your fancy House lately?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Well, you mentioned Orpheus... my father had him locked up for a little while for refusing to sing. Being court musician and all. But he's out now, and doing OK! I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not following instructions, huh. Sounds like Orpheus, all right. Well, if that's the most exciting thing you've got going on, then I haven't missed much being out here.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, what's up, hon? Say, you must know a lot of big shots, don't you? Other gods and all that?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"I know a few. As a matter of fact, I heard recently from Hermes, wanted you to know he felt sorry for how things ended up. That something to do with when Orpheus went in here after you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that's sweet of him! Nice enough guy, for an Olympian. Yeah, he was the one who dropped me off here in the first place. No hard feelings here, he was just doing his job. It was Orpheus who messed everything up.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Sure don't see a lot of other nymphs around here, huh! We don't die too easy, most of us. Makes me feel all special!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"I've never met another nymph, now that you mention it. Heard of a few! The goddess Artemis, sounds like she spends more time with nymphs than the other Olympians.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's what I heard! Though it's not like we all hang out, I mean, you've got the dryads, and the naiads, and the nereids, and the oceanids... pretty much every type of terrain up top, there's a kind of nymph who loves it! Maybe we need a name for Underworld nymphs, too.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a Persephone during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, her? Yeah, she was with Hades Senior, why? Wait. Whoa. Are you...? I thought...",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"It's complicated. And, please keep it quiet. I was just wondering... what was she like? If you recall.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though. Look, I hope everything's OK.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Eurydice, did you by any chance ever meet a Persephone during the whole thing when Orpheus came down to try to get you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"Didn't get much of an impression, but I can tell you this: She had good taste in music! Orpheus and I, think we won her over with our little duet. Haven't seen or heard from her lately, though.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, everybody's saying Persephone... she's back? That sounds like a bit of good news, there, isn't that right, hon?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, she is back, and yes, it is good news, thank you. She and I have a lot of making up for lost time left to do, though I think we're off to a pretty decent start.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, that's a relief. And, you're still here! So I guess you've got more official business to take care of, which means I've still got somebody to taste-test for me every now and then!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Orphy tells me the Queen, she's been settling in just fine down at your House! Must be different having a lady like that around. How's Hades Senior taking it, if I may ask?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Oh, he's taking it... about as well as he's taken anything ever, now that you mention it. Still very much himself, mind you, but still... it's been a welcome change.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Glad to hear it! Orphy always liked singing for an audience more than I did, and it sounds like she's a good one.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"You ever play any music, or sing or anything yourself, Hades kid? It's good for you, you know!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"I play a bit of the lyre, as a matter of fact! Orpheus himself gave me some pointers on it. Never really tried singing, though. I can't even imagine it, really.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, might I recommend giving it a shot at some point? Who knows, you might be the next Orpheus!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"You been snacking on onions or something, there, hon? No offense or anything, but you smell like you ate a whole one of them raw.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Erm, yes, but... wait. How else are you supposed to eat those things?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, are you kidding me? You can grill them, sauté them, fry them, boil them, pickle them, roast them! Oh, hon. You've been missing out.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"You got anyone special in your life, by the way, hon? You seem like you'd be good for somebody out here.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"You know what, yes, I do, Eurydice. Things have moved so fast for me lately I barely stopped to think about it, though. It helps not having to go through everything alone... just knowing I'll see them again soon.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Know what you mean. And hey, that's great! Long as you can still be yourself. I've known too many nymphs, their whole lives revolved around somebody they loved. I bet whoever it is that loves you... it's because of who you are.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Eurydice, how long have you been down here, anyway, if you don't mind my asking? Seems like you're pretty settled in. It's quite a lovely place!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"How long have I been down here, hon? Huh! I don't have the faintest. You lose your sense of time once you're a shade, or maybe once there's not a sun or moon over your head. But yeah, I found myself a decent spot and fixed it up a bit!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"You're just in time, Your Royal Majesty! Got something real good cooking right here that you are going to love. You hungry, yeah?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
Am I ever. You're always so generous. And you're always cooking! And singing. Do you have many guests come by? Your place seems... somewhat off the beaten path.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, you think I get a lot of guests, here? Haha, no, but I like cooking anyway! It's like singing, in a way. Keep getting better the more you try, turns out a bit different each time.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Eurydice, how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts? Has it been magma-flooded like this all the time?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The searing heat? Haha, I am dead, Your Royal Majesty! Searing's just a cooking technique to me. Don't need to sleep, either! I can just keep cooking up a storm. It's not so bad!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"You know, I've never met a nymph before. You're closer to the gods than mortals, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah, gods that can die! How is that fair? Was just a stupid snake bite in my case, can you imagine something more embarrassing? You're just minding your business, and then snap! You're dead, and on your way down here.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
I... know the feeling better than you might expect.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, I was going to end up here sooner or later. Might as well while I'm still looking good. Though, I guess you do kind of get to lock in whatever age when you register. Bet everybody dying of old age pushed that one through.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"What's your official business, anyway, Your Royal Majesty? Seems like it's bringing you through Asphodel an awful lot lately.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"It's... look, the truth is, I am trying to get out of here. I've hit some stumbling blocks along the way, but, I think I will make it there, eventually.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh really! Say no more, I know how that is. Hope the Fates will look the other way for you. Getting out of here, huh. Not thought of that myself in I don't know how long...",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Of all the lava rocks in Asphodel, the Hades kid found this one once again, wouldn't you know! You got a map or something to this place, or what?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
Don't know that a map would help me much since things keep shifting out here every single time. Though it is an interesting coincidence how I keep running into you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Coincidence? Come on, hon, you're a god. Someone out there is sending you my way. Maybe it's just the Fates. Ah well! I sure don't mind a little company. And I have lots to eat!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"RequiresMaxKeepsake  true,",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, not just any plants, hon! Trees! Big gnarled oaks and things. Some of them live hundreds of years! Way up there as mortals go. You take good care of it like that, maybe it'll grow to be something special for you, too!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hey, this is sort of a weird question, but... this Evergreen Acorn, it's not... related to you, is it? Since, you know, you're... partly oak, aren't you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah, I'm part oak, that's right. But maybe not the part you're thinking of, I mean, you think I would just hand you one of my babies or something? Hahahaha, that's disgusting!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Hold on, hon, is that... huh! Almost felt like Orpheus was with you there. Would you listen to me? Must have been singing too many high notes, or something.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"No, wait, you're onto something... I think you must have sensed Orpheus' Distant Memory! He gave it to me as a keepsake of our friendship. Though, something like this... I feel like it should belong to you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, that's him in there all right! See, I never should have second-guessed myself. Well, you hang onto that, as I've got plenty memories of him already, thanks!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Oh, hon, you look awful. What did you get yourself into? Here, one of these should make you feel a little better.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Oh, you look like you've been through a lot, Hades kid. Maybe a decent bite to eat will help!",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
"Oof, you're a mess, there, hon. You save your strength and see if this will do you any good.",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female

You just be sure to tell that good-for-nothing Orpheus I'm looking good.,CHARACTER,Eurydice,female

"Bet you Orpheus hasn't had any strokes of musical genius lately, now, has he?",CHARACTER,Eurydice,female
Better not be Orpheus putting you up to visiting here all the time like this.,CHARACTER,Eurydice,female

"Really, you're... heh... kicking me out? Why?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Fates are cruel, Zagreus. You're bound to that place... same as your father. So they would have us say good-bye, for now. My heart soars, knowing you live. Then it breaks, that our time together was so brief.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"No... I can... come back... I can come back, now that I found you, he... maybe he'll just let me come back.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You tell him I demand it. And I demand he also tell me how come he, or for that matter Nyx, never sent notice that you lived! Olympus is all rife with schemers, but I was so naive to think that they were different.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll tell him... I'll tell him, I... feel awful. I... I have to go.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Until we... ungh.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No... not... yet...,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
"I begged the Fates that you'd return to me. Perhaps I ought to be more careful how I speak of them. Tell me, how was your journey? What happened?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Father didn't make it any easier for me. Nor would he tell me why he never sent for you, after you left. So, I don't know, what's going on, still, but... I wanted to see you, again.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I wanted to see you, too. Come, speak quickly with me, that our time together here may be as full as possible, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I just... I need to know what happened, between you and Father. Why are you here, and not with us?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I couldn't live with myself anymore, down there. After I left Olympus, a long story in itself, I came to be with your father, in the Underworld. It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but... I never felt that I belonged.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I know the feeling, I think. But you stayed. Long enough to have me. Those whom I've spoken to about you, it's as you said, they have fond memories of you. And then, you even had a child. Did Father... did he mistreat you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, no. Your father could be very difficult. Though, he was gentle, with me. Soon enough, we got on fine, better than fine, at times, but... when I was with child... why, I struggled terribly. Because... a child born of surface-dwellers could not live, down there.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Could not live down there, according to whom, exactly? The Fates?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"According to them, yes. According to your father, and to Nyx. Even having heard... I took my chances, anyway. But when you emerged stillborn... it was too much. I fled. I fled, and came to reside here. Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Urgh... but... why would Father lie to you? If he never wanted you... or never wanted me... surely he had the means.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I don't know. I'm wondering the same. But, oh, look at you, Zagreus! We're running out of time. It's happening again! Stay with me, please?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...I'm trying... but I can't... stay that much longer... I don't think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, my dear son! Then please... ask Hades what you asked of me! Why he would lie? Tell him I must know, the same as you. And you farewell. Until we meet again!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
It's just... a hunch... of mine...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll... be... back...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Mother, I... discovered how come Father led you to believe that I could not survive past birth. He didn't lie to you, exactly. So he says.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Wait, slow down, Zagreus, what do you mean? He told me you would not survive your birth, yet here you are. How wasn't that a lie?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Because... he thought it was the truth. The Fates appointed him dominion over the entire Underworld. But he would never have an heir, so he was led to understand. He never expected me to be born, much less survive.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He never expected you to survive? Then, forgive my asking, but... why did you? How did you? The Fates are not known for making mistakes when it comes to such things.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Nyx saved my life. Or gave me life, I guess. Then raised me in your absence. The Fates are her daughters, right? Maybe she persuaded them to go easier on me. She cannot say more. In any case, apparently it took her quite a while to revive me, and... by then, you were gone.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx... of course she was involved. I only managed to escape because of her. Then, she restored my stillborn son to life, and nurtured him? And, I never would have known, unless that child, fully grown and having learned the truth, defied his father, and then found me here?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Yes. Although, we still don't know how come Father and Nyx never sent for you. Though, ungh, let me ask you something, Mother, if you please. If you had found out... that I was born, and very much alive... would you have come back?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Would I have come back... to see my only child? Had I but known you lived... I would have gladly gone through hell again to see you, Zagreus. Of course I would have.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Shocked,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Well then... what if... urgh... what if Father... didn't want you... doing that?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What if he didn't want me coming back to him? Or seeing you? Oh no, you're fading again, Zagreus. You've pushed yourself too hard! But what is it you meant, by what you said?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I... I won't be long...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Urgh... mmm... ungh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So good to see you, again, Zagreus. Since last you left, I couldn't help but think the worst, about what happened after I had left... or soon before. You mentioned Nyx... you don't suppose that she and Hades... wanted me out of the way?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I just... don't think that can be. Though, let me ask you. How long did you know Father? And Nyx, for that matter? Did they seem trustworthy?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes. I knew them long enough to have decided yes, that they were trustworthy. As much as anyone I've ever met. But I also know never to be trusting to a fault. I have to consider the possibility I was deceived.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Especially since neither of them is being forthcoming with me even now, right? And yet, I have this feeling something else is going on, Mother. The way that Father speaks of you, the way Nyx speaks of you... I think... they care for you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, hahaha! Well, they have a funny way of showing it, I think. Your father, so... you have to get through him each time you visit me?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I do. Mother, what if... what if Father thinks that he's protecting you? Have you... considered that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Protecting me? Why Zagreus, what do you mean by that? As you can see, I can fend for myself.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well... urgh... you're from Olympus, aren't you? But... the gods, none of them seem to know... you're here... so...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What, how would you know something like that? Zagreus? Ah, curse the Fates, you're leaving me again...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
When I... return...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Khh... uhhh... urgh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Son, I have to ask you, how much do you know about your relatives upon Olympus?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I think I know quite a bit by now. I've been in steady contact with Athena, Zeus, and other members of the family ever since I first left Father's House... they've been assisting me in getting here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No... Zagreus, what have you done? You've led them here?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, no, they think... they think I'm trying to escape from Father so that I can join them on their mountaintop. At least I think that's what they think. Most of them, anyway.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
But then... does Hades know of this? That Olympus is involved?,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"He does. Both he and Nyx. In fact, it's Nyx who put me and Olympus into contact. I could never have broken free of the Underworld if not for their help.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So Nyx and Hades are against each other, then. And Olympus is helping you... but they don't know I'm here, as far as you're aware?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"That's right. More or less. Nyx and Father seem to put up with each other. Don't seem to have much of a choice. Though, ever since I learned of you, Nyx has been helping me to find you... while Father's tried to stop me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That fool... what was he thinking? What is he thinking...? Do you suppose... he thinks that he's protecting me from them? Oh, no...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I... urgh... I think maybe he does think so, indeed... because, now having met my relatives upon Olympus, I... can definitely see that they can be a bit... vindictive about things.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Vindictiveness runs in the family, my son. Then, if Olympus is involved, that would explain a lot. I'm here, not there with them, as you can see. But, oh, it seems we'll have to speak some more, when next you return...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
When I... return...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Khh... uhhh... urgh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Son, I have to ask you, how much do you know about your relatives upon Olympus?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"A little. I've been in contact with Athena, Zeus, and other members of the family ever since I first left Father's House... they've been assisting me in getting here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No... Zagreus, what have you done? You've led them here?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female

No... what have I done...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Grr... I... can't...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I could not stand it on Olympus, Zagreus. The blustering, the posturing... my overbearing mother... none of it. I would have left the mountain voluntarily, except...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"...Except Father absconded with you, didn't he? Dragged you down with him into the Underworld. So if Olympus were to find that out... I shudder to think of the consequences.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That fool is trying to protect me even now. It wasn't he who absconded with me, my son. And it's more complicated even than that. I was content to leave. Willing to make my life within the Underworld. With your father.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I dare not ask who did bring you to Father, then. So, essentially, you ran away from home, to live with him? I mean no disrespect, but... did you realize what you were getting yourself into?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We have a tendency to be impetuous when we are younger, Zagreus. I'd heard all about your father before we met. Admired paintings of him. It was very awkward, at first. But he had a bluntness I fancied. A sense of principle. I much preferred him to his brothers, I can tell you that.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"So, urgh... then you secretly left Mount Olympus to be with the god of the dead in the Underworld. And Olympus never found out. What do you suppose would happen... if they did?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...I think... there would be war between Olympus and your father, Zagreus, if they found out. Especially now. After all this. And after all this time. They slew their parents once. If the Titans could be wiped from this world, so can we all.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"So it makes sense... if Father, he agrees with you, and thinks... that leaving you in hiding here, that it's the only way... he can prevent that war...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I can see how your father, shrewd but also single-minded as he was, might have followed such a line of reasoning as that. Oh, Zagreus... what have I done?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Mother... I... blast...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Goodbye...!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Zagreus... it's wonderful to see you, but... I need to ask something of you. That you not visit me again, here in this place. Both for your safety, and for mine.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Wait, what? Because of what would happen if the Olympians found out? So, after everything, you're taking Father's side in all of this?!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
I am. Your father is no fool when it comes to matters such as this. Besides... all that has happened... it's my fault. I was selfish! And now both sides of our family threaten to be torn apart.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Your fault? So let's say you never left Olympus! Then it'd be just like you thought, until quite recently, I think. That I'd never existed! Besides, they haven't found out any of this. What makes you so sure they will, all the sudden?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx may be veiling you from them as she veiled me when I fled here myself. But even her own powers aren't infallible. Each time you visit me, you are incurring risk. One small slip, and they shall find me. Discover your deception. Go home, Zagreus. Please.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Go home with me, Mother! You came here under false pretenses. I haven't fought all this way, over and over again, only to turn back now. I need you in my life! How can you just... turn me away like this?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Zagreus... I cannot return. After all that happened between Hades and me, and everyone, I just cannot fathom the idea. Besides... the risks we're taking would be even greater if Olympus were to find me there, with him. And you.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Then... ungh... you're just... going to stay here? Alone, in the middle of nowhere, in this little garden... forever? After we part ways, just like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"My son... I know you've made hard choices and sacrifices to be here with me. And I'm forever grateful to have finally met you. But this is my home, now, yes. While your home is below. Please, if not for your sake, then for mine... do not return. I love you, Zagreus. Good-bye.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
We... have to...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No... not... yet...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You can't do this to me, Mother. You said Father is no fool, and neither are you. There has to be a way to fix this. Not just with you and Father, but with everyone. There has to be a way!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

...You have your father's stubbornness. Listen to me. You're endangering everything you care about by coming here. Don't you understand? Besides...,CHARACTER,Persephone,female

"...The truth is that I like it here, Zagreus. I have done well for myself on my own. And your father, he has his domain to look after. The feelings he once had for me... feelings we shared... they fade, with time. You'll understand, someday.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"No! I won't be understanding anything of the sort. Father still loves you. I'm sure of it! And, he owes you an apology, damn it! I cannot make amends with you on his behalf. It's something only you can do together.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"What do you mean he still loves me, Zagreus...? How would you know?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Because... ungh... I'm his blasted son, that's how I know! But trust me isn't ever good enough, I know that, too. I'll prove it to you, Mother! Just you wait and see.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInjured_IdleToSick,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're fading, Son... you don't need to prove anything to me. Please don't do anything rash. All of us made our choices. Now we have to live with them. Isn't it enough, to know that I am safe? That I'm content to be alone?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Shocked,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No... urgh... it's not... it's not enough, for me, because... this blasted family... it cannot just keep hiding from its problems! Running from them! We're stuck with one another, we... we have to do everything we can... for one another!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I... oh, my dear boy...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
But... you are... the Queen...!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mmph... rrkh... ungh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...Of everything down in that gloomy House, I miss old Cerberus the most, I think. But, I miss other things as well. The lack of light was gentler on my skin. Not being as cold. And Nyx, and her young sons. It was all very odd, but...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Mother... in Father's bedchambers... mind you, there's almost nothing there, just neatly sorted rows of all his samey capes... but on his nightstand... is a portrait of you. Wearing a regal crown of red laurels. A Queen. His Queen.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was fitted for those garments when I first arrived. They... were not my customary style. So Hades has a portrait of me, still. Why would he put it back on display, now?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"No, no, he's never let anybody in his bedchambers! I broke in. Don't you see? He didn't put your portrait back on display. It's always been there! Ever since you left. So, Mother, why do you suppose he would do that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Because he... because he loves me still. Is that what you want me to say?,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Have you ever loved him, yourself?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"All I really wanted was to leave Olympus. I didn't exactly abscond. I doubt I had much of a choice, but I went willingly. Perhaps Zeus knew how I felt, and thought he was doing me a favor. As for Hades... I grew to love him, yes. He always gave me my space.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Won't you... urgh... won't you please talk to him? Or visit Cerberus again, or Nyx? As for Olympus... surely all of you... can figure something out...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

PersephoneGarden_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Make what a surprise?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
My arrival. I'm going. To your home. To Cerberus. Nyx. Your father.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"You're... really?! Mother, you, you're serious?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I am. Now if you could just help me pack up my remaining things? Only a few loose odds I'm bringing, just in case. If we hurry, maybe you could join me, rather than return the customary way. Not something a mother ever wants to see.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Join you, but... wait, how are you going to get back? I... hadn't thought that far ahead.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Load Return01,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You're on the River Styx. No longer in the mortal realm, entirely.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I can't believe that this is happening.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I know. My heart is racing. Nothing like a river journey to remind oneself that there's no turning back.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Seriously. Though, even after all of this... it's like we only just met. I have so many questions for you still.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"We'll have plenty of time for them, I think! For now, best we keep quiet. Pretend we're just a couple of dead souls on their final voyage.,",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"This is embarrassing, but... I don't know the way to get back in. Except, you know, the customary way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That's quite all right; I do. In the name of Persephone, the Queen!! Open the gates!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneGarden_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Indeed.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"How has it been for you so far, Mother? Reacclimating to all this. You said before it was a struggle. Must be very strange, being back. Being in darkness all the time.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, I think it's gone all right so far! Thank you for asking, Son. Everyone has been quite welcoming. The darkness is a pleasant change of pace, and while this dress can be a little difficult to move in... I quite like it.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That's good to hear. I have to admit I was a little worried you'd be desperate to return to your cottage by now. This place can be a little much.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sure it can. And I do miss my little cottage here and there, but... I think I'm through running away. There may be times when it is necessary, of course. But no matter how far you run, it doesn't make your problems go away. You taught me that, you know.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I did? But... I tried desperately to run away, myself.... Oh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Never! Kidding. Of course.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Turns out there's still an awful lot to do around here, isn't there, Zagreus? I'm still getting caught up on day-to-day affairs.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Day-to-day, how can you even tell it's day around here, anyway, Mother?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well that was just a guess, now that you mention it. In any case, forgive me if I don't get swooped up in every household detail, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I like them, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, Mother, all the pomegranates around here... those are your doing?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not a lot of fruit trees take to this environment, my son. Though, there's something about pomegranates! Maybe it's that their seeds so resemble the gemstones your father likes so much. Or that they don't need much water.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Fruit trees, huh. I grew up around all these poms and never thought much of it. Are there many other types of fruit trees on the surface, then?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Well... I suppose there are a few. But I like pomegranates most of all.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Sounds good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This garden isn't quite the sight yours was back on the surface, is it, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"On the contrary, Zagreus! It has its own unique charm. As each garden does. I was impressed it wasn't left entirely to rot after my absence.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
It was totally off limits to me. Though I guess Father must have taken care to maintain it as best he could.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He did, all right. Minus the part where you weren't allowed. Though, let's look after it from here, shall we?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Still can't believe he let me hold his spear.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You know, that painting in Father's... I mean your bedchambers, it turned out rather well, didn't it? Some very talented shades around here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, it's beautiful! I tried to persuade your father to hang it out in the hall but he's too coy about such things. Though, I like it where it is... a reminder to us, every day and night.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"<Inhale> And it smells fresh, too!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This garden may not have all the varieties available up on the surface... though it's coming along rather nicely, I should say!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Cheers, I'm glad you like it!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It's lovely what you've done to this place, Zagreus! It's looking better than ever, thank you.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I will. Thank you, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Were you able to make it to my cottage on the surface, Zagreus? I hope my lavender patches are doing all right.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I, erm... I couldn't make it all the way there, Mother. It's like... without your presence on the surface, I'm unable to hang on for very long at all.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, I was afraid of that. Well, don't despair. I placed a charm upon my seedlings there that ought to keep them flourishing well on their own. Your duty now is simply to escape. You keep it up!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Sometimes I think he tried.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Tell me something, Zagreus... sometimes I fear... do you hate him? I mean your father. Regardless of his intentions... it sounds as though he made your life extraordinarily difficult. All his pent-up fear and anger... you bore the brunt of it.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Do I hate him...? Mother, I don't know that I hate anybody, really. The tales of him and the Olympians rending their immortal Titan parents to bits... I can't relate to how they must have felt. But, I resented him, for sure. And... I don't know if I'll ever get over that, entirely.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I understand. I think that when Hades told you he asked no forgiveness, he understood as well, and meant it. Well, for all his failings, I'm thankful that he did not teach you how to hate. For your own sake, if not for his.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Yes. I'm glad for you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So, how has it been between you and your father lately, Zagreus? I know the two of you have lots of work ahead of you. Especially him.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Well, it's been all right, I guess. I think he's set in some of his ways. But at least we have some sort of understanding now. Even if he acts like everything is still the same when I'm out there on the job.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He says it's so you put forth your fullest effort every time. All this is a big adjustment for him as well. Not that it's any excuse for how he's treated you. Are you... all right, seeing us together?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Hahaha, no. You're plenty.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Erm, so are things with you and Father... everything all right, so far?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Things are good, Zagreus. I'm from Olympus... all the relationships I've ever known have been the complicated sort. But with your father... despite our different dispositions and interests... beneath it all, we share a simple understanding.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
And... what understanding is that? If you can share.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
That we're all we've got. And that we love each other. Through thick and thin.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Wait, you're not... you're not thinking about having more children, are you...?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm sure she did.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx has a very steady presence, doesn't she? I want to say she hasn't changed a bit since before you were born, but... I know that she's been through a lot.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"She's always managed, and quite gracefully at that. Never seen her break a sweat over anything. Even when I confronted her about you. Though, you two seem closer than I realized, I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, your father isn't always the conversationalist, and Nyx... she was the first chthonic god I ever met. I suppose she welcomed having another lady about the House.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Hahaha, it's a deal.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Zagreus... how am I doing? As a mother. Tell me honestly. Nyx has had so much to share about raising you. Foods you hated or enjoyed, your natural abilities, your friendships... she knows everything! Sometimes I wonder how I can ever compete?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Mother, I think you're doing great. And I'm sure you know it's not a competition between you and Nyx. I just get the benefit of having two great mothers rather than one. Or zero.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thank you, my son. I know I wasn't there for most of the hard part, but... I'm here, now. Though, when I inevitably, inadvertently trample all over your feelings at some point, please tell me, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"No idea what a calling card is, but, OK!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Mother, one thing I was wondering about was, how did you summon Charon to your surface residence? Especially without, you know, being dead.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, why... he gave me his calling card after he graciously helped get me out of here the first time. No doubt at Nyx's request, but still. Never thought I'd use it, but... I still kept it. Just in case.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
At least we've some of that in us.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Indeed, my son.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Mother, you'll forgive my asking, but... your mother used to call you by a different name, didn't she?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, don't remind me. Imagine if I called you Zaggie-poo from when you were born to this very moment, that's how that name felt to me. I much preferred the name my father gave to me.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Your mortal father, right...? So he called you Persephone. What was he like?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"He was kind to me. And funny! Little bringer of destruction, I was to him. I liked that. He was right, I was a terror. But then he passed. I was very little still. My mother never spoke of him again.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Demeter mentioned him a bit to me. She seems... I don't know, but I don't sense that she regrets the relationship or anything. Just sad about the outcome I think.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I suppose I can see that. I thought I might end up like Father... growing old, wasting away. Then the time flew by, and I realized I was closer to Mother's side. Mortals certainly don't have it easy. But their limited days, it means... they live their lives to the fullest, I think.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"We can, and shall.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Mother, just how long has it been snowing on the surface, do you know? Because, it seems to me that Demeter... Grandmother, I should say, she... well, it's been very cold up there each time I've been.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was afraid of that... I wanted to believe the snow about my cottage, it was native to the climate there, but... seems that Mother took my absence harder than I thought. Oh, what have I done. All those poor people.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. And we can fix this, right?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Least I could do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx told me that you helped her reconnect with her parent... after a long, long time. That was very kind of you. She never asks for anything. But we all owe her a lot, don't we?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I think so. If not for her... I can't even imagine, really. Did Nyx ever speak to you of Chaos, before I was born?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Not really, no. Nyx is very private when it comes to personal matters. But she has feelings and desires same as anybody. Well, mostly, but the point is... I know this meant a lot to her.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Thank you. He more than deserved it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It seems Achilles had a complicated arrangement with your father. I understand you simplified things for the better, there, and he was able to visit Elysium at last. Well done.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I'd no idea.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"So Orpheus was finally able to reunite with Eurydice because of you, my son? Ah, I'm so glad! Your father's arrangement with him was quite severe. Though he did ask for a lot, for a mortal soul to return to the land of the living...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Is it even possible, for Father to return a mortal back to life if he so chose? Just by letting their shade escape, or something?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, I've no idea, probably not? But we were so moved by Orpheus' plea and song, that, well... I think your father took pity on him.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Wait, we were so moved? You were there when Orpheus came to try and rescue Eurydice?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I was. Your father knew I loved their music. Imagine my surprise to see him as our court musician, here!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They are. Thank you, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I always fancied Thanatos, you know. So put together and everything! I'm pleased to see you've grown so close. Things good between you two?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"She does. She's great, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"That Dusa sure has quite the uplifting presence around here, doesn't she, Zagreus? Sometimes I see you chatting and it warms my heart.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Urgh... yeah....,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Zagreus, I know you're upset about what happened between Nyx and Dusa. Before you ask... I need to respect Nyx's space and authority on this one, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Most definitely, yes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I saw that Dusa had returned. I trust Nyx's judgment, though I must admit I was pleased to see she decided to give her another chance.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I know what you mean. I'll let you know when it's done.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All right. We've matters with Olympus to resolve. They don't know I'm here, most of them, besides Zeus, maybe Athena. They think you're Nyx's son rather than mine, and that your goal is still to join them on their mountaintop.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"What a mess. What can we do? The gods of Olympus have all been very good to me, for the most part. I don't feel great about deceiving them. They keep trying to help me escape!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What can we do? We can make peace with them. And let them know the truth. So much of it as they would tolerate. Diplomacy is not your father's strong suit. But I am going to need you two to do exactly as I say. Do you understand?,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, Mother. So what do you intend to do, and how do I fit in?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We're going to invite all of them to a little family gathering! Here. And you shall personally deliver them their invitations, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Mother, are you serious? So, we're just going to have a bash with them, and they'll just see you after all this time, and be fine with everything?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"They certainly shall not be fine with everything. But, Hades and I, we'll be prepared to tell them what they need to hear. Don't worry, I shall do the talking.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
What are you going to say?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father...",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathy_Return,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Your mother won't be happy that you left.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"What? No, I never knew that.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Neither do they.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
How soon is this family gathering you have in mind going to take place?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Soon after you invite them all, I hope. Now, go. And trust in me, all right? We have a lot to learn of trust, I think.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"You got it, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How goes the doling out of invitations, Zagreus? Have the Olympians been amenable to the idea?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Not just amenable, Mother. Positively intrigued. I can't believe you scrambled the invitations in such a way that, only with the lot of them combined will they get all of the details!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"A bit of collaboration seemed in the spirit of things. We're a great, big family, Zagreus. Past time we started acting like one, no? Now, keep it up. And thank you for your help.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Mm-hm!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Mother, this family gathering you're planning... are all our relatives welcome? Because I was wondering if I could extend the invitation to a distant ancestor... you know... Chaos.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx's parent... you've been in contact, then? Look, if you feel it's the right thing to do, I trust your judgment. The spirit of this event is to bring the family together.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Thanks. I doubt Chaos would be able to attend, though would still appreciate the thought.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Sounds good. I'll see you then.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"It's done, Mother! Father. The invitations. Personally sent to everyone with whom I've been in contact. So, what do we do now?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Excellent, Zagreus! Congratulate him, Hades! On a job well done.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Grr. Persephone, how can you be so certain your request was executed to your satisfaction?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It's known as trust, Hades. Or faith? They're similar. Try one, sometime! It'll be good for you. As for what we do next... why, we've a great, big feast we must prepare!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This House is not a suitable location for such guests! Dionysus, alone, shall bring ruin to this place! Or... urgh... the faith thing that you said.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Hades_HouseFistSlam,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yes, good! Now then... we have a lot of work to go around, so why don't we call everyone on staff, and let them in on this, and dole out suitable responsibilities, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
All right....,CHARACTER,Hades,male
All right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
All right!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
...Whew! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"And Uncle Zeus is glad things didn't turn out worse for him. I get the sense he acts a bit impulsively at times, and deals with the consequences later.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"What can I tell you, Zagreus? We're family. You said it yourself to me before: We're stuck with one another. That any of us like each other in the slightest... it's a wonder and a blessing, I think.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Yeah. I know what you mean. Thanks, Mother. Think I'll be heading out again soon. See you when I get back?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm going to miss you too, Son.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I have to say, Mother, that was a clever plan. Convincing Father to finally let somebody have some fun around here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Haha, well! I'm glad it worked out for the best. There's just one thing that happened that I ought to tell you about, Son. No secrets between us, and all. This... is quite difficult for me to say.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"It's about Demeter, isn't it. You two were talking half the night. She wants you to come home with her, doesn't she? You'll always be her little one, something like that?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Indeed... something like that. You're quite perceptive, have I ever told you, Zagreus? But yes, my mother, she was quite conflicted. Didn't know whether to smite me or to hold me, maybe both. And, yes. She asked that I come home... to my responsibilities.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"So... you're leaving...? No, Mother, you can't be leaving, you just got here!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenial_Full,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, it's not as bad as that, it's just... if we are to keep the peace down here, then, I must spend some time up there. Every so often! But, I shall always return, in no time at all. I promised Hades, and I promise you.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Well then... when are you going to go?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Soon, Zagreus. Perhaps by the time you're back.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I don't suppose... I can come with you, can I?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusInteractionThoughtful,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Tsk, you know the surface isn't good for you! Besides, you're needed here. But, if you really want to see it for yourself, someday, who knows? Perhaps eventually we'll figure out a way.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I'm going to miss you, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
At least she forgave.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Welcome home, Mother! How was your trip, things go all right with you and Demeter? With... Grandmother. Still getting used to thinking of her that way.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, it's funny... I think she was so overwhelmed to see me again that maybe something finally changed in her. I always thought she was utterly unyielding. She asked me if I truly came here by choice, and I put her at ease.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Ah, that's a relief. Grandmother can be rather intense, but... she's been kind to me, and very helpful, too. Do you suppose she'll ease up on the whole eternal winter thing there on the surface, now that she knows you're safe?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I asked. She told me that she would. Warmth shall return to the surface. Some of the time, at least. Likely on a rigid schedule, knowing her. And perhaps not in the vicinity of our domain. She's not the sort to forgive and simply forget.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Well, we need them.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"...Oh, come on, Hades! Mortals are much more resilient than that! What, you think they'll show up at your gates here, all at once? They have our family looking out for them.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"That is what I'm afraid of. Do you truly believe my brothers and the rest shall take the sort of care of them while they draw breath, as we do here after they have expired?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"It's true we have to look out for them indefinitely, while Olympus need only look out for them for a little while. But our relatives are always watching from their mountain! And if they do turn a blind eye once in a while... mortals aren't bad at fending for themselves.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"But they are never satisfied! Always begging us to provide more, and more.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"They like us, Hades! They praise us, tell one another about us. What do you expect? Would you rather they forgot about us?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...No. No, I suppose not. But they need us!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
...He has.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
...And what of the complaints from Elysium? They wanted the lawns thoroughly manicured for their athletic contests.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Already taken care of. Though, the flooding in Asphodel, hm, that doesn't look like something we can clear up for quite some time. Fortunately, the residents seem to be getting accustomed to it.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Dismiss,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"There have been fewer reports about it as of late. And what of the Satyr problem? Blasted things are rampant up there, still.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Well, they're probably contained up there, at least. And Zagreus has been keeping them in check, hasn't he?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Our best... that I can promise you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Well, be that as it may... if they pester you at all, do let me know, and I shall have them dealt with quickly.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Oh, Hades... I think the shades around here have been through enough as it is! I don't mind them. After all the time I spent on my own, having some company has been a welcome change.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
You are certain all your needs have been provided for? Because if there is anything that you require...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Require? Look at this place, Hades. Look at me! I have everything! And so do you. Try not to worry quite so much. And be patient with your son. That's all I ask.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Persephone, I cannot promise you such things, they're... not my strengths. Besides, I have a reputation to uphold! God of the dead! If the wretches do not fear me, or you for that matter... what, then?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I'm not going to tell you how to balance your work, your marriage, and your parental responsibilities. I don't think anybody on Olympus or below knows quite how best to manage that. So long as we do our best.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Indeed.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"...Sometimes, I... still cannot believe that you are here. Returned to us. Your radiance, in all this darkness... you must miss seeing the coast.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The coast was nice enough, Hades. But nothing is ever perfect, right? No matter how hard you try. Still... I think we get quite close around here, every once in a while.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You have taken much less time adjusting to this place than when first you joined us. Part of my surprise. I, myself, was forced to be here. I never thought anyone would come from the surface here by choice.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The heart can make us do the strangest things, can't it?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Mmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...So if there's anything that I can do for you, Nyx, you need but ask, all right? I plan to pull my weight.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Your services were always welcome, here. Please acclimate yourself at your own rate. I am available to answer any questions you may have at any time.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thank you, my friend. I have to tell you... it's good to be back.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Precisely, yes.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"...I just don't know how I can ever repay you. For raising him. For everything. After I left... besides old Cerberus, I think maybe I missed you most of all.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I can remember feeling similar emotions at the time. However, it is quite unnecessary to give thanks to me this way. You are the Queen, safely returned where you belong. I did what anybody would have in my place.",CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Anybody would have lovingly raised my estranged son, while keeping safe my secret, eventually orchestrating an elaborate plot to reunite him with me, so that I might someday return, to have a Nectar with them in the lounge?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Cerberus! Doubtless you deserve the biggest thanks that this House still stands, don't you? Did you enjoy the treat I brought you from the surface?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
The surface-treat-devouring hound of hell provides the Queen a most decidedly affirmative response.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"I thought you might. You wouldn't know it wasn't made of meat, I'll bet! I'll see if we can't grow you plenty more.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"You're such a good boy, aren't you, Cerberus? Yes you are! Guarded the place while I was out. And even let my son come visit me!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Vulnerable,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
The ever-vigilant and terrifying Cerberus merely accepts the praise.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"I'm sorry, Zagreus, I've pressing matters to attend to now.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Do let me know if I can help with anything, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Your father's prouder of you than you think.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Go make us proud, my son.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Keeping the realm secure as ever, right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
It's always nice to have a chat with you.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I think the House is well enough in order as of late.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I hope your last assignment turned out well.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Do give yourself a break from time to time!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I ever tell you you're the best son that a mother's ever had?,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Hope my little cottage on the coast is holding up!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Please keep an eye on my garden on the surface when you get a chance.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I'd say this garden's doing quite all right for now.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Don't let your father get to you too much, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"You're looking just as well as ever, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"You show your father who's in charge next chance you get, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"The pomegranate trees are coming in nicely still, the tough old things.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
You'll let me know if there's something that I can do for you?,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"We have to say farewell again, for now, my son. Olympus calls, but I'll be back, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I shall be leaving again for Olympus soon. I'll miss you, Son.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I must go visit Mother on Olympus, Zagreus. I'll tell her you said hi.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I have to go again, soon, Zagreus, all right? I'll see you soon.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I'm due to visit Mount Olympus once again, so please be good to one another while I'm out.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Time that I headed up to Mount Olympus, though you keep an eye on things till I get back?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I have to go now, Zagreus, but I shall see you just as soon as I return.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Things are well enough upon Olympus. Though, it's a relief to have come home again.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Don't think I'll ever get fully accustomed to Olympus, Son.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Zagreus, you're the most welcome sight I've seen in quite some time.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Always such an exhausting journey, from Olympus down to here.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
I trust that you and Hades have been good to one another since I left?,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I'll tell you, it is so much colder up there on that mountaintop.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
This is a welcome sight from all the snow-capped mountaintops.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
<Smirk>,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh we're busy just formulating more of our dark schemes together, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Mmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
NyxIdleGreeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nyx here is a wellspring of parental advice, as it turns out!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Mmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
"Nyx was just telling me some more about your early days, my son.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Hmm.,CHARACTER,Nyx,female
It seems I failed once again to persuade Nyx to take some personal time!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Please excuse your father and me for the moment, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Go on, Hades. Try saying something nice to him, for once.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Grr....,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Your father and I still have a bit of work here to wrap up.,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Indeed.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The work certainly never ceases, Zagreus!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
<Scoffing>,CHARACTER,Hades,male
More than enough parchmentwork to go around!,CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Euugghh...,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Plenty of parchmentwork to contend with, I can assure you, Zagreus!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Don't go too hard on each other out there, all right?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I've heard that you've been doing great out there lately, Zagreus.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Erm, Mother? Was it always a custom in Father's House to secretly give Nectar to those you care about? I guess it also could have been a thing on Olympus. Look, I wanted you to have this. I'm so glad I found you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, Zagreus, you're so thoughtful, truly! Your father never permitted Nectar out in the open so I'd practically forgotten its savor. Though, just a moment, I have something for you, too!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"For me? Are you quite sure? You know, this vintage must have made it all the way up from the surface, to the mountains, then to here. We've both had distant journeys, haven't we?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Well, I, for one, am certain this vintage here has journeyed to the right place. Please enjoy it.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I must confess I do enjoy having a good bottle of Nectar, every now and then. And you appear to have a careful eye for such bottles, from what I can tell!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"My careful eye has got to be the green one, hasn't it. To having a discerning eye, Mother!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thank you very much, my son! You know, gift-giving customs of the Underworld are just so much more straightforward than the complicated social graces of Olympus!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"If there are other ways of showing one's appreciation than with Nectar and the like, well, they must pale in comparison I'm sure!",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, this is wonderful, except... I'm wracked with guilt for having nothing much to give you, in return. You never even got a mother's love from me.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Please don't say that, it's just a gift, all right? Besides... can't we start now? Mother and son type things. If you would like.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'd like that even more than this fine Nectar, Zagreus!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
Perhaps I am part plant!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Somebody raised you very well indeed, my son. Nyx, I suppose. I'll never be half the mother she is. She's done it for aeons! While I'm only getting started.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"For what it's worth, I happen to think you're off to an excellent start. Nyx did teach me a lot. Achilles, too, and Father, in a way. But there is no replacing your presence. I felt that before we ever met. And now I know for sure.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Thank you, Zagreus. Let's hope you're right. I nurtured very many plants, at least, of that I can assure you! Perhaps my gardening experience provided a bit of a head start on this whole mothering thing.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"You're very welcome, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Mother, I know there may not be many things you miss from living on Olympus, though I wondered if perhaps Ambrosia may be one of them. And got you some, because... well, here.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"...Why, this really is Ambrosia! How did you even acquire this, Zagreus? It brings back memories, for certain. And, never the bad ones, which... I think it must be why we prize this stuff so much. This is for me?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"It is, it is, of course! And, it's my dearest hope that, at some point long from now, when you're relaxing with a bottle of Ambrosia, dare I say perhaps with Father... that these memories will be among the ones that spring to mind.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Oh, my son... I shall certainly not need Ambrosia to think back upon getting to know you with the greatest fondness. Thank you very much.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Here, Mother. More bottled pleasant memories for you. I know you're glad you've long since left Olympus, but... I'm glad you were there, because the experience of it must have played no small part in making you who you are.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"You know, the last bottle you gave me brought more pleasant memories than I expected. No telling just how many more of them I've tucked away. Say, would it be all right if I shared this with your father?",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
It is yours to do with as you please.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Haha, almost sounded like a no to me!",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"No! I mean, yes, please share it with Father, if he would be willing... I imagine what few pleasant memories he has are all of you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Nonsense, there's also Cerberus! Present company excluded. Come on, Son. Your father has a lot of work to do, but I'm absolutely certain that he has fond memories of you. Though, I know that isn't reassuring, coming from me.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Everything is somehow reassuring, coming from you, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I thought about it more, Mother, and I would like very much if you and Father were to share this. Though, maybe don't let on where you got it, just in case?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"This is splendid, Zagreus, but please! If there's one thing I've learned since we met, it's that the trust we share is at the very foundation of our relationships. Why shouldn't he know who this is from? Besides, I think he could figure it out.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
PersephoneUnderworld_Greeting,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"Well, when it came to the Olympians, you said yourself that there was only so much truth that they could tolerate. Are you sure Father would be tolerant knowing I got this for the both of you?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkDenialStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
"I'm sure enough! And if he isn't, I suppose it's more for me.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"Haha, well! Just as long as someone puts it to good use.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"...You know I always wanted to be a mother, Zagreus? But after you were born... I was certain I had lost my chance. Then one fine morning you just walked into my life. And here we are. I still cannot entirely believe it. What I mean is... I love you, Son. I'm doing my best.",CHARACTER,Persephone,female
"I know. I love you, too, Mother.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
ZagreusTalkEmpathyStart,CHARACTER,_preLineAnim,unknown
Mother must still be on Olympus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mother's up on some mountaintop.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mother's away I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

Cerberus can never get enough of this stuff.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

That must be one of those Infernal Troves!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That is an ominous-looking portal on the ground right there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What is that portal thing there on the ground?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I need a higher Pain Level with the Pact of Punishment to go in this.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale

Master Chaos! I've returned.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The heart of the Underworld.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm back here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The deepest reaches of the Underworld... the void from which all life and consciousness sprang forth during the dawn of time... the realm of Chaos. A land almost unseen even to denizens of death's kingdom.,CHARACTER,Storyteller,male

The Satyrs must be fashioning those things...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It's quiet, finally...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male

"I'm back, huh.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Need to keep looking down those passageways.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got to find something for Cerberus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got to keep searching.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A moment's rest.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh no. Not this.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Cerberus is back on duty. Got to find him something to eat.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Time to feed the beast.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
There's Cerberus. Won't budge till I find him a treat.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Time to find old Cerberus a Satyr sack.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Won't get out of here until I find something for Cerberus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Cerberus guarding the gates as always.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Time to clear some Satyr tunnels and get out of here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Now to get Cerberus to step aside.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The vast Temple of Styx and its innumerable dangers now are all that separate the Underworld Prince from the land outside, which he so desperately longs to see.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Not far from here, the dead begin their journey to their final resting-place down in the depths below; and so the river-boatman Charon often passes through.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The widely-feared and many-headed Cerberus, the Underworld's sentinel, presides over the entrance to this realm, devouring whole those fool enough to make attempts to flee.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"A crudely-hewn network of tunnels grows from one of the cold Temple's flanks, containing vicious denizens unwelcome in this realm, even in death.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
<Cough> Ungh...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"<Cough> Ugh, I... cold...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I made it...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Beyond the frozen overlook... await the first glimpse of the sun to your left... then onward through the cold.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Sure hope this works, Nyx.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Beyond the frozen overlook... await the first glimpse of the sun to your left... then onward through the cold.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Beyond the frozen overlook... await the first glimpse of the sun to your left... then onward through the cold.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Beyond the frozen overlook... and all that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just up ahead...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oof, it's cold...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Just a bit farther...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Almost there...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
It's... beautiful.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The surface, wind-swept, wracked by freezing cold, nonetheless instills within the prince a sense of awe, and the sublime. For it is unlike anything that he has seen.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Is this... it can't...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
<Gasp>,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm here...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Warmer, finally...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What are these things...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"All manner of fruits and vegetables thrive within the hidden gardens of Persephone, the one-time Queen of all the Underworld. A world of life, far from the realm of death.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
I'm leaving. Try and stop me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Beyond the present chamber lies the outermost perimeter of Tartarus, promising terrifying dangers far beyond the Underworld Prince's reckoning.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The gods were pleased with all his bravery.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Storyteller,droppedMale
Who's it going to be.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Which sister this time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"One Fury sister, coming up.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Time to face the Furies.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I bet Alecto's next.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll guess... Alecto.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Guessing Alecto.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I bet it's Meg again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Please be Meg?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Please be Meg.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I bet Tisipone's up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Time for Tisiphone maybe?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got a feeling it's Tisiphone this time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Hmm.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Tsch.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
So...,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
Oh.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Megaera,droppedMale
Hmph.,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Megaera,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Megaera,droppedMale
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Megaera,droppedMale
"Ready, Alecto.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ready, Sister!",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ready, Tis.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ready, sisters.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Ready, sisters?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Alecto, Tis, you ready?",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
"Erinyes, ready.",CHARACTER,Megaera,female
They'll just have to try harder next time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The Erinyes; known also as the Furies, they are the trusted sentinels of Lord Hades, charged with torturing the worst of mortalkind... and ridding the Underworld of any fool enough to trespass where they do not belong.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
<Laughter>,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
T'hah.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Pshh.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
So...!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Redblood!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Finally.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Oh, finally.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
You...!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Pff.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Nrrggh....,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Good...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Well!,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Well, well!",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Oh, good.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Oh...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Trash god...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
There you are.,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Erinyes, ready.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
"Ready, sisters.",CHARACTER,Alecto,female
Mrrr...?,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
Mrr...,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
Mrr...,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
Drrr...,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
Mmmrr...,CHARACTER,Tisiphone,female
OK...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Got to keep going.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, Father? I'm trespassing through your secret hall, and going up.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Don't mind me, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'll just be a moment, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Off to Asphodel.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's hear it, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Well, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Moving on.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Next stop, Asphodel.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Up we go then.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll just go on up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Going up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's go up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"See you, Tartarus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Heading up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's enough Tartarus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
So much for Tartarus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Broke out of Tartarus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Till next time, Tartarus.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Nowhere to go but up.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Closer to the surface.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Next floor.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Up we go.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Lovely.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The path from Tartarus is finally laid bare. Far above, the heat from Phlegethon, the river of flame, is faintly felt already... even as its dangers lie in wait.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
I barge where I please.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"None, other than those in the trusted inner circle of Lord Hades, are authorized to enter the intricate chambers connecting the vast regions of the Underworld; but the Prince decides to barge in, anyway.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
Anyone else...?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Had enough?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's what you get.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That'll show you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"See you next time, I'm sure?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's what you get.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Back to the shadows.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who's laughing now?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Stay out of my way next time.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Takes care of that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You stab me, I stab you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's do this again sometime!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"The most violent wretches of Tartarus are sealed away even from other condemned souls; their only visitors, those fool enough to attempt escape.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
They basically turn into big crystals.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Damned, lost souls with nowhere left to turn congregate in deepest Tartarus, where they fuse together with the earth itself into odious forms which defy description.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"A place of calm and respite, whilst perhaps unimaginable in the Underworld, occasionally is to be found, in fact.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The infernal wares of the stygian boatman, Charon, lie sprawled about, available for sale to whomever would be willing to quench the boatman's great thirst for riches.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"The River Styx flows infamously through the Underworld, offering the boatman Charon expeditious travel from the realm of mortals to the lowest depths, where many of their shades reside forever.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
The gods were pleased with all his bravery.,CHARACTER,DROPPED_Storyteller,droppedMale
"I have to tell you something, little Hades: My relatives and I, we've been holding back one of our greatest gifts!! To see if you were worthy. And you are! My aid is yours, so call me if you need anything! Especially to smash your enemies to bits.",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Nephew! I'm mightily impressed with your ability to cull those rivers there of all the denizens of my domain! Your crusty father's not entitled to the bounties of the sea! But, on my limitless authority, you are! You have my Rod of Fishing... now have this!",CHARACTER,Poseidon,male
"Hoh, what's this.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Already.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Oh good.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should help me on my way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A gift from the gods.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Somebody's looking out for me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Something from Olympus.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Something for my journey.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
One for the road.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Good-bye, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
To hell with this place.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Shut up, old man.",CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
Wasn't planning on it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Wasn't about to start.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No. Not on your life.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm getting there.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You failed. I won't.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No harm in giving it another shot.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm not staying. Not even for him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm not staying. Not even for him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll show you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll have to be more careful.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
What's life without a little pain.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Mortals know to make the most of it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Get out of my head.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Fear is for the weak.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Good-bye, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm well past wondering.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I wonder if I'll beat you once again.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
At last I know the gods more than by name.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Blood and darkness, well indeed.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"This one's for you, Achilles.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
That's what you think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm leaving, Father. Try and stop me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
At least Zeus is helping me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Glad I'm on his good side...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll find my place all right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've found my place I think.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My place is with my mother.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
He's right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"We've put each other through a lot, haven't we, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"See you again soon, Meg.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll show you neat and orderly.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No one gets out.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll be the judge of that.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Oh, I don't know, the surface is quite nice.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
We gods are all alike.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You don't mean that, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll leave my mark all right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You got that right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"File this, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Not even the Pact of Punishment can stop me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Nyx, give me strength.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who's ready for the real afterlife experience?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll show you willfulness.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Guess that's a compliment!,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I take some pride in making messes, yes.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How about I take a closer look.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You don't need me, and I don't need you.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
How times have changed.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm no mere mortal.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"If only you could see me now, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've both my parents' eyes.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Time for another blood spree, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"How about now, Father?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll find out for myself.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Does seem that way.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm getting used to it.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Just have to cross a couple rivers, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll go where I please.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Think you can stop me?,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm sure you'll think of something soon enough.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I am the god of blood.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
You stay away from me.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll be sure to say hello.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Headed over to Elysium right now...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Who needs your rivers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Whatever you say...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
...Ceaseless chatter.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I've anger enough.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Not afraid of you or your damn spear.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I could take him.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Fear is for the weak...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's find some gemstones then.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Guess I'll see what I can do about it, Father.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
No one will worship you.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
The power of Night.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
post-ending,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"My differences have made me strong, all right.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Here's to my friends and family...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I swear, this family...",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Still figuring our boundaries out I guess.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"You taught me that, at least.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"I'm fond of running, thanks.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I will.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Set your aim higher, too.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It's nice enough to visit, anyhow.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'll see what I can do.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
This is our home.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Time to uphold it, then.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
A little pride's all right.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Wait for me, Mother. I'll be there soon.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
To hell with this place.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
I'm getting out of here.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Hoh, what's this.",CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
"Composed of such innumerable ever-shifting interlocking chambers, the Underworld of Lord Hades all but guarantees the dead shall there remain until the end of time.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Each time the Prince delves back into the Underworld, its ever-shifting chambers realign to frustrate his attempts to perhaps map it out.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Within the depths of Tartarus reside the most wretched of all the shades who linger for eternity within the Underworld, whose Lord and Master is especially unkind to those attempting to cheat death.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Few tales are told of Hades, whose very name inspires fear and penitence, reminding us of the inevitable fate which we all share.",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"I, however, mean to tell you such a tale. Listen carefully...",CHARACTER,Storyteller,male
"Family? Death is your only family. Death, and I. Best get accustomed to the both of us.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Death is inescapable. If you think otherwise... why, then, don't let me stop you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nobody gets out of here, boy, whether alive or dead. You think I jest? You think I haven't tried?!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"That dog is not your plaything, boy! Cerberus defends our realm so that no-one gets in alive, or gets out either way.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You are a weakling, boy! Disgraceful!! Now, strike again, and make it hurt, this time!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Watch where you step, you oaf! My House is not a sty through which to track your filth!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"A mortal's life is short, and fraught with pain; is that truly the life you yearn for, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What have I wrought, that such a witless, careless brat would be my progeny?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The fear of death keeps mortals well in check. You'd best learn to fear something yourself, you hear me, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How dare you, boy! Learn well to shut that foolish mouth of yours, or I shall shut it for you!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You have a tendency to ask too many questions, boy. Would that you had a tendency to wonder silently, instead.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You're not to speak of that accursed Mount Olympus in this household, do you hear me? Nor shall you invoke the names of its inhabitants.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Say it: Blood and darkness. It's a curse, boy. Say it with me. Blood. And. Darkness. Each available in high abundance here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Time you learned the bearing of the gods, and to assert yourself. For this I have employed the greatest of the Greeks, or what became of him.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Where do you think you are? Who do you think you're talking to? Nobody gets out of my domain, whether alive or dead.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You wish to meet your uncle Zeus someday? Imagine me, with a luxurious white mane, without a modicum of self-control. That's your Zeus.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"In my domain, you either find your place, or learn your place. There's work enough to go around, believe you me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"This is where you belong. You feel out of place? Where would you even go, what would you have me do? Your place is here.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"One thing the mortals have on us is that they quickly become men. This is the Fury, Megaera. She shall accelerate the process in your case.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The dead are judged and sent to Asphodel, Elysium, or Tartarus. We keep the process neat and orderly. Everyone gets in, no one gets out.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Nyx is the Night herself; her twin sons, Sleep, and Death! But, you? I cannot think of anything, I fear! Except the god of talking back to me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Your place is here, and nowhere else. The same as it is mine. There's naught of any worth to see beyond this realm, besides.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Poseidon's an incomparable fool I am ashamed to call my brother. He can shake the earth up there all he pleases; he is unwelcome here.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Elysium? It isn't for the good; it's for the great. Great kings or killers. Oft one and the same. They left their mark upon the world. Shall you?,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"For their mistakes in life, the wretched shades of Tartarus are bound to me in death, however hatefully. They answer to me; quite unlike you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How many times must I explain this, boy? Each Pact of Punishment needs to be promptly signed, and sealed, and filed. Rather than pile up!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"What exactly is it, boy, that makes you feel entitled to show me such disrespect? You dare not say such things to Mother Nyx!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Asphodel has flooded once again, with flame! Not quite the afterlife experience promised to the dead residing there, now, is it, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Upon my name, you lack the cheerfulness of Hypnos and the competence of Thanatos, but have more willfulness than both, combined!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Sometimes I think this mess you call your chambers is one which you've cultivated with great pride, is that the way of it?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Do not stray far again into the pits of Tartarus, or become lost like all its residents. Content yourself to look upon it from afar.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Sulk in your chambers all you like, for I care not! I have eternity to finish with this work, so your assistance is entirely unneeded.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why do you bleed like mortals do? An aberration, nothing more! And nothing to be proud of. I suggest you keep it to yourself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Don't you dare look at me like that, boy, with your mismatched eyes. You save it for yourself. You have a mirror in your chambers, don't you?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How suitably disgusting. Fling your blood at me like that again, boy, and I'll have you cast into the Styx, where you can drown in it.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The surface is off limits. And furthermore, you are forbidden from the Temple of Styx, until such time as you are fit to tend the situation there.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You wish to feel the breeze against your skin? Perhaps the coolness of the seas? You shall writhe from such sensations, I assure you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You are immortal, boy, but in a manner, you can die; as you now understand. A most unpleasant feeling, is it not?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
The rivers flowing through this realm divide its regions suitably enough. And every shade knows better than to try and cross them!,CHARACTER,Hades,male
Why are some chambers in my House off limits? Someone deserving access would not ask. You can't always go where you please.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The Infernal Arms are sealed away for a reason, boy! Your curiosity exceeds your common sense, but heed my words, you stay away from those accursed things!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Heroes? Mere mortals, same as all the rest. Someday you shall visit Elysium and meet some of these heroes, and discover that they are quite different than the songs suggest.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"How dare you to insinuate Poseidon has the slightest jurisdiction, here! Once waters from the surface flow beneath the earth, they become mine. Each of the rivers, they are mine, not his!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You would have better conversation with your chamber-walls than with the boatman Charon, boy. Not all those of the Underworld are prone to ceaseless chatter quite like you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Now, fling the blasted thing again, I said! And put your anger into it, this time, like so. Or if you've not anger enough for it yet, you'll learn, I promise you.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Never lay hands upon Gigaros, boy, ever again. The power in that spear could tear you to pieces finer than the ones to which some of your ancestors were once reduced.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"All of this realm are born of darkness, boy. It's part of everything you'll ever see. The mortals on the surface, they all fear it, foolish as they are. Unable to even see its power.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"These gemstones that you mock, boy, are a symbol of the power of this realm. To you they're merely trinkets, but to mortals, gemstones hold more value than their very lives.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Another vermin outbreak near the surface, then. Would that I had someone dependable to deal with it. Where are those blasted satyrs coming from, and to what end? The vile things.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You seek such fame as your great relatives upon their mountaintop? Seek to be valuable, not to be known. Obscurity is not what makes you weak. Worship from mortals is a nuisance, not a boon.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You need to learn to hold a spear, observe! A sturdy grip is necessary, here and here. Though, we must find for you an instructor with more time to spare.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
You must accept that you are not like all the others here. Your differences do not make you deficient. They can make you strong. It's up to you.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"I have no idle time to spare you, boy! Have you observed the parchmentwork upon my desk? Go play with Thanatos, or Hypnos, or the dog. I need to finish this!",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Your grandparents? The Titans, they were called. Long since passed from this world, boy. You have my assurance, however, that you did not miss much, in having never met.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Keep to yourself, then! Our House is not so great in size, thus boundaries must be set. I shall refrain from entering your chambers, as you shall never again try to enter mine.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Waste not your time, though it is limitless. Busy yourself in doing things of use. Learn. Learn how to learn. I cannot teach you everything myself.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"The Eldest Sigil shall never work for you, boy. Only a privileged few have unconstrained authority to traverse this realm, and you are not among them, I'm afraid.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"You call this shouting?! This is not shouting, boy. This is merely having certain expectations, which you have not met. Now, try once again.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Look to me for clear instruction, boy! Not for the embodiment of the standard to which you are held. Set your aim higher than to be like me.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Forget about the surface, boy! You are not missing much. Here we have warmth, and wealth. Stability! Up there? Nothing of the sort.",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Speak not to me of failure! Failure is the greatest instructor of all. Your existence is a sequence of mistakes; avoid making the same one twice.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Ask Nyx about such things, do not ask me! She is the one born to this realm. I am a foreigner. Moved here to take this job, can you believe it, boy?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
Mortals believe that there is no return from here. They are correct! And we all must do our part to keep it that way. We have a certain reputation to uphold.,CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Why am I never proud of you? Don't take it personally, boy. I'm never proud of anything. Pride is perhaps our family's worst trait. See how many mortals are with us, because of it?",CHARACTER,Hades,male
"Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant; annihilate all who oppose me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Exagryph, the Adamant Rail; come turn my foes to ash.",CHARACTER,DROPPED_Zagreus,droppedMale
I need the rail.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ready, Exagryph?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Coronacht, the Heart-Seaker; let's deal some death.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Think I need my bow...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Let's go, Coronacht.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Coronacht hungers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Aegis, Shield of Chaos; lend me your power.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My shield...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Aegis, protect me.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Aegis hungers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Varatha, the Eternal Spear; join my pursuit.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Should take my spear...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"It's time, Varatha.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Varatha hungers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Stygius, Blade of the Underworld; I need your strength.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
My blade...,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Come, Stygius.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Stygius hungers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Malphon, the Twin Fists; what say we crack some skulls.",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Twin Fists of Malphon; our strength combined surely cannot be stopped.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Whoa, those are some paws!",CHARACTER,Skelly,male
Could use the Fists.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Let's punch things up a bit.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
"Ready, Malphon?",CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Malphon hungers.,CHARACTER,Zagreus,male
Pain...,CHARACTER,Alecto,female
