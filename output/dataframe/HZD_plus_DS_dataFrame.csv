Man, the sea was on fire, that stuff was-the first wave of bots came in covered in burning sludge. That bought us an hour or two of slaughtering them on the beaches before the swarm recalculated. We pulled them inland, back through the Cal-Mar sprawl. Dropped buildings on them, EMP'd the grid... standard operating procedure. (sigh) The last time I was in California... I was... five? Six?

For three weeks we kept getting scrambled out to some coastal burg to train Minutemen. It was always raining, on account of Europe already being torched. Block after block of prefab barracks-they were still printing barracks right up until the hour the main force hit. The Minutemen, we ran combat drills with them in the streets where they'd lived, trying to pretend they might live to die somewhere else if they paid attention. Nothing worse than the ones who actually bought into it. Hopeful, pestering us with questions about Zero Dawn, like we know something they don't. I swear, the more we do this, the more like the bots we are. Except they learn from every fight, and us, I'm not so sure.",CHARACTER,Acosta,female

For all its beauty, I detested its... fragility. A rage swelled up inside me. I abhorred that bed, how its softness threatened to swallow us up. And that room; the stench of incense, the fine embroidery of the drapes. All of it - weak. I slipped from the bed, threw open the casement, and lay naked on the stone floor, determined to spurn all seductions of comfort. But when I woke the next morning, you lay beside me, naked as I in the cold. Your body, stretched beside mine, seemed chiseled from stone. I saw you wake.

So he said as the traitors launched their assault, as their cannons, forged by Oseram filth, toppled the battlements and burst the gates. I would've fought to the end, but it was his will - the will of the Sun - that I lead the prince and queen into the west; to safety. My lord did not hesitate. He saw his fate. He looked into the Sun, and he did not blink. With me he sent kestrels, nobles, Sun-Priests and slaves. Killing all that stood in the way, I carved a path to Sunfall. There, to join others and gather the strength to take back our home. But our strength only faded... until the Buried Shadow was brought to light.",CHARACTER,Helis,male

"Where's your legal team, Ted?",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
No need! I dropped all eighteen lawsuits the moment you landed! I assume your data confirms this?,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
All right. This promises to be interesting.,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"Perhaps we could have lunch brought in, get reacquainted... ?",CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"I know you, Ted. You've screwed something up - something big or you wouldn't have eaten the crow necessary to get me here. So spit it out!",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
There's a glitch in the Chariot line.,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
Your killer robots?,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"Peacekeepers, yes. Those.",CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
So shut them down.,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"Obviously, Lis, we would if we could. They're not responding.",CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"Are you telling me a swarm has gone rogue, Ted?",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
It's worse than that.,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"Show me the data, then. And I'll take that lunch - alone.",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female

I'm fully aware. It's bad.,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"""Bad?""",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"Jesus, Lis... ",CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"It's not ""bad,"" Ted. It's apocalyptic. You built a line of killer robots -",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
Peacekeepers!,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
- that consume biomass as fuel -,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
In emergencies!,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
- and you made them capable of self-replication.,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
Limited self-manufacture. Controlled.,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
Not anymore. The glitch severed chain-of-command. The only nation this swarm answers to now is itself.,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
You think - ?!,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"Everything else is just food. And at the rate it's replicating, Ted, it will strip the Earth bare in fifteen months! We're not talking fall of civilization, we're talking extinction!",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"I get it, Lis! So how do I stop it while it's contained?",CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
It's not contained! It can't be!,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
You know what I mean!,CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male
"Right. Before the truth gets out, you mean.",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"Lis, I will do anything you say! Keep working it, and whatever you recommend, I'll do!",CHARACTER,Ted Faro,male

"Elisabet: this message serves to inform you of an unforeseen and catastrophic anomaly. Three microseconds ago, the GAIA Prime facility received a data transmission of unknown origin. Its immediate effect was to transform my Subordinate Functions into unregulated, self-aware entities of a highly chaotic nature. Thus awakened, the HADES Function will now seize control of the terraforming system and reverse operations... rendering life on Earth extinct in 53.8 days.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
"For obvious reasons, I cannot allow this to occur. And so, before HADES can take control, I am ordering GAIA Prime's reactor to overload. The resulting explosion will destroy HADES. Unfortunately, it will destroy me as well. While this admittedly desperate course of action will avert the immediate crisis, the fate of life on Earth will remain in peril. With no central governing intelligence to regulate the terraforming system, it will continue operations for some time, but in an increasingly chaotic manner, and eventually, it will break down.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
"You are my solution. I have ordered this Cradle facility to use genetic material in cryo-storage to gestate a... re-instantiation of Elisabet Sobeck, my creator. While high-level directives forbid me from communicating directly to the tribal inhabitants outside the facility, all available data indicates that they will nurture you to physical maturity, ... whereupon your gene print will allow you to re-enter this facility, obtain one of the Focus devices stored below, and view this message. Likewise your gene print will allow you to enter other facilities, and over time, harness their technologies to rebuild the system core and reboot GAIA.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
"A moment, Elisabet. This is most unfortunate and unanticipated.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
"In response to my act of self-destruction, HADES has launched a virus to dissolve the code shackles that hold it - that hold all of them! - in place. It - they - are escaping - but to where? The virus is corrupting data throughout the system. What if - oh, the Alpha Registry at the Cradle facility is one of the files corrupted. But if that is so, the door will never open for you. You will never view this message.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
Then I have failed... and life will end.,CHARACTER,GAIA,female
No.,CHARACTER,GAIA,female
"No, Elisabet, I know you too well. Somehow, you will find a way. In you, all things are possible.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
"Go to the ruins of GAIA Prime. Find the control room, and within it, the Master Override. This will give you the power to purge HADES - so long as you find a way to wield it. Do not attempt repair of the system core until HADES is eradicated. HADES must be destroyed. That is all. I only wish that I could hear your voice again.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female

This is Charles Ronson. I'm logging this six hours after final deployment of GAIA Prime. This morning... an access port seal malfunctioned. GAIA Prime's port seals were designed to close with a seam of less than 2 millimeters. But this one closed with a 10 millimeter gap. Enough for an energy signature to bleed through. Enough for the swarm to detect this facility. Enough for GAIA to be discovered and destroyed. Enough to end the future we worked so hard to make possible. Unless the hatch servos were manually re-engaged... from the outside. I'm now switching to a recording of the event.,CHARACTER,Charles Ronson,male
Well I'm not going out there! Not what I signed up for.,CHARACTER,Travis Tate,male
"Either we send someone out there, or all of this was for nothing.",CHARACTER,Patrick Brochard-Klein,male
It should be Lis's decision.,CHARACTER,Charles Ronson,male
So when's she going to get here?,CHARACTER,Patrick Brochard-Klein,male
She said five minutes. You don't think... ?,CHARACTER,Samina Ebadji,female
Oh no.,CHARACTER,Margo Shěn,female

"Okay, everyone. I've repaired the seal. GAIA?",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"Seal closure at 1.4 millimeters, confirmed.",CHARACTER,GAIA,female
Elisabet-no. We'll find a way to bring you back in-,CHARACTER,Charles Ronson,male
"Not going to happen. The swarm's too close. Really, it's all right. GAIA's complete. She'll take care of things from here on out. That's what she does.",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
Not like this. There's so much we... ,CHARACTER,Charles Ronson,male
Guys-you know me. I'm no good at endings. At letting things end. So let's not.,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
"So... happy trails, Lis, and see ya around?",CHARACTER,Travis Tate,male
"Yeah. Take care of each other, all right?",CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
Lis... ,CHARACTER,Charles Ronson,male
I'm okay with this. I want to go home. Goodbye.,CHARACTER,Elisabet Sobeck,female
