<p><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Greetings, traveler. Rasha wishes you well and thinks you maybe can help him with some pressing business."</i>
</p><p><b>pressing business</b> <i>"Yes. Most pressing. I have, you see, a shipment of clothing...fine clothing, it is...to get to Ald-ruhn. But, I fear other business draws me away. Perhaps, I think, you and I might come to an arrangement, yes? If you will deliver Rasha's shirts...these fine, fine shirts...to Bivale Teneran the clothier in Ald-ruhn, she will pay you for your services. And a generous woman she is. I would ask that you swear an oath to Zenithar to seal our arrangement, though. Yes. What do you think of my offer, hmmmm?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>"I'm sorry. I cannot do that now."</b> <i>"No? Very sad for both of us. We both stood to gain much. Perhaps you are already cursed by Zenithar, yes? Perhaps he will not accept your oath. I must go. I don't want your curse to be rubbing off on me. No, not on me."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Must get fine shirts to marketplace."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>"I swear to Zenithar I will deliver your shipment."</b> <i>"Most excellent, yes? We will both gain from this...I shall keep my good name, and you shall benefit from Teneran's generosity. Wonderful. Take care, [PC Name], one should not take an oath sworn to Zenithar lightly. No, never lightly."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>"You swore by Zenithar you would deliver my shirts. Please, go now. I have given you the shirt from my back, and must have that delivery."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
