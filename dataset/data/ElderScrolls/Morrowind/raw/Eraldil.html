<p><b>Gadayn Andarys</b> <i>"That lowly Hlaalu trader? He's ridiculous."</i>
</p><p><b>love letter</b> (during the quest "For the Love of a Bosmer") <i>"He thinks I might be interested in him? Ha! That's a ridiculous notion. The very thought...insane. I mean, has he seen himself in a mirror lately? I'm sure he's a decent enough sort, but that's ridiculous. He might be more suited for my cousin Glathel. She's low-born, plain, and desperate for a husband. But me? You can tell Gadayn that you've spoken to Eraldil, and she's not interested!"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Glathel</b> <i>"She's a decent, if rather common sort. I mean, I don't have much to do with her. She's rather plain, not too bright. But she's not a bad person, for what she is. You can find her at the Elven Nations Cornerclub. She's a serving girl."</i>
<dl><dd><b>apology from Gadayn</b> <i>"He wishes to apologize? How very noble. But, at least he sent a gift along, which is certainly appropriate. Well, I'm sure I'll have use for it sometime, although it's probably not even of good quality."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Gadayn Andarys</b> (as his wife) <i>"That husband of mine? He's cheap, pathetic, stupid, lazy, messy, uncaring, clinging, and rather smelly. But I love him!"</i></dd></dl>
<p><b>rumors</b> <i>"Have you heard? Seven victims? Here in Vivec? All with their throats slit? When it was just a few outlanders killed, the Ordinators weren't making much fuss. But now that they've had two of their own people with slit throats, they seem very concerned at the Hall of Justice. I've heard that the Office of the Watch is quietly looking around for some special help. Anything that can kill TWO Ordinators before they can draw their weapons sounds like it will NEED special help."</i>
