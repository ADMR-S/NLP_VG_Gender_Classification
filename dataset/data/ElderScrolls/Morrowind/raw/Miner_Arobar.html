<dl><dd><b>Redoran Hortator</b> <i>"I have given you my own vote for the great title of Hortator of House Redoran. The challenge of convincing the rest of the House Redoran Council is now yours. Perhaps a word of advice is in order. You may find that the Archmaster Bolvyn Venim will be difficult to win to your side. If you cannot convince him of your good will, may I suggest challenging him to a duel? He will be difficult to defeat in combat, but if you are truly the Hortator and the Nerevarine, you are fated to succeed."</i></dd></dl>
