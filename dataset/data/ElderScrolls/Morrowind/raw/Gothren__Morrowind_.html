It's an archaic tradition, not invoked since I was an apprentice. Since a Hortator's duty is to lead a Great House in war, and we haven't had a war in a very long time, we have no need of a Hortator."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Tell your story and ask to be confirmed as Hortator.</b> <i>"No. Wait. Let me think.... Yes. I understand perfectly. Your story makes sense. Your proofs are persuasive.... But a decision on such a remarkable matter is a grave responsibility, and not to be taken in haste. I will need some time to reflect and consider, and to confer with the other Telvanni counselors. Leave me."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

It is not in Telvanni interests to name an unknown and unreliable outlander and outsider to such an important position. My opinion will not change. If you persist in bothering me, you will regret it.
