<dl><dd><b>Dissident Priests</b> <i>"We are fiercely loyal to the Temple's ancient traditions. But we are troubled that the ultimate source of the Tribunal's divinity might be the same as the source of Dagoth Ur's evil power. Dagoth Ur's power seems to wax as the Tribunal's power wanes. Read 'The Progress of Truth' and other documents of the Apographa in our library, and you'll see why we are uneasy."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
