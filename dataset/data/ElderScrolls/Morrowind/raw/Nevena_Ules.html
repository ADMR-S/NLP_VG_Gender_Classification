</p>
<dl><dd><b>Hlaalu Hortator</b> <i>"I think that's some kind of war leader. Why are you interested?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Ask how a Hortator is chosen.</b> <i>"I don't know. Don't we already have a Hortator? If we don't, maybe we can find one somewhere."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Tell your story and ask to be confirmed as Hortator.</b> <i>"I don't understand at all. What is this about stars and a prophesy? No, don't tell me again. I don't know why you want to be a Hortator. It's all very confusing. Maybe I should talk to the other counselors. And my advisors."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Hortator's duty</b> <i>"A Hortator is a champion who leads by inspiration. He challenges opposing heroes in single combat. He goes on long, desperate quests. He goes alone into the citadels of the enemy. He confronts the dangers no one else in the House is strong enough... or courageous enough... to face."</i></dd>
<dd><b>choose a Hortator</b> <i>"A Hortator is chosen by consensus. Everyone has to agree. A single 'no' is a veto. First a Great House has to choose a Hortator. Then that Hortator has to go persuade the other Great Houses to agree to name him Hortator of their houses, too. A very difficult system. No Great House wants to give the honor to a member of another Great House. But luckily, it's mostly honorary, and doesn't cost a House anything. So it might no be that bad, after all."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><b>Tell your story and ask to be confirmed as Hortator.</b> <i>"That's a very strange story, with all the stars and prophecies. I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.
