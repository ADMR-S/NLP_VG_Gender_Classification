<dl><dd><b>Hlaalu Hortator</b> <i>"Yes. Of course. You wished to be named Hortator of House Hlaalu? No sooner said than done.

Once all the councilors agree, speak with Crassius Curo again. He will give you the Belt of the Hortator."</i>

<dl><dd><b>Tell the location of Vassir-Didanat.</b> <i>"So you've been there? And there is still ebony there? I will have someone investigate right away to confirm your story, but I trust you. Take these 2000 drakes with my gratitude."</i>
