<dd><b>Unrest in Cyrodiil City</b> <i>"Things are bad for man and Khajiit. The provinces war with one another, never smelling the common enemy in their midst. The Empire spreads its troops far and wide with strict orders to do nothing. Children no longer respect their elders. People no longer respect the law. Corruption is everywhere. There are no heroes like there were in Jobasha's grandmother's day. All this fuss over the Emperor's illness is just a symptom."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Vedam Dren</b> <i>"Duke Dren sent guards to Jobasha's store. Are they to protect Jobasha, or to protect others from Jobasha? Either way, Jobasha appreciates it."</i></dd></dl>
