<p><i>"Yes. I'm Mehra Milo, a librarian for the Hall of Wisdom. Can I tell you about <b>our collection</b>?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>our collection</b> <i>"Volumes of general interest can be found in our Main Reading Room. Other collections are found in rooms adjoining the Main Reading Room. Our special collections include Western Studies -- the Empire and the provinces -- history, arts, and crafts, law and custom, and geography. The reserve room contains works on heathen cults. These volumes are not for sale, of course, and may not leave these rooms."</i></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Yes. I'm Mehra Milo. Caius sent you? Follow me into the back of the library. We can't talk here."</i>

<p><i>"Go ahead. I'm afraid I don't know anything about a Sixth House cult, but I can tell you about the <b>Nerevarine cult</b>."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine cult</b> <i>"The Temple worships Nerevar as a saint and hero, but prophecies of his reincarnation are punished as wicked heresy. The Nerevarine cult claims the Tribunal are false gods, hence the Temple's <b>persecution of the Nerevarine</b> cult. A group called the <b>Dissident Priests'</b> disputes Temple doctrine on the <b>Nerevarine prophecies</b>. The proscribed book '<b>Progress of Truth'</b> describes their beliefs. Get a copy of 'Progress of Truth' for <b>Caius Cosades</b>. That will tell him things he needs to know about the Nerevarine cult."</i>
<dl><dd><b>peresecution of the Nerevarine</b> <i>"It's an Ashlander cult -- primitive superstition, says the Temple. Nerevarines say the Tribunal are false gods. I've never understood whu the Temple wastes so much energy on them. The faithful cannot be shaken by such attacks, and the Ashlanders are just ignorant savages. But since the submission of the Temple to the Empire, and the crosion of faith among the Dunmer, the militant wing of the Temple is increasingly fierce in its attacks on heretics and heathens."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Dissident Priests</b> <i>"The Dissident Priests dispute Temple doctrine, and are outlawed and <b>persecuted by the Temple</b>. <b>Ordinators</b> arrest and imprison heretics, and the Empire cannot interfere. 'Progress of Truth' lists their beliefs. In brief, they challenge the purity and divinity of the Tribunal, suggesting their powers are sorcerous, not divine, and perhaps akin to the powers of <b>Dagoth Ur</b>. They also condemn the arbitrary power of the Ordinators, and accuse the Temple hierarchy of self-interest and corruption."</i>
<dl><dd><b>persecuted by the Temple</b> <i>"Why does the Temple persecute the Dissident Priests? Because attacks on the Temple weaken the faith, and leave the people defenseless against the influence of Dagoth Ur. Faith is what strengthens the will of the believer against Dagoth Ur's lies. Faith is the source of the divine power that sustains the Tribunal in their battle with Dagoth Ur. Since the Empire, some Dunmer have turned away from the Temple; that's why Dagoth Ur grows stronger, why blight storms and monsters threaten the land."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Dagoth Ur</b> <i>"Dagoth Ur is the evil immortal enemy of the Tribunal Temple cult. The Temple holds Dagoth Ur and his hosts accountable for all the evils that beset the Dunmer and Morrowind. Dagoth Ur dwells in fiery caverns beneath Red Mountain, served by his kin, called ash vampires, and by legions of deformed monsters."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Nerevarine prophecies'</b> <i>"The Ashlanders have a mystical tradition of interpreting dreams and visions as prophecies. These prophecies are recorded in verse, and may be lost or garbled over the generations. But the Dissident Priests have collected many ancient prophecies of the Nerevarine, many of which they believe to be genuine. Collectively these are caled the Lost Prophecies of the Incarnate. One of the sacred missions of the Dissident Priests is the collection and study of these prophecies."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Progress of Truth</b> <i>"This book lists the disputes of the Dissident priests with Tribunal Temple doctrines. The Temple has outlawed the sale or possession of the book, so it will be hard to find. We have a copy here, but I fear I'm being <b>watched by Ordinators</b> here. A safer plan would be to search local booksellers. Some booksellers ignore Temple bans on outlawed books for profits or for principles."</i>
<dl><dd><b>watched by Ordinators</b> <i>"I do not care for Temple politics. But I have read 'Progress of Truth,' and it troubles me. I have friends, former priests, who have gone into hiding, so I am bound to come to the attention of the Ordinators. I am careful, but I'm afraid. I'm no secret agent, like you or Caius. Sooner or later I, too, must go into hiding. If it is not too late. When you return to Caius, tell him I am worried, and that if something goes wrong, I will leave a message under the agreed code word 'amaya.'"</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Caius Cosades</b> <i>"Caius is a dear friend. Like me, he admires the best traditions of the Temple, charity for the poor, education for the ignorant, protection for the weak. He is a Westerner, but he has come to love our land and our people. But like me, he distrusts the arbitrary power of the Ordinators, and like the Dissident priests, he suspects the Temple is hiding something. He serves the Emperor, but he also loves Morrowind, and he sees the failing virtues of the Temple as a threat to Morrowind's political stability."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"As I said, get Caius a copy of Progress of Truth and that should tell him things he needs to know about the <b>Nerevarine cult</b>. Is there anything else you want to ask me about?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine cult</b> <i>"As I said, the Dissident priests have a book called 'Progress of Truth' which gives their views on the beliefs of the Nerevarine cult."</i></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"Do you have the <b>Divine Intervention scrolls</b>? I have an escape plan."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Divine Intervention scrolls</b> <i>"I left a note for you that told you I needed Divine Intervention scrolls. I need at least one for my escape plan. If you haven't got one, you'll have to go get me one."</i></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"Do you have the <b>Divine Intervention scrolls</b>? I have an escape plan."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Divine Intervention scrolls</b> <i>"I'll need one Divine Intervention scroll myself for my escape plan. Getting out will be a lot faster and safer for you if you have one, but if you haven't got one for yourself, maybe you can find some other way out. Now, listen. Here's my plan. Give me a Divine Intervention scroll. I'll meet you at the secret Dissident priests monastery at <b>Holamayan</b>. For safety, we'll travel separately.... When you get out of here, look for a woman named Blatta Hateria on the East Docks of Ebonheart. Tell her I sent you, and that you want to 'go fishing.' She'll bring you to Holamayan by boat. I'll meet you there, and we'll get the <b>lost prophecies</b> from Gilbas Barelo, the leader of the Dissident priests. ANd magic conceals the Holamayan entrance -- speak to Vevrana Aryon, a monk at the dock at Holamayan, about the hidden entrance."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Holamayan</b> <i>"Holamayan is a secret monastery of the Dissident priests. The monastery itself is beneath the surface of a remote island along Azura's Coast, with only a single entrance hidden from view by hills and vegetation. The monastery is further protected by a magical shield which opens only at dawn and dusk, the magical twilight hours sacred to Azura."</i></dd>
<dd><b>lost prophecies</b> <i>"We can't talk now, but in the Apographa -- the hidden teachings of the Temple -- there are several exstensive references to 'lost prophecies' -- prophecies no longer current among the Ashlanders, but recorded by earlier Temple pilgrims and scholars. And I think you'll find what you're looking for in the libraries of Holamayan."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"I'll meet you at Holamayan. Good luck. When you get there, talk to Gilvas Barelo. He should be able to help you with the Lost Prophecies you seek."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Caius Cosades</b> <i>"Caius has gone back to the Imperial City? He says he's been recalled? I wonder. I never know what he's thinking. I think he's involved in something secret, something dangerous. I was hoping he might help us. Now he's gone. I don't know what to think."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Soul sickness</b> <i>"Soul sickness is called "madness" or "insanity" in the Empire. Signs of soul sickness are strange dreams, uncontrollable impulses, and cruel and evil deeds. Madness is not a disease, as Westerners believe, for if it were, it might be cured by <b>blessings</b> and healers. Soul sickness is a curse of Dagoth Ur, who sends dark dreams to attack the weak of faith in their sleep. Those strong in faith can resist; those weak in faith must seek counsel from the Temple."</i>
<dl><dd><b>blessings</b> <i>"Temple faithful and reverent guests may make offerings at <b>shrines</b> and receive in return a blessing."</i>
<dl><dd><b>shrines</b> <i>"Shrines are three-sided trioliths where prayer and offerings are made for healing and blessings."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Thank you, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>, for rescuing me. Now I'll stay here at Holamayan with Master Barelo and assist him with the monastery's library."</i>
