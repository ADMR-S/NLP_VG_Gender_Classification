<p><i>"Welcome, friend. Perhaps I can interest you in some of my goods? I realize the <b>prices are a bit high</b>, but that is beyond my control."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>prices are a bit high</b> <i>"Yes, they are. Of course, since we only have one supplier, they set all the prices. The East Empire Company has a stranglehold on all of the imports to Vivec, so we are forced to pay whatever prices they set. While some other shipments of goods come into the ports at Ebonheart, they get held up by so much <b>bureaucracy</b>, it simply isn't profitable to ship here."</i>
<dl><dd><b>bureaucracy</b> <i>"It's ridiculous. Their ships are searched by the Duke's men, and are often held in customs for weeks at a time. Of course, the Company's boats aren't subject to the same scrutiny. I don't know what part the Duke is playing in this, but I'd certainly like to find out."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Perhaps I can help you.</b> <i>"Well, there is something you might be able to provide for me. I'd like to know who is setting the prices for the Company. I know much of the pricing goes through J'Zhirr in Ebonheart. If you can find some information on this for me, I'd greatly appreciate it."</i>
<dl><dd><b>bureaucracy</b> <i>"I really want to learn more about how they're <b>setting the prices</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>setting the prices</b> <i>"Well, I know they're not set simply by the market value of the goods. If you can find me some sort of a price list, I might be able to get an idea of what kind of game is being run here."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>I won't get involved in this.</b> <i>"I can't blame you. There's something strange going on there, and it might not be wise to get mixed up in it."</i>

<p><b>setting the prices</b> <i>"You've found a price list? Excellent! I... I can't believe this! This is from the Duke's office. He must be setting the margins for the Company and taking a cut of the profits! This is an outrage. I'll find another way to restock my goods. Thank you, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>. I'm sure you've learned a bit more about business from all of this. I'm sure this knowledge will help you in business dealings in the future."</i>
