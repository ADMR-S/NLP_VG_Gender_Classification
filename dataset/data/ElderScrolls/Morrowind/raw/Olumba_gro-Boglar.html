And he's solving the problem by skimming from the mine and <b>smuggling raw ebony</b>. That's what people say in private, anyway. It would be hard to get proof. The slaves in the Caldera ebony mines would know. But they would be hard to persuade to talk. They're afraid, and who can blame them?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>smuggling raw ebony</b> <i>"He takes raw ebony from the mines. He does not tell anyone. He pays no tax on it. He steals it from the mine, and avoids the tax. So when he sells it to smugglers, he makes a very fine profit indeed. No costs. All profit."</i></dd></dl></dd>
