<p><b>Greeting</b> (carrying the <i>Letter from Gadayn</i>) <i>"You say you've found a love letter of mine? Oh, dear. That is embarrassing."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>love letter</b> (if they have shown the letter to Eraldil) <i>"You've already shown it to her? So, you've spoken to Eraldil? What did she say?"</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>love letter</b> (if Eraldil is dead) <i>"Well, none of that matters anymore. I've heard that Eraldil is dead. Now we'll never be together."</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>love letter</b> <i>"You found that? Oh, dear. I really meant to throw that away. It's all true, though. I have loved her since the moment I first set eyes on her. I just haven't had the courage to speak to her yet. Perhaps you'll speak to her for me? Plead my case? I'd be very grateful."</i>
<dl><dd><b>"Sorry. You're on your own."</b> <i>"No? Well, perhaps one day I'll get the courage to speak with her myself."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>"I will speak to her on your behalf."</b> <i>"You will? Wonderful. If you'll just tell her how I feel, tell her how happy I'd make her, I'm sure she'd be interested. You'll probably find her in the Waistworks. That's where I've watched...seen her at times."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Have you spoken to Eraldil yet?"</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>love letter</b> <i>"One day she'll be mine. I'm sure of it."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>spoken to Eraldil</b> (if they have not spoken to her) <i>"Oh. Well, come back when you've spoken to her, friend!"</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>spoken to Eraldil</b> (if they have spoken to her) <i>"She said she wanted nothing to do with me? But...that's awful. I was certain she'd at least consider the idea. Well, I'll have to go to my backup plan."</i>
<dl><dd><b>backup plan</b> <i>"Well, I figured there was the slight chance she wouldn't be interested in me right away, so I had an alchemist mix up a special potion for me. For anyone else, it will seem a normal health potion, but if Eraldil drinks it, she'll find herself incredibly attracted to me. Perhaps you'll deliver it to her for me?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>"Perhaps you might speak to <a href="/wiki/Glathel" title="Glathel">her cousin</a>, instead."</b> <i>"Her cousin, you say? Well, I suppose this was a pretty ridiculous scam. And...if her cousin has half of Eraldil's beauty, she'd still be twice as beautiful as any other woman I've met. Perhaps I'll look her up some time, friend. Thank you for your help."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> (after ten days) <i>"Greetings, friend! What a wonderful day! As you can see, all is well with me...or should I say us? Glathel and I are now married, and nothing could be better."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>nothing could be better</b> <i>"It's been simply wonderful, my friend. Glathel and I are perfectly suited for one another. Here, please take this as a token of our gratitude."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>How can I help you, my favorite friend?</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>"I'll deliver the potion for you."</b> <i>"I appreciate the help, friend. Just tell her it's an apology from Gadayn. She should accept it then. Then, once she drinks it, she'll fall into my arms in no time!"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Did you deliver the potion to Eraldil?"</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>apology from Gadayn</b> <i>"Yes, I'm sure she'll accept my apologies...and the potion of course."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><b>backup plan</b> <i>"Well, there's a reason it's a backup plan, you know."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I'll make sure to name our first child after you. How does [PC Name] Andarys sound? Oh, and take this as a token of our friendship. Soon she'll be mine!"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Oh. It's you. Well, I hope you're happy. That stupid love potion idea of yours worked, and now look what it's gotten me. She's a monster! Nagging, complaining, spending all my money. How could you let me get into this? Well, what do you want?"</i>
