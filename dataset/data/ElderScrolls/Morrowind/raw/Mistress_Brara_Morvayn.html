He has done great things for House Redoran, but he can be a difficult man. He cannot honorably decline a challenge if you have the council's support, and if he were to die in an honorable duel, I and the other counilors would still support you."</i></dd></dl>

He believed that the beasts were attracted by a statue we received a few weeks before the attacks began. Go to Morvayn Manor, just east of Skar, here's the key. Get the statue, and take it to Lloros Sarano at the Temple. Once the statue has been destroyed, I will support you on the Council."</i></dd></dl>
