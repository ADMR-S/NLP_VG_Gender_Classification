<p><i>"What is it, mortal? Have you come to be of service to Sheogorath? That in and of itself speaks toward your madness. This pleases me. Fetch the Fork of Horripilation from the mad hermit near Ald Redaynia. Take care with him. He's not the most...stable man. Use the Fork wisely, mortal. Few have wielded it who have not come away changed. Use the Fork to strike a deathblow to the giant bull netch that resides near the hermit. Do this, return the Fork of Horripilation to me, and Sheogorath will reward you well."</i>

<p><i>"Ah...I see you have completed my little errand. Well done. Perhaps you've gotten a taste of madness as well? Do not believe madness to be a curse, mortal. For some, it is the greatest of blessings...a bitter mercy perhaps, but mercy nonetheless. Give me the Fork of Horripilation. I believe I have something more suitable for your needs. Go now. Remember what you have seen."</i>
