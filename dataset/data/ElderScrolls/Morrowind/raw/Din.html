Sorry...I really need some help. Maybe you can get me to a healer? To hell with the healers. I don't need one! That Mehra Drora is a healer, but I don't like the way she looks at me. All of Gnisis is like that. Don't look at me!"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Perhaps you'd better follow me to the healer in Gnisis. I think she can help you.</b> <i>"Go to Gnisis with you? A slaughterfish? Ha! Hmmm...maybe I should follow you. That way I can keep my eye on you."</i></dd>

I'd like to reward you for your generosity. I have very little, but please take this gold. Even during all my days in the legion, I've never felt anything so strange. I'll make sure to mention to my Legion friends how helpful you were. Thank you again. If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask."</i><br/>
