<p><i>"Hello, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>. The Archcanon has announced that Lord Vivec has selected you as a champion of the Temple in the war against Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House. It's very confusing. But we have faith in Lord Vivec, and we will pray for your quest. Can I help you? Are you looking for someone in particular? Do you need services? Is there some specific place you'd like to visit? Did you want to know about my trade?"</i>

<dd><b>inside the Ghostfence</b> <i>"All our intelligence is old. No one has ventured inside the fence for years. This map shows the locations of the citadels of the various ash vampires. Sixth House creatures have become more numerous and powerful, and the most powerful can conjure powerful daedra. Until recently, we've been able to clear routes and keep them clean with raids, but no longer. There are no safe refuges or services inside the fence; you must return here to rest and heal."</i></dd></dl>
