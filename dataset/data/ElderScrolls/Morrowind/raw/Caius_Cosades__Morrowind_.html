<dl><dd><b>Caius Cosades</b> <i>"I'm just an old man with a skooma problem."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Report to Caius Cosades</b> <i>"So. You say your name is </i><span class="caption"><i>Nerevarine</i><span> (Player name)</span></span><i>, and you have been told to report to me and deliver a package. Perhaps you'll let me look at it?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Yes</b> <i>"Yes. Very interesting. So. It says here the Emperor wants me to make you a Novice in the Blades. And that means you'll be following my <b>orders</b>. Are you ready to follow my orders, </i><span class="caption"><i>Nerevarine</i><span> (Player name)</span></span><i>?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Yes</b> <i>"Good. Welcome to the service, Novice </i><span class="caption"><i>Nerevarine</i><span> (Player name)</span></span><i>. Now you belong to the Blades. We're the Emperor's eyes and ears in the provinces. You can use my bed if you need to rest, but leave my personal stuff alone unless I say otherwise. If you like, you can improve your modest skills with our <b>Blades Trainers</b> now. Or if you're in a hurry. I can give you <b>orders</b> right away. But don't forget to visit the Blades Trainers."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Orders</b> <i>"First thing, pilgrim. You're new. And you look it. Here's 200 drakes. Go get yourself a decent weapon. Or armor. Or a spell. And second thing... you need a cover identity. Around here, 'freelance adventurer' is a common profession. Sign on with the <b>Fighters Guild</b>, or <b>Mages Guild</b>, or <b>Imperial cult</b>, or <b>Imperial legion</b>, advance in the ranks, gain skill and experience. Or go out on your own, look for <b>freelance work</b>, or trouble. Then, when you're ready, come back, and I'll have orders for you."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Fighters Guild</b> <i>"The Fighters Guild is a professional organization chartered by the Emperor to regulate the hiring and training of mercenaries. Training, goods, and services are cheaper for members, and the Guild Stewards know where to find work. You'll have to start your service with Eydis Fire-Eye, the Balmora Guild Steward. She's new, and I don't know her well. Percius Mercius, the Ald'ruhn Guild Steward, I know and trust, but he only handles higher-ranking assignments."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Mages Guild</b> <i>"It's a guild for the arcane arts. And it's where you go to find wizards for hire. Training, goods, and services are cheaper for members, and the Guild Stewards know where to find work. If you want to be a wizard, join and work your way up the ranks. The Mages Guild here is better than the Fighters Guild. Ranis Athrys is the guild steward, so talk to her if you want to join up. She's got a chip on her soldier, but here apprentice, Ajira, seems okay for a Khajiit."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Imperial cult</b> <i>"The Imperial cult worships the Nine Divines: the Aedra Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, and Julianos, and Tiber Septim, founder and patron of the Empire. In Morrowind, it's partly maintaining the faith for outlanders like us, and partly a missionary cult, bringing enlightment to the heathen Dunmer. You can see Somutis Vunnis at <b>Fort Moonmoth</b> to join, but you have to go to Ebonheart if you want to become a <b>lay servant</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Fort Moonmoth</b> <i>"Moonmoth Fort is the Imperial Legion garrison southeast of Balmora, just outside of town. Radd Hard-Heart is the Knight in charge. Between the Imperial Legions and Imperial cult staff, they have about a dozen service providers out there."</i></dd>
<dd><b>lay servant</b> <i>"Lay servant serve the Imperial cult by doing various tasks. Not a lot of excitement, but safe, honorable, and rewarding. First you have to join the Imperial cult, then go to the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart to get work. See Synnolian Tunifus to become a lay healer. See Iulus Truptor to become an almoner -- a fund raiser. See Kaye to become a shrine sergeant -- they do the more dangerous jobs."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Imperial Legion</b> <i>"The Imperial Legion has several fort garrisons here on Vvardenfell. The lower ranks handle law enforcement, escorts, rescues, dangerous predators, diseased and blighted beasts, and so forth. Only one fort accepts recruits -- Fort Darius in Gnisis. Gnisis is a frontier outpost, isolated, a little rough. But good experience. If you're interested, see General Darius in Gnisis."</i></dd>
<dd><b>freelance work</b> <i>"You can always just wander around and ask for work. Hunt monsters and sell their hides. Collect ingredients for alchemists. Prey on bandits and smugglers. Search ruins for loot. All you need are better skills and conditioning, and knowledge of Morrowind. And spend what you earn on equipment and training. Then come back a little less wet-behind-the-ears, and I won't have to worry so much about you when I send you out on a mission."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Blades Trainers</b> <i>"These <b>Blades</b> agents off training... not free, of course, but cheap for a fellow agent. Look for <b>Rithleen</b>, <b>Tyermaillin</b>, and <b>Nine-Toes</b> here in Balmora. In Caldera, see <b>Surane Leoriane</b>. In Ald'ruhn, see <b>Gildan</b>, <b>Sjorvar Hore-Mouth</b> lives in a hut west of Ald'ruhn, And <b>Elone</b> the Scout can be found at Arrille's Tradehouse in Seyda Neen."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Blades</b> <i>"We're spies. We're the Emperors hidden eyes and ears in the provinces. We watch the Emperor's enemies. We look for opportunities. We make repots. And, when the Emperor commands, we obey. But we're only one of many <b>guilds and factions</b> in Morrowind. You should know a little about Morrowind politics before you get involved with any of these other groups."</i>
<dl><dd><b>guilds and factions</b> <i>"Groups favoring Imperial interests are the Blades, the Imperial cult, the Imperial Legion, the Fighters Guild, the Mages Guild, and the Thieves Guild. Groups favoring native Dunmer interests are House Redoran, House Hlaalu, and House Telvanni, the Temple, the Morag Tong, the Camonna Tong, and the Ashlanders."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Rithleen</b> <i>"Warrior Rithleen lives two houses south, upstairs."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Tyermaillin</b> <i>"Healer Tyermaillin lives two houses south, downstairs."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Nine-Toes</b> <i>"To get to Hunter Nine-Toes, leave my door facing south. Go right, down the steps, then turn left and head south, looking for his door on your left."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Surane Leoriane</b> <i>"Mage Surane Leoriane is in Caldera, the next town north. Her half-timber-and-stone house north sits between the twin towers of the North Gate and the Governor's Hall."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Gildan</b> <i>"Nightblade Gildan lives in Ald'ruhn, the Redoran district seat north of here, beyond Caldera. Gildan is in the southeast corner of town, in a house to the right of the steps up to the <b>temple</b>."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Sjorvar Horse-Mouth</b> <i>"Master-at-Arms Sjorvar Horse-Mouth lives in a guar herder's hut in the middle of nowhere west of Caldera. I've only been there once, and couldn't give you the directions. Go look for him if you feel like a little hike."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Elone</b> <i>"Elone the Scout cam usually be found at Arrille's Tradehouse in Seyda Neen. You know where that is. You arrived in Seyda Neen by boat."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

Then get the information from Antabolis and report back to me. By the way... Hasphat is a student of <b>Morrowind history</b>. Take the chance to get a little education.

<dd><b>Nerevarine</b> <i>"Some Dunmer believe that an orphan and outcast, a youth born on a certain day to uncertain parents, will one day unite all the tribes of the Dunmer, drive out the invaders of Morrowind, and reestablish the ancient laws and customs of the Dark Elvven nations. They call this orphan and outcast the "Nerevarine," and say the Nerevarine will be a reincarnation of the long-dead Dunmer General and First Councilor, Lord Indoril Nerevar."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Sixth House</b> <i>"A trusted informant says they're a secret cult associated with some strange events recently, and, more important, my informant thinks these recent disturbances are related in some way to the <b>Nerevarine Prophecies</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> <i>"The illiterate <b>Ashlanders</b> pass down their customs and history in the form of poetic verses. Among the things they preserve in verse are the dreams and prophetic visions of their wise women, in particular the verses that foretell the coming of the Nerevarine. But I don't know much about it. That's why I'm sending you to find out."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Ashlanders</b> <i>"I don't know much about the Ashlanders. Most people say they are murderous savages, but most people are idiots. I know they hate their settled Dunmer cousins almost as much as they hate Westerners. They must be tough to live in the Ashlands. I don't think outlanders can become members of the tribes. I don't know why anyone would want to."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd><b>Sharn gra-Muzgob</b> <i>"Very smart. For an Orc. An unhealthy interest in the dark arts, perhaps, but very smart. She's always worried that the <b>Temple</b> will bust in and stick her in a fire. And worried with good reason."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Temple</b> <i>"The Tribunal Temple is the native religion. They worship three God-Kings, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec, who are known together as the Tribunal. We usually just call it 'The Temple.' They're narrow-minded and superstitious, but I find a lot to admire -- particularly their concern for the poor.

So you could satisy the conditions of the Nerevarine prophecies and become the <b>Nerevarine</b>. Here. This is a decoded copy of the coded package you gave me when you arrived. Read it later.

Do you REALLY satisfy the prophecy? Are you REALLY the prophesied Nerevarine? At first, I thought you were supposed to create a persuasive imposter. Now I don't know what to think. But I am sure of one thing. This is not just primitive superstition, and we will treat it seriously, just as his Majesty commands. So. Zainsubani says Sul-Matuul and Nibani Maesa at Urshilaku camp are the heads of the Nerevarine cult. So I'm sending you to speak with them. Tell them your story, and have them test you against the Nerevarine prophecies. As heads of the Nerevarine cult, they can best judge whether you satisfy the prophecies.

<dl><dd><b>Orders</b> <i>"With Dagoth Gares dead, the Sixth House shrine is no longer a threat. You've more than earned a promotion to the rank of Traveler. I'm very worried that you have <b>corprus disease</b>. But I have some good news in that department. I canvassed my informants for possible treatments, just in case you contracted the disease during your mission. I learned from <b>Fast Eddie</b> that your best chance of getting cured is Divayth Fyr, an ancient Telvanni wizard who runs a <b>Corprusarium</b> for victims of the disease. Here. Take this <b>Dwemer artifact</b> and 1000 drakes, and go to <b>Tel Fyr</b>. Divayth Fyr will like the Dwemer Artifact. A gift may sweeten his disposition. The gold is for expenses. And here's a couple of Levitation potions. I hear you'll need them in Telvanni towers, because wizards don't use stairs. So get moving, and get that corprus disease cured. Then hurry back. I think I know how to get the lost prophecies Nibani Maesa asked for."</i>
<dl><dd><b>corprus disease</b> <i>"You have corprus disease. It's a rare disease that usally drives victims mad, and causes terrible, deformed growths on the body. I don't know much about it. I'll check my informants, and see how to cure it. In the meantime, we can discuss your orders."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Fast Eddie</b> <i>"Edd Theman, also 'Fast Eddia', also 'Eddie the Rat', is a rare commodity, a former Telvanni wizard who has gone Imperial and joined the Mages Guild. A colorful but unreliable character, but he is an invaluable source of inside information on Great House Telvanni. He has a small house here in Balmora."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Corprusarium</b> <i>"The Temple sends victims of corprus disease to the Corprusarium. The Corprusarium is beneath Tel Fyr, the tower of the Telvanni wizard Divayth Fyr. I asked Fast Eddie what it was like. 'It's a swell place. Full of doomed crazy people with bloated bodies. You'll love it.'"</i></dd>
<dd><b>Dwemer artifact</b> <i>"Fast Eddie says Divayth Fyr collects Dwemer artifacts. Yes, I know it's treason to trade in Dwemer artifacts, but don't worry about it. I'm a big-shot Imperial Spymaster, remember? And, yes, it's worth a fortune. But you're worth it. The cash is for expenses, and just in case. Good luck."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Tel Fyr</b> <i>"Tel Fyr, Divayth Fyr's tower, is southwest of Sadrith Mora, on an island on the southwestern edge of Zafirbel Bay. Here. Let me mark it on your map. There's a dock, but no boat service, so you must water-walk or swim from Sadrith Mora. Use the <b>Guild Guide</b> service at the Balmora Mages Guild to reach Sadrith Mora. At Sadrith Mora, find Wolverine Hall, Fighters Guild, and ask the scout Sondryn Irathi for detailed directions to Tel Fyr."</i>
<dl><dd><b>guild guide</b> <i>"A guild guide is a spellcaster of the Mages Guild who provides magical transport for a small fee. You can only travel from one Mages Guild to another, but it is the fastest way to travel between Vivec, Balmora, Ald'ruhn, Caldera, and Sadrith Mora."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I've only waited here to give you your final orders before I go."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>recalled</b> <i>"Internal politics. Some concern about my sugar. I thought about refusing the recall. But they have members of my family back in the capital. I'm afraid it may have something to do with the problems with the succession. As the Emperor's health declines, factions are maneuvering for advantage. I may be gone a while -- that's why you're promoted to Operative."</i></dd>
<dd><b>promoted to Operative</b> <i>"That makes you the ranking Blades agent here in Vvardenfell district. As far as I know. There may be other Blades agents here I don't know about. It wouldn't surprise me. I may be gone a while, and you'll have expenses. Here's some gold. And you can use the house until I return. And I won't be needing these blacks or the ring while I'm in Cyrodiil. Maybe they'll come in handy. Take good care of them."</i>
<dl><dd><b>promoted to Operative</b> <i>"Yes. That makes you the ranking Blades agent here in Vvardenfell district while I'm gone. And I may be gone a while."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>head the Blades</b> <i>"There's nothing to it. Each agent has his own assignment, and reports directly to Cyrodiil. You're promoted to Operative mostly to preserve your independence. You're no fool. The days of the Empire are almost over. When the Emperor dies, nine hells're going to break loose. Forget about the Imperial City. Think locally. Worry about the Sixth House and Dagoth Ur. And squabbles between the Great Houses and the colonists. The rest of the political nonsense doesn't amount to a plate of scuttle."</i></dd>
