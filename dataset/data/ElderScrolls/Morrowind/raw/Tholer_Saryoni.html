<dl><dd><b>Temple's doctrine</b> <i>"The Temple must protect the people from false doctrines. And your association with Imperial intelligence makes your motivations and integrity suspect. But you have been chosen Hortator and Nerevarine by the Dunmer people. And we have reached a crisis with Dagoth Ur. We can no longer defend the people against the awakened Sixth House. You and your prophecies may represent our last hope. Our situation is desperate. But I would rather have you hear the details of our situation, and the circumstances leading up to that situation, from Lord Vivec himself. He has asked to see you. Would you agree to a private meeting with him, and hear in person what he has to say?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Yes, I will meet with Vivec</b> <i>"Good. Here are two keys: one to the private back entrance to my quarters, the other to a locked entrance to Lord Vivec's palace. I regret that, at present, the Ordinators are not completely under my control, so, for now, I'll ask you to avoid confrontations with them. Lord Vivec is expecting you. His Lordship is remarkably patient, but perhaps it would be better not to keep him waiting."</i>

<dd><b>No, I don't trust you</b> <i>"I'm sorry. I understand. Then we have nothing further to discuss at this time. I will not apologize for the Temple's actions against you, or against the Dissident Priests. But I do believe it is time for such hostilities to stop. I regret that, at present, the Ordinators are not completely under my control, so I cannot guarantee that you will not be harmed. But if you change your mind, and are willing to meet with Vivec, please return to me at any time."</i></dd></dl></dd>
