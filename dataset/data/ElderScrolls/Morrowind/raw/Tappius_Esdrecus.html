<p><i>"Greetings, citizen. I'm Tappius Esdrecus. Welcome to <b>Balmora</b>. We're a House Hlaalu town, and loyal <b>citizens of the Empire</b>. What can I do for you?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Balmora</b> <i>"Balmora is the Council Seat of Great House Hlaalu, and the largest town on Vvardenfell except for Vivec City. Located on the Odai River, and sitting astride the Ald'ruhn-Vivec road, Balmora is an important mercantile trade and travel center. High Town is the administrative center, with the Temple and manor houses. The shops, guilds, and tradehouses of the Commercial District are north of the river; Labor Town's modest cornerclubs and homes are south of the river."</i></dd>
<dd><b>citizens of the Empire</b> <i>"We've had peace and prosperity in Morrowind under the Empire for centuries. It's a government by law, and the Legions enforce that law. The Empire has free trade and free religion, so we're rich in pockets and in spirit. Yes, there is corruption. Yes, there are crimes and criminals. Yes, the rich get richer, and the poor poorer. But overall, things are pretty good."</i></dd></dl>
