If you can return my goods, and kill those bastards who took them, I'd be willing to teach you a couple trader's secrets that could save you plenty of money in the future. My "guards," Alvur Hleran and Dondir, probably haven't gone far. Stupid fetchers are probably holed up somewhere near here, counting my loot! Check to the southeast. That's the direction they headed."</i>
