<dl><dd><b>Dagoth Ur</b> <i>"He is the Lord and Father of the Mountain. He sleeps, but when he wakes, we shall rise from our dreams, shall sweep our land clean of the n'wah. Why have you denied him? As Lord Dagoth has said, 'All shall greet him as flesh, or as dust.'"</i></dd>

Take heed, out-lander. The day of reckoning is at hand. Take what you can, and leave our place, for when Lord Dagoth comes, this will be no place for you."</i></dd></dl>
