<dl><dd><b>Hortator and Nerevarine</b> <i>"Dunmer of the Ashlands and Dunmer of the Houses have traditions of a War Leader set over all the tribes in times of need. First, your task is to prove to them their need. Then you must prove that you should be their war leader -- the Nerevarine, for Ashlanders; the Hortator, for the Great Houses."</i>
<dl><dd><b>War Leader</b> <i>"To prove to them your fitness as War Leader to the Dunmer people, you must demonstrate your might in battle, your honor in speech, and your wisdom in leadership."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><i>"To show them their need, you must tell them about the Tribunal, how they have adopted the profane tools of the Dwarves, how they have betrayed and misled their people -- and give them proofs. You must tell them about Dagoth Ur, and the Sixth House, about their powers and plans, and how the Tribunal no longer has power to contain them."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Background</b> <i>"I am Peakstar. I was called to the prophecies, but I was not the one."</i></dd>

<dl><dd><b>Moon-and-Star</b> <i>"You bear the Moon-and-Star, the ring of <a href="/wiki/Indoril_Nerevar" title="Indoril Nerevar">Nerevar</a>. None may deny; you ARE Nerevar Reborn, the prophesied Incarnate. The <a href="/wiki/Tribunal_Temple" title="Tribunal Temple">Temple</a> will know you as an enemy. <a href="/wiki/Ordinator_(Morrowind)" title="Ordinator (Morrowind)">Ordinators</a> will mark you for death, and the Tribunal Faithful of the Great Houses will hate and fear you.

<dd><b>Hortator</b> <i>"You must go before the Councilors of the Great Houses and satisfy them, for only the Councils of the Great Houses can name you 'Hortator.' I do not know the settled people of the Great Houses, and can offer you no counsel."</i></dd>

All they do, all they are is foul and evil, but they began in brightness and honor, and the cause of their fall was their loyal service to you, Lord Nerevar. You told Lord Dagoth to guard the <b>profane tools</b> beneath <a href="/wiki/Red_Mountain" title="Red Mountain">Red Mountain</a>, and thus he was tempted. He did your bidding when he tried to keep these tools from the Tribunal, and so he hates you, who betrayed him, and the Tribunal, who mocked his honor, attacked him, and stole the profane tools for their own use."</i>
<dl><dd><b>profane tools</b> <i>"<a href="/wiki/Kagrenac" title="Kagrenac">Kagrenac</a>, high priest of the <a href="/wiki/Dwemer" title="Dwemer">Dwemer</a>, forged enchanted artifacts to steal the power of the gods. Nerevar fought the Dwemer to prevent this blasphemy. But Dagoth Ur took these tools to make himself a god. And the Tribunal took these tools to make themselves gods. Though the Tribunal sought to do good with their power, they are tainted by the same corrupt desires that move Dagoth Ur."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>False Gods</b> <i>"The <a href="/wiki/Tribunal" title="Tribunal">Tribunal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dagoth_Ur_(Character)" title="Dagoth Ur (Character)">Dagoth Ur</a> have the unnatural abilities and lifespans of gods.

<dd><b>not the one</b> <i>"I am a failed Incarnate. So are all these who remain here with me in the Cavern of the Incarnate. I survived the blight, but I fell in battle with an Ash Vampire.

<dd><b>wisdom guides me</b> <i>"I will answer when I can, and with what I know. But the visions of <a href="/wiki/Azura" title="Azura">Azura</a> are often obscure, for two reasons. One, because the future cannot be known, and choices may always be made. Two, because truth is not clear or simple. Azura's riddles warn us to think long and hard. They force us to search carefully for truth and meaning, and not to rely only on impulse and force."'</i></dd></dl>
