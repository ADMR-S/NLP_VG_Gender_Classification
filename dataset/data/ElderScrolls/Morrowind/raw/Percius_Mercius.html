I hesitate to suggest this, but if you can't convince him, Hrundi has a lover. A Dunmer from what I hear. If you find her, you can convince Hrundi to join your cause. Eydis Fire-Eye is a good fighter, but there's always been something dark about her. I found out just recently what that was. She's a worshipper of Clavicus Vile. I don't know how you can use this information. I'm sure she can't be blackmailed. The new Master of the Fighters Guild is Sjoring Hard-Heart. He owers too much Camonna Tong gold to back out now. There's no way you can convince him. You'll have to kill him."</i></dd></dl>
