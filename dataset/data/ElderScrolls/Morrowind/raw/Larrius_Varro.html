<dl><dd><b>work</b> <i>"Through various channels, I've learned a bit about your situation. I'd like to tell you a <b>little story</b>. And when I'm done, you can ask me some questions. And then, maybe, you might decide to go out and do some things. You might, and you might not. That's your affair. And I also want to tell you about a <b>nice present</b> I think the Emperor wants you to have. I'm not sure where it is. But maybe you'll want to check back and see if I've found it. Later. After you have done some things."</i>
<dl><dd><b>little story</b> <i>"Once upon a time there was a bad magistrate who took gold from criminal organizations to reduce the sentences and fines of criminals. Everybody knew he was doing this, but nobody could prove it. Because even if it could be proved, the bad magistrate had important friends, and proof is not as powerful as important friends. At the same time there was a good officer who enforced the laws because he thought laws made people happy and safe. And it bothered the good officer that enforcing the laws did no good, because the bad magistrate let the criminals go as quick as the officer caught them. For a long time, the good officer sighed, and said, 'What can I do? Because the bad magistrate has important friends, and nothing I can do will touch him.' But then, the good officer said, 'Say. Wait a minute. What about the <b>bad people</b> who are BRIBING the bad magistrate? THEY haven't got important friends. And if they aren't around, then the bad magistrate can't get any more bribes. And even better, the good officer suspected that the bad people who were bribing the bad magistrate were probably criminals themselves. So the good officer decided that it would be good if the bad people who were bribing the bad magistrate should go away. Forever. So that good officer made a little special prayer that there would be a little <b>bloodbath</b> to wash the bad people away. There. Isn't that a nice little story? Maybe not a perfect story. Because it ends with a prayer, and not a bloodbath. But maybe the story isn't over yet."</i></dd>
<dd><b>nice present</b> <i>"What is the nice present from the Emperor? I'm sure I don't know. I think it is supposed to be a surprise. And, as I said, I'm not sure where it is. But I might find it. Any time. So check back and see if I've found it. Later. After you have done some work."</i>
<dl><dd><b>bad people</b> <i>"<span class="caption">Oh. The bad people are the Camonna Tong. I thought everybody knew that. They are a criminal organization. Unfortunately, I don't know who the Camonna Tong are. No one will tell me, because I am an officer. And it is against the Code to tell officers things. But people in the <b>Thieves Guild</b> hate the Camonna Tong. I bet if YOU asked the Thieves Guild, they would cheerfully tell you who the bad people are and where to find them.<span> (Or "Oh.

<dl><dd><b>Thieves Guild</b> <i>"In the Empire, the Thieves Guild is old and powerful, but here in Morrowind, the Thieves Guild is young and weak. The old and powerful criminal guild of Morrowind is the Camonna Tong. The Camonna Tong doesn't like the Thieves Guild. A lot. And the feeling is mutual."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>bloodbath</b> <i>"The bad people in my story are five members of the Camonna Tong. I know they are a scout, a pawnbroker, a savant, a thief, and a smith, and that they are in Balmora. Unfortunately, I don't know their names. But maybe you can find their names. And where to find them. And then maybe my story could have a happy ending. With a little bloodbath, instead of a little prayer."</i>
<dl><dd><b>bloodbath</b> <i>"Here's what I'm thinking. I love the law. I love the Empire. I love the people I try very hard to keep safe. But sometimes, no matter how hard we try to keep the peace, sometimes there is going to be blood. I think you know what I'm talking about. That's why I asked for you to do this bit of work. If you're willing."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
