<p><i>"Hello. They call me <b>Wulf</b>. What brings you to <b>Ghostgate</b>?"</i>

<dl><dd><b>Wulf</b> <i>"Wulf. That's me."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ghostgate</b> <i>"This is a helluva place. Why are you here?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Perhaps I should keep my business here secret.</b> <i>"Suit yourself. I don't know why you'd bother to keep anything a secret here. I was just wondering if you might be headed inside the Ghostfence to Dagoth Ur."</i></dd>
<dd><b>I am the Nerevarine, and I go to confront Dagoth Ur in his citadel.</b> <i>"What a piece of luck! Look. I'm an old Legion veteran, as old as the <b>poor old Emperor</b>, bless his soul. I'm too old for campaigning. I came this far to look at hell. But I can't go any farther than this. I'd take it kindly if you'd carry this old lucky coin with you when you go to Dagoth Ur. Sort of a token of the tough young hero I used to be. Would you do that for an old man?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>I'm sorry, but my mother told me never to accept gifts from strangers.</b> <i>"You're a suspicious sort. But maybe I can't blame you. Worried about a request from a strange old man in a strange place like this. Well, I won't press you. But I would sure be grateful for the favor, if you could see your way to changing your mind."</i></dd>
<dd><b>I'll take your old lucky coin to Dagoth Ur with me.</b> <i>"That's very kind of you. Here's the coin. I've had it with me a long time, and it's always brought me luck. But I have no more use for it, and I'd like to pass it on to somebody younger. Somebody going places I can't go anymore. Your generation's shaper of history... an engine of destiny. That coin will bring you luck on the mountain. I promise. 'For Emperor and Empire,' as we say in the legions. Go with Kynareth."</i>
<dl><dd><b>poor old Emperor:</b> <i>"<a href="/wiki/Uriel_Septim_VII" title="Uriel Septim VII">The Emperor</a> is getting old. Don't know how much longer he'll hang on. So is the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Septim_Empire" title="Septim Empire">whole Empire</a>, for that matter. Getting old, that is. The Emperor and the legions have held the Empire together for hundreds of years. It's been a good thing, by and large. But maybe it's time for a change. Time for something young and new. What? No idea. Because I'm old. Old dog doesn't get new ideas. But maybe young folks like you should try some new ideas. I don't know. Could be messy. But change is never pretty."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
