<dl><dd><b>Latest rumors</b> <i>"At first, it seemed the fuss about the <b>Nerevarine</b> prophecy was just silly superstition. Then I learned that the Dunmer have been waiting for Lord Nerevar to come back for centuries. The 'Incarnate', they call it. Every few years an Ashlander appears, and the tribes call him the Incarnate. Then the Temple goes out, hunts him down, and reveals him as a fake. Why does the Temple worry so much about it?"</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>Nerevarine</b> <i>"It's the reincarnation of some Dark Elven hero, supposed to come and drive the Empire out of Morrowind. Just some local superstition... but the Temple says it's wicked and evil, and you'll be very sorry if you talk about it with the priests and Temple <b>guard</b>."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
