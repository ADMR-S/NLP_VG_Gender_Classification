<p><b>Vampires:</b>Â  <i>"We are the dark walkers, those who prey on the warm blooded. Our gifts are many, and weaknesses few. There are three major clans: Aundae, Berne, and Quarra. There are others in this world as well, living like cattle in tombs under the ground."</i>
</p><p><b>Aundae:</b> <i>"Weak, pathetic creatures. They use their powerful magic as a crutch, never experiencing the joy the dark gift brings--the sheer physical power we are given."</i>
</p><p><b>Berne:</b> <i>"They are not unlike us in many ways. But, though gifted physically, they prefer the shadows, stalking their prey from the darkness. It is cowardly and weak, and they are not to be trusted."</i>
</p><p><b>Quarra:</b> <i>"Above all clans, we stand alone! We have few limitations to our power, so great is our gift. Our dark powers make us prefect predators, perfect warriors. Those who live in the sunlight fear our name."</i>
</p><p><b>Limitations to our power:</b> <i>"We are shunned by almost all who live in the sunlight. While some mages will tolerate us, all others consider us abominations. And the sunlight...do not walk in the sunlight. It will be your death."</i>
</p><p><b>Our dark powers:</b> <i>"As a Quarra, you are gifted above all. Your strength and fighting skills are unmatched by any. Throw away your armor and weapons, for so great is our skill, that they are unneeded."</i>
