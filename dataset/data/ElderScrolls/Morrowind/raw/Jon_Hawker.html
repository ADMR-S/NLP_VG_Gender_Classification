<p><i>"Praise the Nine! Have you come to my rescue? I was seeking trade oppurtunities with the Ashlanders when I was attacked by outcast outlanders. I was seprarated from my bodyguard, and took refuge in this cave, where I was seized, robbed, and held by this battlemage, <b><a href="/wiki/Galmis_Dren" title="Galmis Dren">Galmis Dren</a></b>, to be sold as a slave. I prayed to Zenithar for <b><a href="/wiki/Divine_Intervention_(Morrowind)" title="Divine Intervention (Morrowind)">Divine Intervention</a></b>. You must have been sent in answer to my prayers."</i>

<dl><dd><b>Galmis Dren</b> <i>"I warn you. He is a skilled battlemage, well-armed, well-armored, and dark in the Craft. Take care with him."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Divine Intervention</b> <i>"Lucky for me you came prepared -- not just for yourself, but for others. Don't worry about my stuff -- it wasn't worth anything. I just want out of here. Give me that scroll, and I'm free."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Give Divine Intervention scroll.</b> <i>"Thank you, friend. And goodbye. But before I go, let me give you a gift. They took everything, but I managed to keep these gloves hidden. I've always been found of them, and their maker. Wear them in good health, and in remembrance of me."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Keep Divine Intervention scroll.</b> <i>"Just my luck. In answer to my prayers, the Nine send me a tight-wad hero. The gods have a funny sense of humor."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
