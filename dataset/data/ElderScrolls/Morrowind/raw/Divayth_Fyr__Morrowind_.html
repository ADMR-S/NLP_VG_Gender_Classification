<p><b>Greetings</b>
</p>
<ul><li>(Disposition over 50) <i>"Well! What a pleasure! A visitor! An entertaining diversion! Come to consult the great Divayth Fyr? You have the divine disease? Want to plunder the dungeon? Or leer at my daughters?"</i></li>
<li>(Disposition over 50) <i>"You again? A surprise, and a pleasure! Didn't we have a satisfactory chat? Something else you want to know about the divine disease? Eager to plunder the dungeon? Questions about my daughters?"</i></li>
<li>(Disposition over 50) <i>"Yes, yes, %PCName. You're completely cured. Did you forget something?"</i></li>
<li>(Disposition over 50) <i>"Hello, %PCName. How are you doing? Bit of bad news, I'm afraid. The potion doesn't seem to work on others. Tried it on two hopeless cases. Killed them outright. Deader than a garlic snail. But is there anything I can help you with?"</i></li>
<li><i>"I am surprised. And a bit disappointed. I thought you were the <a href="/wiki/Nerevarine" title="Nerevarine">Nerevarine</a>? Why haven't you fulfilled the prophecies? Is something wrong? Did you do something you shouldn't? I've heard rumors that Archcanon <a href="/wiki/Tholer_Saryoni" title="Tholer Saryoni">Tholer Saryoni</a>, the high priest of the Temple, is desperate, and that he asks that you come speak with him at the <a href="/wiki/High_Fane" title="High Fane">High Fane</a> in <a href="/wiki/Vivec_City_(Morrowind)" title="Vivec City (Morrowind)">Vivec City</a>. If there is some problem, maybe you should go talk to Saryoni."</i></li>
<li>(Disposition under 50) <i>"Listen. You are not interesting. No offense, but I don't want to talk to you."</i></li>
<li>(If you have killed a <a href="/wiki/Corprusarium" title="Corprusarium">Corprusarium</a> inmate) <i>"You have killed one of the inmates. I cannot forget what you've done. But I will forgive you."</i></li>
<li>(If you have killed <a href="/wiki/Yagrum_Bagarn_(Morrowind)" title="Yagrum Bagarn (Morrowind)">Yagrum Bagarn</a>) <i>"You have killed someone dear to me. It is a mistake you will not live to regret."</i> (Will turn hostile)</li>
<li>(<a href="/wiki/Dwemer_Coherer" title="Dwemer Coherer">Dwemer Coherer</a> in inventory) <i>"Say. That's an interesting Dwemer piece you have there. What can you tell me about it?"</i>
<ul><li><b>Offer the Dwemer artifact as a gift.</b> <i>[Dwemer Coherer has been removed from your inventory.] "A gift? For me? How thoughtful. And shrewd. I suppose you know I am a collector. And that such a gift is bound to please me. I congratulate you on your diplomatic skills. So, why have you tried to butter me up? Come to consult the great Divayth Fyr? You have the divine disease? Want to plunder the dungeon? Or leer at my daughters?"</i></li>
<li><b>Politely show him the piece, then put it away.</b> <i>"A pity. I can see why you'd want to keep such a lovely relic of Dwemer culture. But now, if you'll excuse me, I have no time for idle chatter."</i></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b>Corprusarium</b> <i>"I collect victims of the divine disease in my Corprusarium in the caverns beneath my tower. Poor devils. Wretched existence. Constant pain. Ferocious appetites and passions. No reason at all. Mad as marsh rats. But marvelous, too, in their way. Completely immune to disease. Live forever, barring accidents. Ancient wizards need projects to keep them occupied, and the Corprusarium is mine."</i>
</p><p><b>Daughters</b> <i>"Not bad for someone born in a jar, eh? Charming and talented. Not daughters, really. A little project, a side benefit of my researches into corprus disease. Made them myself, from my own flesh. Nice, aren't they? <a href="/wiki/Alfe_Fyr_(Morrowind)" title="Alfe Fyr (Morrowind)">Alfe Fyr</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beyte_Fyr_(Morrowind)" title="Beyte Fyr (Morrowind)">Beyte Fyr</a>, <a href="/wiki/Delte_Fyr_(Morrowind)" title="Delte Fyr (Morrowind)">Delte Fyr</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Uupse_Fyr_(Morrowind)" title="Uupse Fyr (Morrowind)">Uupse Fyr</a>. Quite a comfort to me in my old age. Hah hah."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Alfe Fyr</b> <i>"Alfe Fyr is the sharpest of my girls, in wit and tongue. Gets on my nerves, sometimes, but conflict is the spice of life."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Beyte Fyr</b> <i>"Beyte Fyr is the sweet one. Eager to please, and be pleased. An excellent cook, and a lovely singing voice."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Delte Fyr</b> <i>"Delte Fyr is the efficient one. Organized and orderly. She acts as our steward, manages accounts, maintains supplies, keeps the tower and Corprusarium running."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Uupse Fyr</b> <i>"Uupse Fyr is the girl with the biggest heart. She takes care of the inmates of the Corprusarium, and helps with my researches."</i></dd></dl>
<p><b>Dwemer piece</b> (If you didn't give him the Dwemer Coherer in his greeting) <i>"Oh, yes. I know. You have an interesting Dwemer piece. So what?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Offer the Dwemer artifact as a gift.</b> <i>[Dwemer Coherer has been removed from your inventory.] "A gift? For me? How thoughtful. And shrewd. I suppose you know I am a collector. And that such a gift is bound to please me. I congratulate you on your diplomatic skills. So, why have you tried to butter me up? Come to consult the great Divayth Fyr? You have the divine disease? Want to plunder the dungeon? Or leer at my daughters?"</i></dd>
<dd>(After giving him the artifact) <i>"Thank you for your gift."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Politely show him the piece, then out it away.</b> [Disposition -10.] <i>"Are you trying to provoke me? Surely you know I prize and collect such things. It is rude to stimulate my appetites by displaying such things. And I don't have to be polite to rude people."</i></dd></dl>
<p><b>Egg of Time</b> <i>"This is an interesting work. Yagrum Bagarn might be able to tell you more."</i>
</p><p><b>Plunder the dungeon</b> <i>"When you live for thousands of years, you need a hobby. Something you love, always sparks your interest. I collect treasures, and invite thieves to steal them. I'm a collector, and a sportsman. I collect enchanted items and ancient artifacts. Have quite a few Dwemer pieces. And, as a sportsman, I love letting thieves try to steal my well-guarded treasures. Only a few rules. One, don't hurt the inmates. Two, don't hurt my daughters. My Warden and guards can look out for themselves."</i>
</p><p><b>The divine disease</b> <i>"The magical principles of corprus disease are elusive and miraculous, far more subtle and powerful than any conventional sorcery or enchantment. I'm persuaded that it is in some manner the curse or blessing of a god. Perhaps both a curse and a blessing. The victim, of course, cannot appreciate the marvelous nature of corprus. It saps the mind and destroys the body. But to a wizard, it is a profound and glorious mystery, a riddle worth a long lifetime of study."</i>
</p><p><b>Warden</b> <i>"<a href="/wiki/Vistha-Kai" title="Vistha-Kai">Vistha-Kai</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Argonians_(Morrowind)" title="Argonians (Morrowind)">Argonian</a>, is my Warden of the Corprusarium. Quite a fighter. Tough as nails. Self-taught. Works out with my daughters, who are no slouches at the martial arts themselves. Vistha-Kai was one of the last of my slaves. Freed him, and he wouldn't leave. Kept him on as a hireling, then made him my partner. Excellent fellow. Fine companion. Not an intellectual, you understand, but good company for me and my daughters."</i>
</p><p><b>Yagrum Bagarn</b> <i>"Yagrum Bagarn is my oldest corprus victim. You'll find him in the bowels of the Corprusarium. Interesting case."</i>

</p>
<dl><dd><b>Delyna Mandas</b> <i>"Delyna Mandas? I do not recall her name. Many people try to steal from my tower or spy on me or enter the Corprusarium. I cannot be expected to keep track of them all. If you want to look for her, go right ahead."</i></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>corprus disease</b> <i>"How interesting. Did you know that corprus makes you immune to disease? Have you ever heard of the prophecies of the Nerevarine? Ashlanders say the Nerevarine will be immune to disease. I've always thought, "Maybe I have the Nerevarine down in my Corprusarium, and I don't even know it." Hah. Hah. The Nerevarine is a fat, disgusting corprus monster, and mas as a marsh rat. Wouldn't that be funny?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Explain that you may fulfill the Nerevarine prophecies.</b> <i>"That's a fascinating story you tell. So. You might be the Nerevarine. Means nothing, of course. Corprus victims have all sorts of delusions. But... let me think..."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Tell him you know nothing about the Nerevarine prophecies.</b> <i>"Nerevarine prophecies. Just Ashlander superstitions. Or maybe not. Never can tell where prophecy and Azura are concerned. Hmm. Let me think..."</i></dd>
<dd><i>"I've got a potion. In theory, it should cure corprus. Doesn't work, though. Probably kill you. Killed all my test subjects. But you've got nothing to lose. Before I give it to you, I want you to look around below in the Corprusarium. Know what's in store if you don't take the potion. And while you're there, I want you to pick up a pair of boots from a victim, calls himself Yagrum Bagarn. My oldest patient. Handy fellow, fixes things for me. Bring the boots back, and then you can have the potion."</i>
<dl><dd><b>corprus disease</b> <i>"Yes, yes. I know. You've got corprus disease. But did you get the boots I sent you to get? Because I'm not gibing you any potion until you've given me the boots."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
