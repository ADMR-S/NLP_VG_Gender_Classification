<dl><dd><b>Caldera Mining Company</b> <i>"The <b>Caldera</b> Mine Company is chartered by the Emperor to extract ebony ore from rich underground deposits here."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Caldera</b> <i>"Caldera is an <b>Imperial</b> charter town, part of the Caldera Mining Company charter, which grants the company rights to mine ebony from the right deposits here. The <b>Caldera ebony mines</b> themselves lie to the southwest. The town has a real Western flavor -- makes outlanders feel right at home. Caldera is rich, and bound to get richer, since the profits from the ebony exports continue to grow as the mine operations grow."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Caldera ebony mines</b> <i>"The Caldera ebony mines are southwest of the village of Caldera. There's an office, a bunkhouse, and guard tower over near the mine entrance. If you're thinking of taking a look while you're here, head straight west from town, then swing around south into the bowl of the mine through a gap in the mountains. Otherwise, you can try climbing straight over the ridge -- but it is too steep a climb for most."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
