<dl><dd><b>enchantment</b> <i>"Aye. A foul witch has given me some enchanted disease, leaving me rooted to this spot. She called it Witchwither. Foul temptress! I had been her escort; she was a big woman, friendly...you know. Then the damned witch ensorcelled me, leaving me at this spot, nealry naked, to display my shame to the world!
