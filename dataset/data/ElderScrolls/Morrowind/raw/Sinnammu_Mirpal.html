First, you will go to Ald Daedroth and <b>make it safe</b> for the Ahemmusa.

For them, there is only what they want, and what they see. With such carelessness, only the very strong and very lucky cultists survive, while the weak provide sport and amusement for the others. And the Spawn of Sheogorath are never twice the same, and each more terrible than the next. It is an evil cult, and dangerous."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ald Daedroth</b> <i>"The Ald Daedroth Daedric site is a shrine to Sheogorath, the Mad Lord. The surface ruins are on an island a great distance north as the racer flies."</i></dd>

When the <a href="/wiki/Tribunal" title="Tribunal">Tribunal</a> claimed to have tamed the Daedra Lords, they forbid the worship of the Bad Daedra, <a href="/wiki/Malacath" title="Malacath">Malacath</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mehrunes_Dagon" title="Mehrunes Dagon">Mehrunes Dagon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Molag_Bal" title="Molag Bal">Molag Bal</a>, and Sheogorath."</i>
