<dl><dd><b>Counsel</b> <i>"I warn you. Be wary of Ashkhan Ulath-Pal and his supporters. They all hate Outlanders, and love nothing more than to kill them and loot them.

But before anything else can be done, you must first eliminate Ulath-Pal and his supporters. Then you should come speak with me, and we will discuss further how you might be named Erabenimsun Nerevarine."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine</b> <i>"Many of our tribe believe these prophecies to be no more than foolish superstition. I do not know myself what to think."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ulath-Pal</b> <i>"Ulath-Pal is always in his yurt, protected by his bodyguard, Gulakhan Ahaz. I am just a weak woman, and I am sure you would know best, but I would kill Ahaz first, the weaker of the two, and if I had secret magics and powers, I would use them to preserve me while I defend against two enemies at once."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ahaz</b> <i>"Ahaz is Ulath-Pal's faithful bodyguard. He is not so strong or skilled as Ashu-Ahhe. But wherever you see Ulath-Pal, you will also see Ahaz. If you fight Ulath-Pal, you must also fight Ahaz."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ashu-Ahhe</b> <i>"Ashu-Ahhe is a great fighter -- the most strong and experienced of the Erabenimsun. He wears enchanted armor, and boasts that none of the Erabenimsun can defeat him -- not even Ulath-Pal."</i></dd>
<dd><b>war-loving Erabenimsun</b> <i>"Under the previous ashkhan, <b>Han-Ammu'</b>s father, Airan-Ammu, the Erabenimsun grew bold and arrogant, confident in their strength of arms. Now Ashkhan Ulath-Pal and his champions have become cruel and violent, and our people live in fear. I am of the peace-loving Erabenimsun, and I wish that Airan-Ammu's son, Han Ammu, might become our new ashkhan. But we are weak, and Han-Ammu could never challenge Ulath-Pal, let alone all his supporters."</i>
<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Han-Ammu" title="Han-Ammu">Han-Ammu</a></b> <i>"Han-Ammu is the son of our former chief, Airan-Ammu, but he is nothing like his father. His birth gives him a strong claim to lead the tribe, but of the many virtues required by an ashkhan, he lacks only three things: strength, courage, and wisdom."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>peace-loving Erabenimsun</b> <i>"I am of the peace-loving Erabenimsun. We only wish to live and hunt as we have in the past, and do not wish to anger our neighbors by raiding and warfare. But Ashkhan Ulath-Pal and his supporters are strong and sure of themselves. They have grown rich by raiding and fighting, and they will not be ruled by the counsel of their wise woman."</i></dd>

<dl><dd><b>Counsel</b> <i>"Now, with Ashkhan Ulath-Pal and his supporters dead, we may consider the <b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> and how you might be named Erabenimsun Nerevarine."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> <i>"Now, with Ulath-Pal and his supporters out of the way, it is a simple matter to be named Nerevarine of the Erabenimsun. All you need to do is persuade Gulakhan Han-Ammu to become the ashkhan of the Erabenimsun. Seek him out in his gulakyurt. Be prepared, however. Han-Ammu is not the material one would choose when looking to make an ashkhan. He may be difficult to persuade."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Counsel</b> <i>"If you hope to persuade Han-Ammu to become ashkhan, you must find some way to give him strength, willpower, and intelligence. Han-Ammu is unpopular with the tribe, and he knows it. But if he bore <b>tokens</b> recognized by all the tribe as conferring strength, willpower, and intelligence, it would give him the confidence to accept the responsibilities of tribe leadership."</i>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>tokens</b> <i>"By tokens, I mean well-known tribal heirlooms, objects of power handed down through the generations by gulakhans and ashkhans. Such tokens are marks of power and distinction, and might give Han-Ammu the abilities and confidence he needs."</i>

It was the axe that Han-Ammu's father carried when he was ashkhan, and Ulath-Pal wore it, too. Perhaps if you gave that axe to Han-Ammu, it would give him the confidence of a fighter."</i></dd>

That is an example of a token recognized by all the tribes. It was the power amulet of Sanit-Kil, a witch-warrior in service to the legendary wise woman Kinitu Nila, and Ahaz's father had it from Kinitu Nila. Perhaps if you gave that amulet to Han-Ammu, it would give him the courage of a witch-warrior."</i></dd>
