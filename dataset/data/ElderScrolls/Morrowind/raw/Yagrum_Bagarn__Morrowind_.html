<p><i>"You're here for the <b>Dwemer boots</b>. Tell my <b>gracious Keeper</b> that I have done what I could. Only a Dwemer magecrafter could have done so much. But only idiots could have created these boots. It shames <b>my race</b> that we must be judged by the works of such lack-wit blunderers."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer boots</b> <i>"Lord Fyr obtained these enchanted Dwemer boots from an unfortunate thief. And, given the quality of their craftsmanship, little wonder the fellow came to a bad end. But I can do nothing for them. The fundamental enchantment is flawed. Might as well start over again... if such a pair of boots could still be fashioned in these benighted latter days. But I have done my best. Take them to Lord Fyr, with my sincere apologies."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer boots</b> <i>"I gave you the boots. Didn't I?"</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>gracious keeper</b> <i>"I owe my life to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lord_Fyr" title="Lord Fyr">Lord Fyr</a>. He took me in when I was a mad monster, out of my mind. In time, I emerged from my dementia, and now I am quite lucid most of the time, though my body is still a grotesque and useless prison. And I still have some feeble hope of cure. Lord Fyr has tried many spells and potions. None have helped me, but neither have they harmed me. If anyone can cure this disease, Lord Fyr can."</i></dd>
<dd><b>my race</b> <i>"Once I was a Master Crafter in the service of Lord Kagrenac, chief architect of the great Second Empire freeholds, and the greatest enchanter of his time. I could not match the genius of Lord Kagrenac, but what he could envision, I and my colleagues could build. All of that is gone forever. I still retain my cunning, but my hands and eyes fail me, and my memories have long faded. My only consolation is each day to mock the gods who destroyed my race, and condemned me to this <b>bleak existence</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>bleak existence</b> <i>"Since the <b>disappearance of the Dwarves</b>, I have been alone in this world, trapped in this grim prison. I can scarcely move. And my fellow inmates are scarcely good company. The risk of corprus disease deters most visitors. But if you meet with cultivated minds undaunted by the terrors of the Corprusarium, you might mention your recent interview with the <b>Last Living Dwarf</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>disappearance of the Dwarves</b> <i>"Hmm... I cannot say what happened. I was not there to observe. I was in an Outer Realm at the time, and when I came back, my people were gone. I left Red Mountain, wandering Tamriel for years, searching our deserted colonies, looking for a survivor or an explanation. Then, a long, long time ago, I returned to Red Mountain, still looking for answers. Instead, I found corprus disease, and I have been here ever since. I have <b>theories</b>, if you are interested."</i>
<dl><dd><b>theories</b> <i>"Lord Kagrenac, the foremost arcane philosopher and magecrafter of my era, devised tools to shape mythopoeic forces, intending to transcend the limits of Dwemer mortality. However, in reviewing his formulae, some logicians argued that side effects were unpredictable, and errors might be catastrophic. I think Kagrenac might have succeeded in granting our race eternal life, with unforeseen consequences -- such as wholesale displacement to an Outer Realm. Or he may have erred, and utterly destroyed our race."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Last Living Dwarf</b> <i>"This is how I style myself. I do not know for a fact that I am the last. But in my travels thousands of years ago. I never encountered another. And since I have been here, I often ask Lord Fyr, but he says he has never heard a credible rumor of another Dwemer, on Tamriel, or in any Outer Realm."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

The Dwemer were not unified in their thinking. Kagrenac and his tonal architects, among them Bthuand Mzahnch, believed they could improve the Dwemer race. Others argued that the attempt would be too great a risk. The war with Nerevar and the Dunmer may have led Kagrenac to carry out his experiments prematurely. Although this book argues that nothing disastrous could result, the disappearance of my race argues otherwise.Â”"</i></dd></dl></dd>

Many books were written in both languages in the days of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Resdayn" title="Resdayn">Resdayn</a> when Dunmer and Dwemer ruled together peacefully. I'd offer to translate, but this is really just a boring travel guide. If you find any other books in Dwemer, I could translate them for you."</i></dd></dl>
