The two Ordinators were armed and on duty. Their weapons were still in their belts. Nothing was removed from the victim's bodies. I cannot hire you. Only Ordinators may serve the Watch. But if you can find this killer, and execute him, I personally promise you a very handsome reward. I require no commitment from you. Indeed I cannot officially accept one. But if you are interested, I can tell you what we know about the <b>seven victims</b> and the reports of <b>witnesses</b>."</i></dd>
<dd><b>seven victims</b> <i>"None of the five outlander victims had been on <a href="/wiki/Vvardenfell_(Morrowind)" title="Vvardenfell (Morrowind)">Vvardenfell</a> longer than a week. Two were found in <a href="/wiki/Vivec,_Foreign_Quarter" title="Vivec, Foreign Quarter">Foreign Quarters</a> corridors, one on Foreign Quarter Canalside, one in a <a href="/wiki/Vivec,_Hlaalu_Canton" title="Vivec, Hlaalu Canton">Hlaalu Compound</a> corridor, and one in the water near the <a href="/wiki/Vivec,_Arena_Canton" title="Vivec, Arena Canton">Arena</a>. All were armed. Only one, a mage, seems to have put up a fight. All had their throats slit with a dagger. Until the two Ordinators were killed, we thought it might be an anti-Imperial fanatic. And it still might be. The two Ordinators were found dead near the victim at Hlaalu Compound, and we think they coincidentally interrupted the killer at work. Both had their throats slit with a dagger. That neither Ordinator had drawn a weapon is extremely unsettling. It suggests either extraordinary stealth, or a very powerful sorcerer. That's all we know about the victims. And there's not much information from witnesses, either."</i></dd>
<dd><b>witnesses</b> <i>"There are no witnesses to any of the killings. But in Hlaalu compound, at about the same time of one of the killings, an outlander reported being threatened by Dunmer woman armed with a dagger. It was dark, and the outlander transported magically to safety, so he couldn't give us a very clear description. But he was sure the Dunmer <b>woman with a dagger</b> was dressed an a skirt and netch leather armor."</i>
<dl><dd><b>woman with a dagger</b> <i>"Yes. That's the only description we have. A Dunmer woman with a dagger, in a skirt and netch leather armor."</i></dd>
<dd><b>work</b> <i>"As I said, I cannot officially hire you for this task. But if you find and execute this killer, when you return to report your success to me, I promise you a handsome reward."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Is this about the <b>work</b> I mentioned? Or did you have other questions?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>work</b> <i>"According to your report, the Dunmer woman you killed matches the description given us. We'll dispatch Ordinators to follow up, But I believe you have identified and executed the killer. On behalf on the city, and of the Office of the Watch, thank you. And now for the reward I promised. I'll give you a choice. You may either have an <a href="/wiki/Indoril_Helmet" title="Indoril Helmet">Indoril helm</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indoril_Cuirass" title="Indoril Cuirass">cuirass</a>, or a <a href="/wiki/Belt_of_the_Armor_of_God" title="Belt of the Armor of God">Belt of the Armor of God</a>. The helm and cuirass are heavy armor, and useful only to a strong fighter. These items belonged to one of the Ordinators who were killed, and it is fitting that they should reward the one who avenged his murder. However, we ask that you don't wear this armor in Vivec City, for you may be mistaken for an Ordinator and guard. Alternatively, the Belt of the Armor of God provides magical armor and improves resistence against hostile spells, and should be useful for any adventurer. Which would you like?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>I'd like the helm and cuirass.</b> <i>"Very good. Please accept the helm and cuirass, with our thanks. And accept, on the behalf of Vivec City, our thanks for ridding us of this dangerous killer."</i></dd>
<dd><b>I'd like the belt.</b> <i>"Very good. Please accept the belt, with our thanks. And accept, on the behalf of Vivec City, our thanks for ridding us of this dangerous killer."</i>
