After his mother and father were slain by your ill breed, Vilandon spent his life trying to hunt you all down. It was his end, though. A vampire named Kjeld finally killed him, though it is said it was a long and bloody fight. But, that was hundreds of years ago. I will speak no more with you."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I have seen them around several times since, but they both seemed a bit shy and quiet -- and quite taken with one another -- so I didn't intrude. Perhaps you might ask the ladies of the town. A Dark Elven woman with a High Elven friend might excite comment."</i>
