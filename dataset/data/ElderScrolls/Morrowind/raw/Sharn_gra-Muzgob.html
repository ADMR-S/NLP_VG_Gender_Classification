<dl><dd><b>Bonemeal</b> <i>"Bonemeal is a fine-ground powder from the bones of man-like races. Alchemists have identified its magical properties, and use it in various preparations."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Bonewalker</b> <i>"Bonewalkers are among the distinctive ancestral revenants that guard Dunmer burial sites, and which may be summoned as spirit guardians. Among the undead, they are less worrisome than their more powerful manifestation, the Greater Bonewalker."</i></dd>
<dd><b>latest rumors</b> <i>"Ajira made a bet with Galbedir about who would get to the rank of Journeyman first. I hope it doesn't end with more flame atronachs in the guild library like last time."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Mages Guild</b> <i>"A rat's nest. Unsound practices. Slipshod scholarship. Politics. Lamebrains and lunatics. But essential for research. And worthwhile for the discounts on services, if nothing else. Marayn Dren here, she's not so bad. Good intentions. And Edwinna Elbert, over in Ald'ruhn. Interesting projects. A bit out of touch, perhaps. But sound and sensible."</i></dd>
<dd><b>necromancy</b> <i>"In the Empire, necromancy is a legitimate discipline, though body and spirit are protected property, and may not be used without permission of the owner. But in Morrowind, the Dunmer loathe necromancers, and put them to death. That's absurd, of course, since the Dunmer summon their OWN dead to guard tombs and defend the family. Sacred necromancy is righteous, while philosophical necromancy is evil. It's primitive superstition, that's all."</i></dd>

So you are this Nerevar hero, reborn? Do you remember anything from the life of this Nerevar? Can you think like him? Talk to him? Are you like a lich, with the spirit of this old dead hero riding your flesh? Very interesting, indeed. Here. Stick out your tongue. Can you feel it when I do THIS? I must make a careful examination of you for my... mystical studies."</i></dd>

</p>
<dl><dd><b>Errand</b> <i>"The errand, then, is very simple. I need the skull of <b>Llevule Andrano</b>. You'll find it in <b>Andrano Ancestral Tomb</b>. But take care not to upset the natives. The Dunmer have some peculiar primitive prejudices against necromancy, and take grave objection to unauthorized tomb visits."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Llevule Andrano</b> <i>"He was no one special. A journeyman enchanter. There may be many skulls in Andrano Tomb, but you'll have no problem recognizing Llevule's skull from the ritual markings."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Andrano Ancestral Tomb</b> <i>"The tomb is south of Pelagiad, just off the road, just before you reach the fork where the road goes southwest towards Seyda Neen and southeast to Vivec. You may need an enchanted blade. Some spirits are immune to normal weapons. Here. Take this old shortsword. And maybe these old scrolls will come in handy."</i>

<dl><dd><b>Errand</b> <i>"Yes, yes. You've completed the errand, and I'm quite satisfied."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Nerevarine cult</b> <i>"This Ashlander cult believes the long-dead hero <b>Nerevar</b> will be reborn to honor ancient promises to the tribes. According to legend, the prophesied <b>Nerevarine</b> will cast down the false gods of the Tribunal Temple, restore the traditional ancestor worship practiced by the Ashlanders, and drive all outlanders from Morrowind. Both Temple and Empire outlaw the cult, but it persists among the Ashlanders, who care little for Imperial or Temple law. Here. Take this copy of my notes on the topic for Caius."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine cult</b> <i>"I gave you a copy of my notes for Caius. Read them."</i></dd>
<dd><b>False Incarnate</b> <i>"The Temple refers to any demented impostor who claims to be the Nerevarine as "the False Incarnate." The Temple treats such persons as insane, and Ordinators pursue and imprison them "for their own protection." The Temple has reported that the most recent False Incarnate, a girl child named Peakstar, has died, but they've produced no body, and skeptics are suspicious of Temple claims."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Nerevar</b> <i>"Nerevar is a First Age hero of the Dunmer people. He was a great general and leader. He helped form the First Council, and united the Dunmer Houses against foreign invaders aided by the traitors of House Dagoth. He triumphed over Morrowind's enemies at Red Mountain, but died in the battle."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Nerevarine</b> <i>"The Ashlanders have a prophecy that the legendary hero Nerevar will be reborn. They call this reincarnated hero the 'Nerevarine'."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> <i>"Ashlander culture honors dream visions and prophecy, unlike the Temple and the Western cults, which regard visions and prophecy as primitive superstition. Wise women interpret dreams and visions, and pass them on to succeeding generations. The most common version of the Nerevarine Prophecy is THE STRANGER. Did you know that Nerevar was known to possess a magical ring named "One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star." Nerevar swore his promise to honor ancient Ashlander traditions and land rights on this magical ring."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Peakstar</b> <i>"The most recent case of a person claiming to be the Nerevarine is a girl child named Peakstar. After a long period of searching unsuccessfully for her, the Ordinators recently reported that Peakstar is dead. That may be true, but I haven't heard that the Temple has offered any convincing proof that she is dead."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
