<dl><dd><b>murder of Processus Vitellius</b> <i>"That fetcher? You're damn right I did him in, and a good thing, too. He was skimming a load of money from all of us honest people; overcharging us on our taxes and keeping the difference for himself. He was always flaunting his money around, showing off his new clothes and jewels. So, I killed the bastard, and left his body out there to rot, with all his ill-begotten gold still on him."</i>
<dl><dd><b>I believe what you say. I'll say nothing to the authorities.</b> <i>"Well, it's the truth. They've all been gouging us for years. The whole office is corrupt, I tell you. One of these days, they'll get exposed, I swear it! Here, though. This was his ring. Looks like his woman gave it to him. She should probably have it. She wasn't to blame in all this."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Sorry, that is no excuse for murder, and your punishment has been decided.</b> <i>"You're one of them, huh? Come to kill me? Well, give it your best shot, Imperial. I've no problem spilling more of the blood of the Emperor's lackeys!"</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
