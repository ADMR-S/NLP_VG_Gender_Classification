<dl><dd><b>I will try and lead you to this place.</b> <i>"Thank you so much. I know the Fields of Kummu are near the water; the view from there is supposed to be breathtaking. I've also been told there is a farm nearby where pilgrims may sometimes stop and rest weary legs."</i></dd>

<dd><b>Fields of Kummu</b> <i>"It was there that Lord Vivec met a poor farmer whose only guar had died. This farmer could not harvest his muckspunge without his guar, and could not provide muck for himself or his village. So, the Lord Vivec removed his fine clothes, laid them aside, and toiled in the farmer's fields, acting as a beast of burden until the entire crop was harvested. It is at the Fields of Kummu we go to pray for the same humility Lord Vivec showed on that day. I'll mark it on your map."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
