<p><i>"Hello, <span class="caption">Novice<span> (Rank)</span></span> <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>. My name is Kaye, and I'm in charge of the volunteer shrine sergeants for the cult. Are you ready for a shrine sergeant assignment?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>I'm ready for a shrine sergeant assignment.</b> <i>"Good. I could use a little help here. We treated a High Elf named <b>Caryarel</b> for swamp fever, but we later discovered that while he was here, a rare <b>Chapel Limeware Bowl</b> disappeared from our shrine. Will you find this Caryarel and retrieve our bowl for us? The High Elves are a small, tight-knit community on Vvardenfell. Try asking other High Elves if they know Caryarel and where he lives."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Caryarel</b> <i>"He was a tall, dark-haired fellow with sharp features -- but that description would fit a lot of High Elves. We were treating him for swamp fever, so perhaps he lives along the coasts, when mud crabs sometimes carry disease. As I said, try asking around among High Elves. I believe there are several serving in the Hawkmoth Legion Garrison here in Ebonheart."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Chapel Limeware Bowl</b> <i>"The bowl was a gift from a benefactor. It's a unique item, quite valuable, and it would be embarrassing if our benefactor were to visit and find it missing."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>I have something else to ask about.</b> <i>"Hmm. That's too bad. I could sure use some help here. But... go ahead. What can I do for you?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>shrine sergeant</b> <i>"A shrine sergeant helps keep order at the shrines, carries messages and packages, and sometimes escorts priests and lay servants on dangerous missions. This occassional service is ideal for bold, free-spirited adventurers like you. Supervising the shrine sergeants is my responsibility."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"Have you recovered the Chapel Limeware Bowl?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>No, but I'm working on it.</b></dd>
<dd><b>I'm sorry, but I can't seem to find that bowl.</b></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"Have you recovered the Chapel Limeware Bowl?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Yes, I have the bowl right here.</b> <i>"So you found Caryarel? And recovered our bowl? Well done! Here. Let me give you something to cover your expenses. And here are a few Divine Intervention scrolls. I never go anywhere without them. And when you're ready for another shrine sergeant mission, speak to me again."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Chapel Limeware Bowl</b> <i>"We're very glad to have it back. Now we have it in a safe place."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Caryarel</b> <i>"Well. I'm glad you were able to get the bowl without... well... excessive force. I appreciate a sense of restraint and judgement. Don't see it that often in Morrowind. I think you and I wil lget along just fine."</i>
<dl><dd><b><span class="caption">Caryarel<span> (If Caryarel died)</span></span></b> <i>"So. Caryarel is with us no more. I appreciate your telling me. But let me just say this, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>. You were there, and I wasn't. So it's your call, and I'll back you up. But if you can handle these shrine sergeant tasks with a minimum of killing... I think that's more in the spirit of the teaching of the Nine. If you're attacked first, then of course you're in the right. But even a bad life should never be cheap. End of sermon."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><i>"A Bosmer named <b>Nedhelas</b> in Caldera says his house is haunted by a ghost.

Talk to Nedhelas first, and report back to me if you get rid his <b>haunted house</b> of its ghost."</i>

Go to Asha-Ahhe Egg Mine, near the village of <b>khuul</b>, and if you find the witch Thelsa Dral, kill her. When you are sure the wicked creature is dead, return and report to me.

<p><i>"An acolyte named <b>Linus Iulus</b> disappeared some years ago. He was last seen leaving Suran headed east on foot for Zafirbel Bay. Recently our oracle, Lalatia Varian, has had a vision of a <b>Silver Staff of Shaming</b>, and Linus Iulus had one of these staves. Here is a Detect Enchantment ring and 100 gold for expenses. Go to <b>Mount Kand</b>. Find a Silver Staff of Shaming there, retrieve it, and bring it to me, along with any other personal effects you find that belonged to Linus Iulus."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Linus Iulus</b> <i>"Lalatia Varian gave him the Silver Staff of Shaming and sent him in search of a traitor who had betrayed the cult. I believe she knew he was not equal to the task, though he begged for the quest, and I think his death is a burden on her conscience. I doubt that any of his physical remains will survive years of exposure to the elements. But you might find his Maran Amulet and Stendarran Belt. It would be a comfort to pass them on to other lay servants, to honor the memory of Linus Iulus."</i></dd>

I don't understand the mumbo-jumbo of dream interpretation, but she tells me that an old name for Mount Kand is Mountain of Fear. As she reads her dream, she believes the staff will be found either east or west of the mountain, in the shadow of the rising or setting sun. The Detect Enchantment ring should help you find the staff."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Mount Kand</b> <i>"Mount Kand is in the Molag Amur region. Speak to Nevosi Hlan, shipmaster at the Ebonheart docks. Take a ship to Tel Branora; from there, you can get a ship to Molag Mar. From Molag Mar travel on foot north by roads, watching for signs to Mount Kand. I don't know the region myself, but I've heard it is wild and dangerous, and easy to get lost in."</i></dd></dl>
