<p><b>murder of Processus Vitellius</b> <i>"Processus, murdered! No! Tell me it's not so. He was the gentlest man I've ever met. He and I had become so close in the past few months...I don't know what I will do without him. I've only <b>seen him get angry</b> once or twice, and never raised a hand to anyone. This is so sad."</i>

<dl><dd><b>seen him get angry</b> <i>"Well, not even angry, I suppose. I saw him arguing once with Foryn Gilnith about his taxes. He thought Processus had been levying too much, and skimming off the top for himself. Ridiculous! Processus wouldn't have done such a thing, I'm sure of it. Please find out what happened, friend. And if you find out what became of <b>Processus' ring</b>, it would ease my heart."</i>
