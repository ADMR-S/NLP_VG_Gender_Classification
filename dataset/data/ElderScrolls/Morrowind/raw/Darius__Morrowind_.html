<dd><b>fines and compensation</b> <i>"The punishment for criminals in <b>Morrowind</b> is typically fines and compensation. The <b>fines</b> are collected by the state; the compensation goes to the injured party or his kin. That may sound like a sweet deal -- kill an enemy, then pay the fine -- but folks who have enough money to pay such fines are almost always House lords, and House Wars customs means the Great House of the victim usually buys a writ with the Morag Tong to assassinate the murderer. So murderers pay, and THEN they get killed, too."</i>
