<p><i>"Hello. I am Synnolian Tunifus. I manage the lay healer volunteers for our cult. If you are ready to accept a task as a lay healer, let me know."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>I'm ready for a lay healer task.</b> <i>"Mara be praised! So much to do, and so little time. Please, bring me five units of marshmerrow for <b>restore health potions</b>. <b>Balur Salvu</b>, a farmer in the western Ascadian Isles, near Pelagiad, grows marshmerrow. Bring him this potion as a gift, and he'll tell you where to pick the marshmerrow."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Restore Health potions</b> <i>"To make a Restore Health potion, combine two ore more of the following cheap and common ingredients in the <b>mortar and pestle</b>: <b>marshmerrow</b>, wickwheat, corkbulb root, and saltrice. It isn't easy, of course. If you aren't very skilled, you will often ruin the ingredients and fail to make the potion. But with practice and training, you'll improve. And a complete set of alchemical <b>apparatus</b> can improve your success rate."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Balur Salvu</b> <i>"Balur Salvo's farm is on the road just south of Pelagiad. The farmhouse is north of the road, south of the southwestern end of Lake Hairan. Just head north from Ebonheart. Don't take the bridge west towards Seyda Neen. When you hit the east-west road between Pelagiad and Vivec, turn right, east, towards Vivec, and Balur's farm is not far. If you reach a bridge, you've gone too far. Balur's a shrewd fellow. Ask nicely, and he might share his knowledge."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Mortar and Pestle</b> <i>"Mortar and Pestle is a bowl and grinding tool for mechanically reducing raw materials into the powders or pulps used in alchemical preparations."</i></dd>
<dd><b>marshmerrow</b> <i>"Tall stalk with triple radiating leaves at intervals along the stalk. Marshmerrow's good for restore health potios. Mixes with <b>corkbulb</b>. And what most folks don't know, corprus weepings also have healing properties."</i>
<dl><dd><b>corkbulb</b> <i>"Corkbulb is a huge bulbous root that protrudes from the ground, with green foliage about man-high. It grows wild, but is easier to find in cultivated patches near the farmhouses of the <b>Ascadian Isles</b>. I think there's a big patch of it just north of Dren Plantation; that's on many maps. And remember: we have an agreement with the plantation owners that lets us collect the corkbulb, so don't be shy."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Ascadian Isles</b> <i>"It's a land of lakes, farms, and plantations. Lately they've started a few netch ranches. You'll find plenty of marshmerrow, corkbulb, and comberry bush there. Saltrice, too. You can also find ash yam, black anther, gold kanet, green lichen, geather, stoneflower, and willow flower."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>apparatus</b> <i>"Making potions requires pieces of specialized alchemical equipment called 'apparatus.' Better quality apparatus are more reliable in their results, and produce a finer product. The four types of apparatus are: mortar and pestle, <b>retort</b>, <b>alembic</b>, and <b>calcinator</b>. Apparatus can be purchased from alchemists."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Retort</b> <i>"An retort is a vessel with a beaked cap or head used in alchemical processes to transform, purify, or refine raw materials into the sublime sustances used in alchemical preparations."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Alembic</b> <i>"An alembic is glass container in which the arcane properties of natural and supernatural substances are distilled from their raw ingredients. The substances are infused, then heated until vapor is produced. The vapor then condenses in a seperate container, precipitating the distilled elements with the desired magical properties."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Calcinator</b> <i>"A calcinator is a stove or crucible which reduces metals and substances to ash so their arcane properties can be seperated from the dross. They must be made of porcelain or iron device to withstand the high temperatures necessary to reduce certain substances to ash."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<p><i>"Have you brought me five units of marshmerrow? Or have you come to report your failure?"</i>

</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"I see you have brought me five units of marshmerrow. Here is a Restore Health potion for you, and a mortal and pestle so you can practice making your own Restore Health potions. Speak to me again when you are ready for another lay healer mission. And goodness! I was so busy, I almost forgot. Have you checked your advancement in the Imperial cult? As you serve Mara and the Nine, so shall you rise in rank."</i>

<p><i>"We need five units of muck for cure common disease potions. A farmer in <b>Gnisis</b>, Abishpulu Shand, has a muckspunge patch near his hut, and Chaplain Ogrul at Fort Darius has a deal with Shand to gather muck there for free. Let me put Gnisis on your map. And while you're in Gnisis, visit Chaplain Ogrul and give him these four Restore Health potions. And ask him if he'll teach you a few tricks. When you have the muck, bring it back to me. And here's 80 drakes for the silt strider fare. It's a long walk."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Gnisis</b> <i>"Gnisis is a small egg mining and trade village on the silt strider caravan route between Ald'ruhn and the northwest tip of Vvardenfell. It's the largest settlement in the <b>West Gash</b>, with a Legion garrison, Fort Darius, a Tribunal Temple, and a tradehouse. Gnisis is on the north side of the Ouada Samsi gorge; the Samsi runs from Gnisis west all the way to the Inner Sea. To reach Gnisis, take the silt strider from Vivec or Seyda Neen, then transfer through Balmora and Ald'ruhn to Gnisis strider port."</i>
<dl><dd><b>West Gash</b> <i>"The western highlands of Vvardenfell are called the West Gash. The largest settlement is the trading village of Gnisis, north of Ald'ruhn, and the fishing villages of Ald Velothi and Khuul lie on the north coast. Muckspunge grows there, and I have collected chokeweed and roobrush as well."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Practice, practice, practice! Speak to me again when you are ready for another lay healer mission. And remind me to check on your advancement in the cult. You deserve recognition for your labors."</i>

His house is on the mainland, just north of the Foreign Quarter. A cleric stealing from criminals to aid the needy... perhaps I have been hanging around Zenithar-worshippers too long."</i>

<dl><dd><b>Gurak gro-Bagrat</b> <i>"Gurak gro-Bagrat, netch rancher, horticulturist, and smuggler, lives just north of the bridge from the Vivec Foreign Quarter to the mainland. Everyone knows he smuggles skooma, but he's got friends in the Legion, and Camonna Tong protection, so no one will touch him. Perhaps it is wrong, but I steal <b>willow anther</b> from the willow flowers he grows outside his manor. Be careful. Gurak gro-Bagrat is a dangerous criminal. Under NO circumstances enter his home. Do NOT try to speak to him."</i>

The closest reliable source of scribs is the <b>Shulk Egg mine</b>, southwest of Balmora, on the west bank of the Ouadi Oadi, near a swinging bridge.

The old suspension bridge across the Odai is just southeast of the mine entrance. A path leads through a break in the mountains from the Pelagiad-Balmora road, but the turnoff isn't marked. It may be easiest to go all the way to Balmora, then head south from the gate near the strider port, climb over the ridge, keeping the river on your left. Watch for the fire of the mining camp at the entrance."</i></dd></dl>
