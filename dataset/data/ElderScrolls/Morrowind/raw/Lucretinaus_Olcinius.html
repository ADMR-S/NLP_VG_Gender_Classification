<p><b>Cassius Olcinius:</b><br/><i>"My son is what??? That explains why I haven't seen him for days. He's a good boy, just a bit out of touch with things. I really appreciate you helping him out here. I'd do it myself, but I really can't take the time to leave the store. Here, take this to help you along."</i><br/>(After paying Cassius' debt) <i>"I see that you paid the debt my son owed. I thank you for your help. Here is a reward for all your efforts."</i><br/>(If the Nerevarine has already paid Cassius' debt before speaking to him) <i>"You've paid the wizard my son's debt? I thank you. This should cover the money he owed, and a little something for you as well. Your efforts are appreciated."</i>
</p><p><b>debt to pay:</b><br/><i>"Cassius did what??? What??? Oh, that foolish boy. Still, he's mine, and I do love him. Here, take this money and repay his debt for me. It amazes me what young people will do sometimes."</i><br/>(If the Nerevarine has already paid Cassius' debt before speaking to him) <i>"A debt to that wizard? Foolish boy. The number of times I've heard about stupid things Cassius Olcinius has done would turn your head."</i>
</p><p><b>Fevyn Ralen:</b> <i>"Fevyn isn't a bad sort, for one of those wizards. From what I hear, he does an excellent job, but his prices can be rather steep."</i>
