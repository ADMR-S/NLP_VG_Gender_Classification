Then for no reason, she turned on me! Put me under some spell, and by the time I realized what was happening, she had taken off with my gold, my armor, and my axe, Widowmaker! Damn her for even laying hands on the axe of my fathers! I'll tear her throat out and wear it as a belt! Come with me, stranger; help me find this devil and end her pitiful existence!"</i>
