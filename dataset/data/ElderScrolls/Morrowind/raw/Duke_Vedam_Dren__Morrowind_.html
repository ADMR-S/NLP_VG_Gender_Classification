<dl><dd><b>Background</b> <i>"I am Lord Vedam Dren, Duke of Ebonheart and Vvardenfell."</i></dd>
<dd><span class="caption"><b>business</b><span> (If the player has not reached the rank of House Father in the Great House Hlaalu)</span></span> <i>"Perhaps I will discuss business with you when you have earned a higher rank in House Hlaalu."</i></dd>
<dd><span class="caption"><b>business</b><span> (Being expelled from House Hlaalu)</span></span> <i>"Surely you do not expect me to discuss business with you when you have broken the rules. You must make amends, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Dunmer</b> <i>"It will be difficult to overcome the Dunmer's lingering resentment of Imperial occupation. Ironically, it is now, in the face of the menace of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain, that we have a great opportunity to unite natives and colonists against a common threat. When the Dunmer fight side by side with outlanders like you against the hosts of Dagoth Ur, our common peril and purpose must unite us."</i></dd>
<dd><span class="caption"><b>latest rumors</b><span> (During "The Path of the Incarnate")</span></span> <i>"I'm told you claim to be the Incarnate -- Nerevar reborn according to legend. My father used to say, 'When you hear something unbelievable, don't believe it.' From what I hear, your story is remarkable enough without relying on ancient prophecies. I suggest you stand upon your reputation, and leave superstitions to the prophets and holy men."</i>
<dl><dd><span class="caption"><b>latest rumors</b><span> (As Hortator)</span></span> <i>"The Great Houses have named you Hortator? Remarkable. My staff have kept me up-to-date on your adventures, of course. But uniting the fractious Great Houses under a single war leader is a remarkable achievement. Now you must marshal the Great House forces against Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House."</i>
<dl><dd><span class="caption"><b>latest rumors</b><span> (As Nerevarine during "Hortator and Nerevarine")</span></span> <i>"The four Ashlander tribes have named you Nerevarine? Remarkable. My staff have kept me up-to-date on your adventures, of course. But uniting the squabbling Ashlander tribes under one ashkhan is a remarkable achievement. Now I hope you will lead the tribes in our war against Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House."</i>
<dl><dd><span class="caption"><b>latest rumors</b><span> (As Nerevarine and Hortator during "Hortator and Nerevarine")</span></span> <i>"So you have been named Hortator and Nerevarine, fulfilling the Nerevarine prophecies. I would not have believed it. But my informants assure me it is true. If now you can also achieve a reconciliation with the Temple, you may be able to unite all of Morrowind's force against Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain."</i>
<dl><dd><span class="caption"><b>latest rumors</b><span> (After completing "Hortator and Nerevarine")</span></span> <i>"The Archcanon has announced that Lord Vivec has selected you as a champion of the Temple in the war against Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House. Now the fate of Morrowind and its people lies in your hands."</i>
<dl><dd><span class="caption"><b>latest rumors</b><span> (After defeating Dagoth Ur)</span></span> <i>"You have slain Dagoth Ur, defeated the Sixth House, and ended the Blight, Nerevarine. That's all anyone is talking about now, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>little advice</b> <i>"Don't make enemies. If someone is determined to be your enemy, then fight. But do not turn friends or potential friends into enemies through arrogance or carelessness."</i></dd>
<dd><b>little secret</b> <i>"Orvas Dren is my brother. I don't know what you've heard of him. I won't defend everything he's done. But don't become his enemy."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Morrowind</b> <i>"Morrowind is a peculiar mixture of Dunmer tradition and Imperial modernism. The council system of government works well, and the Temple provides shelter, education, and health for all. At the same time, the Legions and magistrates guarantee rule of law and justice, and free trade makes us prosperous. Looking forward, we must overcome lingering resentments by engaging the Great Houses in the creation of a new Morrowind rooted in Dunmer tradition but incorporating the best features of Imperial civil society."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Morrowind lore</b> <i>"We have grown too complacent about the threat of Dagoth Ur and Red Mountain. For ages we've relied on the Tribunal to contain the menace. But Dagoth Ur's power is waxing as the Tribunal's power is waning. The Legion garrisons here are insufficient to protect our settlements, and there's no hope for reinforcements. Our people have always relied on a charismatic leader to rally squabbling factions against a common foe. Now would be a good time for such a leader to emerge."</i></dd>

In the case of the Orcs at Alof's farm, however, I've heard that the leader is the Barbarian Burub gra-Bamog. She is wanted for murder, theft, and banditry. If Burub is gathering forces in Ashunartes, I want someone to put a stop to it."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Orcs at a Daedric ruin</b> <i>"You have prevented the Barbarian Burub gra-Bamog from becoming a threat to Vvardenfell and for that you have my gratitude."</i></dd></dl></dd>

Cavortius Albuttian is the head of the Imperial Guard, my palace guard. Frald the White, Knight Bachelor of the Imperial Legion, is the head of the Hawkmoth Legion Garrison. Lalatia Varian is the head priest of the castle's Imperial cult shrine. The wealthy Canctunian Ponius is the chief factor and banker of the East Empire Company."</i></dd></dl>
