<dl><dd><b>recover some gold</b> <i>"That's right. See, I had a bad run of luck playing Nine-holes, and lost a bit of money. Normally, I'd be fine. We can usually keep some gold in our pockets just from the money the locals pay us for...protection. But I know some of them are holding out on me, especially that little fetcher Fargoth. He's come up light the past couple of weeks when I've shaken him down. I know he's stashing it somewhere. I'd like you to find <b>Fargoth's hiding place</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Fargoth's hiding place</b> <i>"I know the little fetcher's got one somewhere in town. Just not sure where yet. I've already gone through his whole house, so I know he's not hiding it there. I'd like you find out where he's stashing his gold. If you can, I'll give you a share of the wealth. Are you up for it?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>I'll do it.</b> <i>"Excellent. Here's what I want you to do. I'm not sure where he goes, but I know he wanders around town at night. Watch his movements. The best vantage point is on top of the lighthouse south of town. That will give you a nice view of all of Seyda Neen. If you keep an eye on where he goes, I'm sure you'll be able to figure out where he's hiding that gold."</i></dd>
<dd><b>No thanks.</b> <i>"No? Well, I'll find someone else to do it, then."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Fargoth's hiding place</b> <i>"Good that you found that for me, friend. I'll make that little fetcher pay for lying to me. Although, I've got to be honest, it is kind of fun messing with the little guy. I like to take <a href="/wiki/Engraved_Ring_of_Healing" title="Engraved Ring of Healing">something</a> from his place and stick it in that old barrel in the Census and Excise courtyard.
