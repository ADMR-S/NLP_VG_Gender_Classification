<p><b>little secret</b> <i>"Have you heard about poor Ienas Sarandas? He lost his patrimony betting on the guar. Sold every piece of the family silverware to pay his debts. A pity. I think it's driven him a bit mad. Wears clothes fit for a lord, and hasn't got a drake for a meal."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Ienas Sarandas</b> <i>"The young fellow's family has lived in Ald'ruhn a long time. His parents died recently and left him their house and estate. But Ienas has fallen in with a fast crowd. I believe he's taken to drinking expensive liquor and has incurred some gambling debts. He's a charming lad, everyone likes him, but he's not very sensible, and suddenly becoming rich seems to have made him an irresponsible fool."</i></dd></dl>
<p><b>Greeting</b> <i>"I'm Daynes Redothril, the Pawnbroker. And you are... [PC Name]? Shall I tell you about my trade? Or would you perhaps be interested in doing a little work for me?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>work</b> <i>"I am looking for a fellow named Ienas Sarandas. I sold him two fine matched rings, one with an raw ebony stone, the other with a raw glass stone, but he has failed to pay the remaining 150 drakes owed. If you will find Sarandas, and either get the ebony ring and the glass ring and return them to me, or get the overdue payment of 150 drakes he owes me, I will pay you 50 gold."</i>
<dl><dd><b>work</b> <i>"I see you have the ebony ring and the glass ring from Ienas Sarandas. Here are the 50 drakes for your services. Thank you very much."</i></dd>
<dd><b>work</b> <i>"I see you have the ebony ring and the glass ring from Ienas Sarandas. Here are the 50 drakes for your services. And thank you very much for handling this situation so well. I really appreciate it."</i></dd>
<dd><b>work</b> <i>"I see you have the ebony ring and the glass ring from Ienas Sarandas. And I hear Ienas Sarandas was found dead in his home. I don't suppose YOU had anything to do with that? Here's the 50 drakes I promised you. And I'll take the goods. But don't expect me to thank you for them. No debt is worth a man's life. Of course, there were no witnesses. But everyone knows you killed that poor fool. Don't think anyone here will forgive you for that."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
