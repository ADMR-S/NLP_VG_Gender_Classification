<p><i>"Hello. I am Iulus Truptor. I manage the volunteer almoners for our cult. If you are ready to accept a fund raising project as an almoner, let me know."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>I'm ready for an almoner project.</b> <i>"Thank Zenithar! We have so many projects, and so little gold. Go ask the <b>Skyrim Mission</b> in Ebonheart for <b>alms for the poor</b>. They should give generously to support the Imperial cult. Our fund raising goal for the Skyrim mission is 100 gold. When you have reached our goal, return and deliver the gold to me."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Skyrim Mission</b> <i>"The Skyrim Mission is Skyrim's diplomatic embassy to Vvardenfell District. Leave the Imperial Chapels, pass through the Grand Council Chambers, cross the bridge, then down the stairs, out through the gate. As you look south from the gate, the Skyrim Mission is to the right, west of the well."</i></dd>
<dd><b>alms for the poor</b> <i>"The Imperial cult asks for donations from members and friends of the faith to support our good works. As a custom, we ask for alms for the poor, because most of the gifts go to feed, cloth, cure, and heal the less fortunate, but in fact the donations go to support various worthy causes and special projects. Collecting alms is just one of the many tasks our more faithful members perform in the service of the Nine."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>I have something else to ask about.</b> <i>"Then what can I do for you?"</i></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"Have you reached our goal of 100 gold in donations from the Skyrim mission? Or have you come to report your failure?"</i>

And accept this small blessing as a token of our thanks. When you're ready for your next almoner mission, speak to me again."</i></dd>
<dd><b>I have DOUBLED our goal!</b> <i>"Excellent! You've far exceeded our expectations. Surely you have a touch of Zenithar in your soul. Please accept this small token of our gratitude and encouragement. And when you're ready for your next almoner mission, speak to me again."</i></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Go ask the <b>Argonian Mission</b> in Ebonheart for alms for the poor. Their province is not so rich as Skyrim, but they are a generous and civic-minded people. Our fund raising goal for the Argonian mission is 100 gold. When you have reached our goal, return and deliver the gold to me."</i>

<p><i>"The shrine at Buckmoth Legion Fort has experienced an unfortunate shortfall in alms for the poor, and funds are urgently needed to purchase food and blankets for orphans and indigents. Please go to <b>Ald'ruhn</b> and see if you can raise the money for the Buckmoth Fund. The fund needs at least 100 drakes immediately. It may be difficult to raise funds, since Ald'ruhn is a Redoran town, and most residents are <b>Dunmer</b>, but this money is very badly needed."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Ald'ruhn</b> <i>"Ald'ruhn is the district seat of House Redoran, and a large settlement. Travel by guild guide is the best method. Head north from Ebonheart by road, take the bridge into Vivec's Hlaalu Compound, pass through Redoran Compound, find the Guild of Mages on the upper level of the Foreign Quarter. Pay a guild guide at the Guild of Mages for transport to Ald'ruhn."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Dunmer</b> <i>"The Buckmoth fund, based in Fort Buckmoth, serves the citizens of nearby Ald'ruhn.

And <b>Cunius Pelelius</b> is a part of the trust who received the exclusive Imperial charter to exploit the rich ebony deposits of Caldera Mine, so he must be a very wealthy man, and more than able to spare 500 drakes for such a worthy cause. Unfortunately, every time we ask Cunius Pelelius for the donation, he says he is very busy at the moment, but he will be happy to discuss the donation at a later date. I suppose he plans to keep deferring the obligation indefinitely until we abandon hope. We must have that money for the Widows and Orphans Fund. You'll just have to find some way to impress upon him the urgency of our cause. We have the greatest faith in you. We know you'll succeed."</i>
