<dl><dd><b>I wish to prove my worth.</b> <i>"You are brave or foolish. Perhaps both. This, then, is your chance to prove your courage. My Razor, slayer of man and mer, scourge of all who stand before it, lies dormant. Stolen by an unworthy bearer, and elf of little courage or consequence, it lies unused, gathering dust in the Alas Tomb near Molag Mar. Return it to me, mortal. Prove yourself to be a worthy bearer of Mehrunes' Razor."</i></dd>

<p><i>"You've found my Razor. Good. Can you feel its hunger? Can you feel its frustration? Now, I will make it again what it once was, what it shall always be. Draw a line of blood across the land in the name of Mehrunes Dagon!"</i>
