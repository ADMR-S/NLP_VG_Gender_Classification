</p>
<dl><dd><b>Apologies</b> <i>"I'm afraid I was rather drunk last night when I ran into Trebonius Artorius, that arrogant fool. It seems that the drink took over my tongue, and I called him a Flat-Head. Now I have a horrid rash. No matter what I do, now matter how many potions I use or spells I cast, it won't go away. I've tried everything! If you give him my most sincere apologies, maybe he'll make it go away. I'd do it myself but I'm feeling a little under the weather. I'll pay you 50 gold for your trouble."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Sure, why not?</b> <i>"Good. Take this book to him, and tell him I'm truly sorry. You'll find him in the Mage's Guild here in Vivec. He's a rather powerful wizard, as I've learned."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Apologies</b> <i>"Well, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>, I thought you said you were going to help. I won't pay for a favor not done."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>I've got troubles enough of my own, thanks</b> <i>"Hmmm... well, suit yourself. I'm sure it will go away on its own."</i>
