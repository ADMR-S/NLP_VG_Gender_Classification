My parents were bound in slavery, and I have lived in Morrowind all my life. Like other Argonians who have accepted Imperial ways, I am much like any other Imperial citizen. But to be honest, we have always been a private, even secretive people, and I am not comfortable speaking in this manner. You might do better to look in books, if you are curious."</i></dd>

But pauper and commoner do not suffer from war here as they do in the West, thanks to the honored traditions of House War and the Morag Tong. I am an Argonian, yet they treat me with respect. If you are curious, find a copy of "The Black Glove." But please... do not mistake us for the Dark Brotherhood! The Dark Brotherhood is a perversion of ancient Dunmer traditions. They have sold their honor for profit, and are no more than a league of murderers-for-hire."</i></dd></dl></dd>

<dd><b>slavery</b> <i>"I am an Imperial citizen, and I believe slavery should be outlawed, as it is elsewhere in Tamriel. Many of Tamriel's people once practiced slavery, but have now rejected it as cruel and immoral. I hope that in my lifetime, slavery might be outlawed in Morrowind, but the Armistice confirmed slavery as lawful, and the Great Houses strongly resist any diminishment of the rights guaranteed by that ancient agreement between the Empire and the Dunmer."</i></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Yes, thank you very much. We should be free from distraction here. Now, I said I'd tell you about the <b>Nerevarine cult</b> so you can report back to Caius. And I don't know of any <b>Sixth House cult</b>, but I can tell you what I do know."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine cult</b> <i>"To understand the Nerevarine cult, you must understand the <b>history of the Ashlanders</b>. Nerevar means something very different to the <b>Ashlanders</b> from what he means to Dunmer of the <b>Great Houses</b>. You should also know about the <b>persecution of the Nerevarine</b>, and the legacy of the <b>False Incarnate</b>, for the Nerevarine cult is at the heart of the ancient conflict between the nomadic Ashlanders and the settled Great House Dunmer. Here is a summary for Caius, but ask your questions, and I'll answer in detail."</i>
<dl><dd><b>history of the Ashlanders</b> <i>"In the First Era, the nomadic Ashlanders and the settled Dunmer clans were much alike, but after the First Council and the formation of the Great Houses, Ashlanders have been steadily forced into the poorest and most hostile lands. Now the nomadic tribes look to the prophesied return of the Nerevar for a restoration of their ancient rights and religious tradition."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ashlanders</b> <i>"The Ashlanders hate the House Dunmer, who have become soft, and who have abandoned traditional ancestor worship for the gods of the Tribunal. And the Ashlanders hate outlanders, who invaded and stole their land, and forced them to live as a subject people. A reborn Nerevar who could drive out the outlander invaders, destroy the false worship of the Tribunal, and restore the pure traditional life and faith of the nomads would be a very popular here to the Ashlanders."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Great Houses</b> <i>"In modern times Morrowind is ruled by five Great Houses: House Hlaalu, House Redoran, House Telvanni, House Indoril, and House Dres. Great Houses culture is partly defined by its roots in ancient Dunmer tribal clans, and partly bu later Imperial influences from other Western cultures. The Great Houses culture is only one of the native Dunmer cultures of Morrowind. The other native culture, the Ashlander culture, is a nomadic barbarian culture largely untouched by Imperial influences."</i></dd>
<dd><b>persecution of the Nerevarine</b> <i>"The Temple treats the Nerevarine prophecies as heresy, and the Temple imprisons and executes heretics, unless prevented by Imperial law. But, since the Nerevarine cult is hostile to the Empire, the Empire does not interfere when Temple persecutes the cult. Ashlanders hate the Temple, and particularly the Ordinators, for their ruthless treatment of Nerevarine cultists."</i></dd>
<dd><b>False Incarnate</b> <i>"In the past, some have claimed to be the reincarnated Nerevar. The most recent is know as Peakstar, a figure of legend among the Wastes tribes for the last 30 years. The Temple says these false Incarnates disprove the prophecies, since the false Incarnates fail and come to nothing, but the mystical Nerevarine cult glorifies rather than shrinks from contradictions, citing the appearance of "failed Incarnates" as certain proof of Nerevar's coming rebirth."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Sixth House cult</b> <i>"I've never heard of such a thing. House Dagoth was the Sixth House, but in the War of the First Council, they betrayed the other Great Houses, and were destroyed for their treason. But I've never heard of anyone worshipping them. Dagoth Ur, the ancient head of House Dagoth, is the Devil of the Tribunal faith, but I've never heard of anyone worshipping him, either."</i></dd></dl>
