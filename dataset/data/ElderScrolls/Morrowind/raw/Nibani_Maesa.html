<p><i>"So. They've told me of you, outlander. Or, shall I say, Clanfriend. You are hard-headed. And ignorant. But perhaps it is not your fault. My lord ashkhan says you will ask me about the <b>Nerevarine prophecies</b>. He also says I will test you against the Nerevarine prophecies. I must do as my lord ashkhan says. So ask your questions, and I will test you."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> <i>"There are many Nerevarine prophecies, and they suggest many things. <b>Aspect and uncertain parents</b>. <b>The moon-and-star</b>. <b>Sleepers</b>. <b>Seven curses</b>. The curses' bane. The prophecy of <b>the Stranger</b>. The prophecy of <b>the Seven Visions</b>. The <b>lost prophecies</b>. Ask me about these things. If you are patient. If you would be wise. Or, if you are impatient to know, just ask: 'Do I <b>pass the test</b> of the Nerevarine prophecies? Go ahead, outlander. I am the wise woman. Ask your question. And I will answer."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Aspect and uncertain parents</b> <i>"If what you say is true, you are indeed born on a certain day of uncertain parents. This is part of the prophecy. But many have the same birthday, and many are not sure of their parents. It is interesting. But it does not make you the Nerevarine."</i></dd>
<dd><b>the moon-and-star</b> <i>"Legend says Indoril Nerevar's family standard bore the moon and star, and Nerevar's armor and weapons bore this sign. Some say he bore a moon-and-star birthmark. Some say he has a magic ring marked with a moon-and-star. Others say he was born under a moon-and-star. In any case, I think the moon-and-star is the mark of the Nerevarine, and you do not have this mark. So you are not the Nerevarine."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Sleepers</b> <i>"Rumors say that in the towns, mad cultists called "sleepers" are attacking peope, saying that Dagoth Ur has awakened, and will drive the outlanders from Morrowind. Perhaps it is just a coincidence. But I think it is a sign of the Nerevarine. Not necessarily a sign that YOU are the Nerevarine. Perhaps the time of the Nerevarine has come. And you have come at the same time. This is not passing a test. But it may mean you have some part to play in the coming of the Nerevarine."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Seven curses</b> <i>"It is another Ashlander prophecy of the Nerevarine. It is called "The Seven Curses of the Sharmat." But I do not know it, and I know no one who does. It may be lost. Such things happen. A wise woman dies, or forgets, or a clan is wiped out. Perhaps someone knows, but is keeping it secret. Perhaps it is in one of those many books of your settled peoples. I have heard that the Dissident priests of the Temple may have such books."</i></dd>
<dd><b>the Stranger</b> <i>"This is the best known of the Nerevarine Prophecies. We call it 'The Stranger'.</i></dd>
<dd><i>When earth is sundered, and skies choked black,</i></dd>
<dd><i>And sleepers serve the seven curses,</i></dd>
<dd><i>To the hearth there comes a stranger,</i></dd>
<dd><i>Journeyed far 'neath moon and star.</i></dd>
<dd><br/></dd>
<dd><i>Though stark-born to sire uncertain</i></dd>
<dd><i>His aspect marks his certain fate.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Wicked stalk him, righteous curse him.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Prophets speak, but all deny.</i></dd>
<dd><br/></dd>
<dd><i>Many trials make manifest</i></dd>
<dd><i>The Stranger's fate, the curses' bane.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Many touchstones try the stranger.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Many fall, but one remains."</i></dd>
<dd><b>the Seven Visions</b> <i>"The full title of the prophecy is "Seven Visions of <b>Seven Trials</b> of the Incarnate". Listen, and I wil ltell you the verses."</i></dd>
<dd><i><b>Seven trials</b></i></dd>
<dd><i>What he puts in his hand to, that shall be done.</i></dd>

<dd><i>He speaks the law for Veloth's people.</i></dd>
<dd><i>He speaks for their land, and names them great.</i></dd>
<dd><br/></dd>
<dd><i>What does this prophecy mean? It tells us who the Nerevarine wil be, and the trials he must undergo before he fulfills his destiny. Some parts I understand. Some parts I do not. I will answer your questions as best I can. But I cannot pretend to understand it all."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Seven trials</b> <i>"The Incarnate cannot fail. What others have tried, he will do. What Nerevar started, the Incarnate shall finish."</i></dd>
<dd><b>First trial</b> <i>"This refers to your <b>birthsign</b> -- to your birth on a certain day to uncertain parents, just like in the Stranger prophecy."</i>
<dl><dd><b>birthsign</b> <i>"In Tamriel, persons born under certain constellations are said to be 'fortunate in their aspects.' Such persons are often blessed -- or cursed -- with remarkable abilities or weaknesses as a result of the magical conjunctions of celestial influences."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Second trial</b> <i>"I'm not sure what this means. Will the Nerevarine come as a spirit who is not harmed by blight or age? I don't know. But I think Curse-of-Flesh means the blight disease corprus, which causes terrible, distorted growths on its victims. Perhaps the Nerevarine can heal this disease. Perhaps that will be a sign of the Nerevarine."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Third trial</b> <i>"In legend there is a shrine to Azura called the Cavern of the Incarnate. There are secrets I may not tell you about this cavern. Do not ask."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Fourth trial</b> <i>"A "Hortator" is a war-leader chosen when Dunmer great houses must put aside their normal feuds to unite against a common enemy. This has not happened since the Empire invaded our land."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Fifth trial</b> <i>"The Ashlanders are sometimes called the Velothi, for the prophet Veloth who guided us to this land many, many centuries ago. And the Four Tribes are the four tribes of Vvardenfell, the <b>Urshilaku</b>, the <b>Ahemmusa</b>, the <b>Zainab</b>, and the <b>Erabenimsun</b>. It would truly be a miracle to unite these four tribes who have so long raided and warred with one another. But the Nerevarine must be one who performs miracles."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Urshilaku</b> <i>"The Urshilaku are the Ashlanders of the northern Ashlands and the West Gash. I am the wise woman of the Urshilaku, and the Ashkhan Sul-Matuul is our chief, a brave and respected war leader, and Warrior-Protector of the Nerevarine cult."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Ahemmusa</b> <i>"The Ahemmusa of the Grazelands are mild and peace-loving. The wise woman of the Ahemmusa, Sinnammu Mirpal, is also their ashkhan."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Zainab</b> <i>"The Ashlanders of the Zainab tribe are sly and crafty. Their camp is in the interior of the Grazelands."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Erabenimsun</b> <i>"The Erabenimsun of Molag Mar love themselves and their weapons above all else. Their Ashkhan Ulath-Pal is cruel and ambitious, and his gulakhans are just like him. Their Wise Woman, Manirai, is cautious and reasonable. Seek her counsel. Don't waste your speech on the war khans."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Sixth trial</b> <i>"I am not sure. "The tribe unmourned" may mean the Sixth House, House Dagoth, which was exterminated after the Battle of Red Mountain. But it may also mean the Dwemer, or the Dwarves, as Westerners call them. And "eating sin" is doing atonement for another's sin."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Seventh trial</b> <i>"'The cursed false gods' must be the Tribuna. They are surely false gods, evil sorcerers and necromancers, and they murdered Nerevar so they might set themselves up as gods. "Binds the broken" must refer to Nerevar's broken promise to the Ashlanders to honor the ways of the Spirits and rights of the Land."</i></dd>
<dd><b>One destiny</b> <i>"Veloth's people are the Dunmer, all Dunmer, Ashlander and Great House. The last time the Velothi were united were with Nerevar at the Battle of Red Mountain. Now Nerevar will come once again and unite the Dunmer. He will restore Morrowind to the Dunmer, and restore the former greatness of the Velothi people."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>lost prophecies</b> <i>"There are Nerevarine prophecies that have been lost. The Seven Curses. And others. Some are forgotten. Some hidden. Some deliberately lost. The wise women are the memory of the Velothi people. But it is a faulty memory, and we are mortal, and our knowledge dies with us. But we hear that the Dissident Priests of the Temple study our Nerevarine prophecies, and record them in books. Such written words never die. You must go to them and ask for these books, and bring what you find to me."</i></dd>
<dd><b>pass the test</b> <i>"You are not the Nerevarine. You are one who may become the Nerevarine. It is a puzzle, and a hard one. But you have found some of the pieces, and you may find more. Do you choose to be the Nerevarine? Then seek the lost prophecies among the Dissident priests of the Temple. Find the lost prophecies, bring them to me, and I will be your guide. And take these copies of the Stranger and the Seven Visions. Now. I have told you all I know. Go. Think on what I've told you. And do what must be done."</i>

You, blessed by Azura, must lift the seven curses of Dagoth Ur. Prophecy has shown the seven steps of the Nerevarine's path, and I have been chosen as your guide for each step on that path. I will read the signs, and show you the way. It is time for you to walk the path of the Seven Visions, and pass the <b>Seven Trials</b> of the Seven Visions. You are born on a certain day to uncertain parents. So you have passed the first trial. My dreams show me that you also fulfill the second trial, that 'neither blight nor age can harm him/The-Curse-of-Flesh before him flies'. I have read the signs, but I cannot understand. Can you explain this to me?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Tell how I got corprus disease and was cured</b> <i>"That you have overcome the Curse-of-Flesh is strange enough, but that it should protect you from blight and age is past belief. Yet the signs of my dreams are clear. You have passed the second trial. But the third trial is unfulfilled. The mystery of the third trial is not my secret to share. Go to Sul-Matuul, the guardian of our cult, and he shall tell you of the third trial. When you have fulfilled the third trial, return to me for guidance on your next steps on the path of the <b>Nerevarine</b>."</i>

When you have been named 'Nerevarine' by each of the four Ashlander tribes of Vvardenfell, come to me for further guidance, for you will have passed the Fifth Trial."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Hortator</b> <i>"When a greater enemy threatens, the Great Houses put aside their quarrels and choose a Hortator, a single war leader to lead all the Houses. Only a Great House council can name a Hortator, and all councils must agree. Speak with the <b>Redoran councilors</b>, <b>Hlaalu councilors</b>, and <b>Telvanni councilors</b>. Prove to them that Dagoth Ur threatens. When you are named <b>Redoran Hortator</b>, <b>Hlaalu Hortator</b>, and <b>Telvanni Hortator</b>, only then will you be the Nerevarine named in prophecy."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Redoran councilors</b> <i>"Go to Ald'ruhn, the chief town of the Redoran. They say the councils meets under the shell of a giant Emperor crab. The Redoran are proud and haughty, known as great warriors and great worshippers of the Tribunal. Since they love the Temple and Vivec, they cannot love you. The Temple warriors hate the Nerevarine prophecies, and will kill you if they see you. Be careful."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Hlaalu councilors</b> <i>"Go to Balmora, the chief town of the Hlaalu. I believe the councilors meet there in a great house with many rooms. The Hlaalu are soft and cowardly, sly and greedy. Their traders are liars and cheats. Look behind the words they speak for the truths they are hiding."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Telvanni councilors</b> <i>"I am told that wizards who speak for the Telvanni councilors may be found in a strange building in Sadrith Mora. The councilors themselves are ageless sorcerers living in the towers scattered over Vvardenfell. I know nothing about them, except that they are old, terrible, and evil."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Redoran Hortator</b> <i>"I do not know the ways of the settled people. But I do know, in the council of chiefs, you must cultivate a friend, and beware an enemy. Find one who is willing, or who is well disposed to you. Win him, and use him to win the others. And the most powerful chief, he is most likely an enemy, since he loves his power, and hates to share it. Recognize your enemy, and prepare for him."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Hlaalu Hortator</b> <i>"The Hlaalu are great traders, keen for profit, and subtle with words. It will be hard to find someone you can trust -- perhaps impossible. You may have to fight with words to find the truth. Beware of tricks and lies. Seek behind appearances. Look for hidden power. Be wary. Be suspicious."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Telvanni Hortator</b> <i>"I do not know the ways of wizards. I have heard they honor the tests of life and death, as we do. The ones who live, live a long time. The ones who die are forgotten. They are old, and strange, and terrible. I know little. But I am afraid. And that is my counsel to you. Be afraid. It is not time to be bold and careless. It is no time to hoard your treasures. With wizards, there are no second chances."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
