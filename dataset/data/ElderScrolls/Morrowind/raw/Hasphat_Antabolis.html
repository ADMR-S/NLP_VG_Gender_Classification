<p><b>Disappearance of the Dwarves</b> <i>"The disappearance of the Dwarves predates Imperial written records; Dunmer oral accounts record that the Dwemer were utterly destroyed by the gods for profane practices and impiety. Dwarven ruins are scattered across Tamriel, and weapons, armor, housewares, coins, and other items of Dwemer design are often found, but the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the Dwarves remains one of Tamriel's greatest mysteries."</i><br/>
<b>Morrowind history</b> <i>"I won't bore you blathering about history. That's what Caius is for. But if you're really interested, try 'On Morrowind, the Imperial Province', by Erramanwe of Sunhold. I have an extra copy you can have. What an adventurer like you REALLY needs is a sense of <b>current events</b>. Who hates who? Where's trouble brewing? That's where opportunity lies for an outlander like you."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>current events</b> <i>"The Great Houses hate each other -- theft, murder, assassination, secret raids, standard stuff. The Temple is trying to kill off a rebellious faction called the Dissident priests. Ashlander nomads raid each other, attack traders and pilgrims. A secret cult is killing off Imperial citizens. All bad enough. The real problem, though, is the Blight. Monsters and diseases. The natives say it comes from Red Mountain. It's been a local problem for years, but lately it's gotten badly out of control."</i></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Good day, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>. So you're with Caius, eh? And Caius wants information? Of course, there's a this-for-that involved. I require a <b>favor</b> first, and then I'll tell you what you want to know."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Favor</b> <i>"There are Dwemer ruins nearby called <b>Arkngthand</b>. I need you to run over there and find me a little cube with a circular design and some symbols on one side. It's called 'a 'Dwemer puzzle box'. Bring me back the <b>Dwemer puzzle box</b>, and I'll tell you what you want to know."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Favor</b> <i>"Right. As I said, get me the Dwemer puzzle box from Arkngthand, and I'll tell you what you want to know."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Arkngthand</b> <i>"The old Dwemer ruins at Arkngthand are extensive on the surface and underground. Head south out of town past the silt strider port, then cross bridges east over the Odai River. At the signpost, head north towards Caldera. Immediately on the right see a signpost for Molag Mar. Turn right and head uphill on an old road to cross an ancient Dwemer bridge over Foyada Mamaea. The entrance to Arkngthand is on the east side of the <b>foyada</b>, south of the bridge. Turn a crank on a pipe nearby to open the doors."</i>
<dl><dd><b>foyada</b> <i>"'Foyada' means 'fire-river' in the native Ashlander language. The deep, ash-dark ravines which run down from the Red Mountain volcano are foyada. The lava from Red Mountain is very fluid, and it runs almost like water, and during an eruption, fire-rivers run down the mountain, clearing the ravines of vegetation. Because they have good footing, are clear of brush, and run long sitances, the natives use them like roads."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Dwemer puzzle box</b> <i>"The little cube I'm looking for is about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger. It will be made of a coppery metal, with a circular design and symbols on one side and some lined marks on the other side. That's all I want, that little cube."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><i>"So. Have you done that <b>favor</b> I asked?"</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Favor</b> <i>"Perfect. Just what I was looking for. Just let me take this <b>Dwemer puzzle box</b>, and then I'll tell you what Caius will want to know about the <b>Sixth House</b>. And about the <b>Nerevarine</b>. By the way, the inscriptions on the box seem to be the directions for setting a Dwemer key to open a specific lock. If you're interested, after you've delivered your report to Caius, come back, and maybe I'll have a key you can take back to Arkngthand."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer puzzle box</b> <i>"Yes. The inscriptions on the box seem to be the directions for setting a <b>Dwemer</b> key to open a specific lock. If you're interested, after you've delivered your report to Caius, come back, and maybe I'll have a key you can take back to Arkngthand."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer</b> <i>"The Dwemer are the fabled lost Dwarven race whose ruins and splendid artifacts are scattered across Tamriel. Elves use the term "Dwemer," connoting variously "deep-delving," "profound," and "close-counseled"; Imperial usage is "Dwarven," derived in fable from the affectionate regard of the Giant races for their "little" Dwemer friends. There are several <b>Dwemer sites</b> on Vvardenfell, and many have found <b>Dwemer artifacts</b>."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer sites</b> <i>"There are many Dwemer sites on Vvardenfell, but the two largest are Mzuleft and <b>Nchuleftingth</b>. Mzuleft is in the Sheogorad region, is cursed and dangerous, and acces is forbidden. Nchuleftingth is occupied by an expedition of the Imperial Archaeological Commission, and is not open to visitors."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Nchuleftingth</b> <i>"Look, I like you, but not enough to tell you that."</i>
<dl><dd><b><span class="caption">Nchuleftingth<span> (At a high enough disposition)</span></span></b> <i>"My friend, Senilias Cadiusus, is the head of the Nchuleftingth expedition, and he is accompanied by his charming daughter, Pania Cadiusus. The <b>Dwemer language</b> has never been translated, and they are searching Nchuleftingth for a book that may be a Dwemer translation key. Here. Let me give you a letter of introduction. They might be willing to hire you."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Nchuleftingth</b> <i>"I encourage you to visit Senilias Cadiusus. Make sure you bring the letter of introduction I gave you."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Dwemer language</b> <i>"The Dwemer language is largely untranslatable, though the alphabet is known, and short inscriptions can be deciphered, usually from context clues. Fortunately, many Dwemer documents were written in Aldmeris, which is very close to modern Elven languages."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Sixth House</b> <i>"<b>House Dagoth</b> is the Sixth House, the 'lost' Sixth House. In the First Age, House Dagoth betrayed the other Great Houses during the War of the First Council, and was destroyed for their treason. I can answer any questions you have, but I'll also give you some notes to give to Caius, and recommend some <b>Sixth House references</b> he should read."</i>
<dl><dd><b>House Dagoth</b> <i>"House Dagoth was the Sixth of the Seven Dunmer Great Houses. Nothing remains of the Sixth House. Its members were all slain or adopted into other Great Houses following their treason in the War of the First Council. Their clanstead was called Kogoruhn."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Sixth House references</b> <i>"Here's a list of cheap books; all of them will tell you something about the Sixth House and how it ended: 'The War Of The First Council,' 'Saint Nerevar,' 'Nerevar Moon-And-Star,' and 'The Real Nerevar.' Try the bookseller Dorisa Darvel over in the Commercial District. She'll have at least some of these titles."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Nerevarine</b> <i>"The Ashlanders believe a reborn Nerevar will unite the Dunmer against the outlander invaders and restore the ancient Dark Elven nation. Nerevar is a legendary hero abd saint of the Temple, but the Temple denies the prophecy, and persecute heretics who believe in the Nerevarine. Tell Caius that Sharn gra-Muzgob would be a better person to ask about the native faiths and superstitions."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><i>"Hello again, <span class="caption">Nerevarine<span> (Player name)</span></span>. What do you want? You already gave me the <b>Dwener puzzle box</b>. Don't you remember?"</i>
</p>

</div>, <div class="diabox">
<p><b>Divine Metaphysics</b> <i>"I cannot read the Dwemer language, nor do I know anyone alive who can. Dwemer scholars have long been looking for a translation key. It is said that some of the oldest Telvanni have somehow learned the Dwemer language, but these may only be rumors."</i>
</p>
<dl><dd><b><span class="caption">Divine Metaphysics<span> (While carrying "Hanging Gardens")</span></span></b> <i>"With the "<b>Hanging Gardens</b>" book as a key, I can make out some of what "Divine Metaphysics" is saying. It seems to suggest that new gods may be crafted through some kind of sorcery. I do not know much of magic. Perhaps you should speak with someone who is both a wizard and a scholar."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Hanging Gardens</b> <i>"Did you tell Senilias Cadiusus of this? This may be the translation key they have been searching for. If you find any other Dwemer books, perhaps I could try and translate them with this key."</i></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b><span class="caption">Egg of Time<span> (While carrying "Hanging Gardens")</span></span></b> <i>"This "Egg of Time" is certainly very suggestive.
