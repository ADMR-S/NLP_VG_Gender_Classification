<p><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Yes, outlander. I am Kausi, gulakhan of the Ahemmusa Ashlanders. Why are you here? What do you want?"</i>

</p><p><b>Ashlander</b> <i>"We are the Ahemmusa tribe of the Vvardenfell Ashlanders. This is Ahemmusa camp, the last place of the Ahemmusa. All the other places are gone. The Urshilaku have the good lands to the west. The Zainab have the good lands to the south. And the blight has taken our lands, has driven us to this last camp. And even here we have no safety, for the red taint takes our herds and kills the game. The blight-sick animals and blight monsters kill our people. Soon we will all die, and the Ahemmusa be forgotten."</i>

</p><p><b>Nerevarine</b> (after the quest "The Path of the Incarnate") <i>"Do you come to claim the name of Nerevarine? I hope you come to do the deeds of the Nerevarine. We need the deeds, not the name. You must speak to the wise woman, <a href="/wiki/Sinnammu_Mirpal" title="Sinnammu Mirpal">Sinnammu Mirpal</a>. We are a poor, sad tribe, without an <a href="/wiki/Ashkhan" title="Ashkhan">ashkhan</a>, and led by a wise woman. And we are its gulakhans. We say this with shame, for we are as weak and helpless as children. Go to her, outlander. Tell her you will do the deeds of a hero, and save the Ahemmusa. Maybe then you will have earned the name 'Nerevarine.'"</i>

<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> (after talking to Sinnammu Mirpal) <i>"You claim to be the Nerevarine? Then find a safe place for the Ahemmusa. That would be proof enough for me."</i>

I don't know what signs others may need, but I have my proof. Thank you, Nerevarine. You shall have the support of the Ahemmusa."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> (after the quest "The Path of the Incarnate") <i>"We have heard of these prophecies. We have heard of an outlander who comes to claim the name of Nerevarine. What good are these prophecies? Where is this hero who comes to save us? Our herds, our people, our lands die, and no one will help us. Who is this Nerevarine?"</i>
