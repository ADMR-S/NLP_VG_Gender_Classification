<dl><dd><b>generous pledge</b> <i>"You are from the Imperial cult, then? I'll be frank with you, but you must keep this in confidence. I cannot redeem my pledge at this time. Our clerk <b>embezzled funds</b>, and to avoid scandal, I am covering losses to the East Empire Company out of my own fortune."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Offer to track down the clerk and recover the gold.</b> <i>"That is a most welcome offer. Our clerk, an Altmer named <b>Mossanon</b>, absconded with 3000 drakes. We have no idea where he went. To avoid scandal, we have not reported the crime to the guards. If you can track this Mossanon down and recover the missing 3000 drakes, I would be more than happy to immediately redeem my generous pledge to the Imperial cult."</i>
<dl><dd><b>embezzled funds</b> <i>"Our clerk Mossanon took 3000 drakes in gold from our treasury. Since he kept all accountings, we didn't even suspect the gold was missing until he disappeared."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Mossanon</b> <i>"He was an excellent clerk, a proper High Elf, well-spoken, diligent, orderly, good with figures, reliable -- until recently. I believe we all noticed a change in his behavior, but thought nothing of it. In particular, we noticed a marked rise in his absences from the office. We have been reluctant to discuss the subject with the other employees, for obvious reasons. But perhaps, if you are discreet, and persuasive, you may learn something from speaking with them."</i></dd>
