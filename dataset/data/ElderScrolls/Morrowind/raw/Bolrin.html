<p><i>"Greetings, friend. I understand you've had some dealings with the Company before. Perhaps you'd like to be of <b>further assistance</b>?"</i>

<dl><dd><b>further assistance</b> <i>"Yes. I have some work that would be suited to someone not officially linked to the Company, although it may be dangerous. Perhaps you'd be interested in a bit of <b>information gathering</b>?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>information gathering</b> <i>"There is a Telvanni enchanter in Vivec--<b>Audenian Valius</b>. I believe you helped him with a nasty little rat problem. Shame, that was. He has a rather exclusive clientele, and he sells very exclusive products at quite a large profit. It would be of interest to the Company to know who his clients are, and to know what items they require. If you can bring me a list of these clients and items, I would be most appreciative."</i>
<dl><dd><b>I will help you get the list.</b> <i>"That's the attitude we like here at the Company. Go quickly and quietly. No one should know the details of your business. And if you are discovered, the Company will deny all knowledge of your existence. Good luck."</i>
<dl><dd><b>information gathering</b> <i>"We must take advantage of every opportunity we can."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Audenian Valius</b> <i>"You will find him in the Telvanni section of Vivec. I'm not that familiar with the city myself; perhaps someone there can give you a more precise location. He is powerful, and his store will likely be guarded."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>I cannot help you.</b> <i>"Hmmm...a pity. Perhaps you are not the person I thought you to be. This conversation, of course, never took place. You understand, I'm sure."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><b>information gathering</b> <i>"Ahhh...you've gotten the list! This will prove most advantageous. Business is all about having even a little advantage over your competitors. You have done well. Take this as a reward. And mention this to no one."</i>
