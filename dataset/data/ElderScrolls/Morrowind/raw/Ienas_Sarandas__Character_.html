<dl><dd><b>Offer a sympathetic ear and friendly advice.</b> <i>"Indeed, it is as you say. '...Nor encumber myself with profitless treasures, but shall share freely among house and hearth.' I have forgotten the Grace of Generosity, the words of Lord Vivec. You are right to remind me of <a href="/wiki/Saryoni%27s_Sermons" title="Saryoni's Sermons">Saryoni's Sermons</a>. I've been a fool.
