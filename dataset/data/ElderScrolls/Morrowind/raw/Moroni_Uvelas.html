<dl><dd><b>gone missing</b> <i>"Yes...my husband, Danar Uvelas, is missing again. It happens with him. See, he has a problem with skooma, although he swears he's been trying to stop. Last time he disappeared it was for days, and when he came back, he didn't look so good. I'm worried that he might have been infected with corprus, or something equally horrible. Do you think you might be able to find him for me?"</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>I will find your husband.</b> <i>"You will? I can't tell you how relieved that would make me. Danar and his no-good friends sometimes take to the Underworks near here when they've got some skooma. You might find him down there."</i></dd>
<dd><b>I cannot help you.</b> <i>"No? Well, I can't blame you. My problems are my own, and I've no reason to expect anyone else to help me out."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>
