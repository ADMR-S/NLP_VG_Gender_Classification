<p><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Yes, outlander. I am Dutadalk, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gulakhan" title="Gulakhan">gulakhan</a> of the Ahemmusa Ashlanders. Why are you here? What do you want?"</i>
</p><p><b>Greeting</b> (after the quest "<a href="/wiki/The_Path_of_the_Incarnate" title="The Path of the Incarnate">The Path of the Incarnate</a>") <i>"You are [PC Name]. We have heard some say you are the Nerevarine. For a long time the Ashlanders have heard of the Nerevarine prophecies. Perhaps some would say the Ahemmusa are bitter. But talk gives us no comfort."</i>

<dl><dd><b>Ashlander</b> <i>"We are the Ahemmusa tribe. Ahemmusa camp was the last safe place of the Ahemmusa, but it is safe no longer. The blight has taken our lands, our herds, our game, our people. The red clouds spoil our herds and kill the game. The blight-sickness kills our herds and cripples our people. These are the last days of the Ahemmusa."</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine</b> <i>"Speak to the wise woman, Sinnammu Mirpal. Tell her you will find a safe place for the Ahemmusa. That is what I would wish to hear from one who wants to be named Nerevarine."</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Nerevarine prophecies</b> <i>"You must forgive us. Perhaps these are great days. Perhaps the prophecies are fulfilled. But to the Ahemmusa, all we know is that hunger and disease stalks us, and monsters prey upon us. A hero reborn may be a wonderful thing. But it means little to us, unless we have a safe place."</i>
